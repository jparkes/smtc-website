I
don't know the age of the above photo attached to the memorial, but it has a
small chip in the center and otherwise is in good shape. The picture of the photo
above was made with a Cannon G3 Digi-Cam set at 4 Mega-pixels in Macro Mode
using a tripod. <i>Photo and
information by 2nd Great-Grandson Wayne Austin June 19, 2003</i><p></p>
