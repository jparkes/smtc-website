<font size="2"><b>THOUGHTS ON FUNERALS</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;by Jack Dugger, 2004</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For a long time I have given some thought to the subject of
funerals and the customs concerning them that I have observed. I would guess
that one�s idea of funerals is based on the custom in the community where one
was reared. I always thought that funerals were barbaric. As a small boy and a
teen-ager, I helped dig a number of graves at the Glenwood Cemetery near our
home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Southport, Maury Co, TN, where I grew up, the custom was
after the body had been<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>embalmed,
dressed and placed in a casket it was returned to the dwelling place of the
deceased. The casket would be opened and interested family members, friends and
relatives would gather for the wake. It was not unusual for as many as six or
eight men to �sit up� all night with the body.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the selected time, friends, relatives, family members
would gather for the formal �funeral.� Several songs would be sung by a
group that had been selected to sing and a speaker, usually a preacher of the
same religious faith as the deceased would speak. After the formal funeral, the
casket would be placed in a hearse by selected pallbearers and the funeral
director would lead a procession to the graveyard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A grave would have been dug and prepared by a number of men
in the community where the deceased lived. The casket would be lowered into the
grave using strong ropes. Usually a wooden box would have been constructed for
the casket to be placed in the grave. It would have two two-by four planks laid
across the bottom of the box so that the ropes could be removed. (In<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>later years, funeral directors brought a casket lift device that was so
constructed to let the casket slowly down into the grave.) A top was placed on
the box around the casket and the boards that had been cut for the purpose were
laid across the grave just over the top of the box. Then, volunteers would
shovel the dirt back into the grave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the grave was filled and the dirt mounded up over the grave, the funeral
director would take a shovel and carefully pat and shape the dirt on top of the
grave. He would then place any flowers that had been sent for the funeral on the
mounded grave. The preacher or speaker would then complete his remarks and
perhaps offer a prayer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tom Williams of the Williams Funeral Home in Columbia and
Mt. Pleasant, TN, told us this tale. He was called to bring a casket and come
down in the County, (Maury), to bury a man. No other instructions were given</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tom did as he had been requested and when he arrived at the
location as it had been described to him, there were several men in overalls
standing around a cabin on the side of a rather steep hill. He asked several of
them to help him get the casket up the hill and into the cabin. There he found
an elderly man lying on the floor of the cabin. He asked if he shouldn�t shave
and dress the body in some fashion and the men told him, �throw him in that
casket.� This he did and then closed the lid so the men said, �let�s go
bury him.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When they finally reached the small graveyard, a grave had
been dug and Tom was told �Put the casket in the grave.� Tom asked if anyone
wanted to make any remarks and he was told, �cover him up.� When this was
finished Tom asked the man who pulled out the cash from his overall bibb pocket,
why they didn�t show more respect to the dead man. He was told, �That was
the way that man lived. He hated everybody and everything and that�s the way
we buried him.�<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When we lived in Hendersonville, TN, Bill Cole told me that
he had been the embalmer and funeral director for Cole and Garrett Funeral Home
in Goodlettsville, TN. In the country, at that time, farmers and country people
were seldom embalmed. One spring, a farmer in Sumner County finished eating his
noon meal of greens from his garden with green onions, etc. and he dropped dead
before he could leave his chair at the table.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Bill took a
casket and after dressing the body but not embalming it, placed it in the casket
and set it up for viewing at the man�s house. As was the custom there were
five or six men �setting up� with the corpse overnight. As they were sitting
and talking, there was a rather loud noise like a horse snorting. They all
looked around but everything seemed to be in order so they settled down again to
sit and talk and they heard the same noise. It then became evident to them that
the sound was coming from the casket. They quickly an quietly filed out of the
room. None of them showed the slightest interest in going back in to check on
the body.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The old deceased farmer�s food that he had eaten for
lunch began to �gas off� and escape his lips making a snorting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>noise. When Bill arrived back he found a group of men really �shaken
up� and standing outside the house in the yard when he went back to bury the
body after a funeral service. He said that he got absolutely no help from any of
the men that had been sitting up that night.</p>
