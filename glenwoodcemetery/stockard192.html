</font>I (Wayne Austin) remember my mom (Ruby Barlar Austin, b. 1912) affectionately mentioning her
Great Aunt Tennie Stockard in the 1950s to us children. She had a high regard for Tennie.
So we see how someone's good reputation can live on for many years (at least for
my life span) beyond their life. Kids are you listening. </font> <i></br>
