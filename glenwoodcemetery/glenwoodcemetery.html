<center>Glenwood
Cemetery was founded around the old Glenwood Cumberland Presbyterian Church still standing
across from the Campbellsville Pike from the Cemetery. The cemetery is located
10
miles south of Columbia Tennessee on the Campbellsville Pike on your left and is
well recognizable as a modern expanding cemetery. For more information on this cemetery see the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries. There you will find a complete listing up until about 1988. Included in this book are&nbsp;histories and
some biographies of those interred in this cemetery that are not included here.&nbsp;</font>
