STORY, Anderton Tillmon and wife Mary Lorena (PILKENTON) STORY were buried here
according to a genealogy written in 1980 by Sarah BUTLER POSEY. The daughter of
Anderton Tillmon &amp; Mara Lorena STORY, Mattie Florence Tennessee STORY
married Andrew Jackson HENDRICKS. This writing by Sarah (CROSS) BUTLER POSEY in
1980 shows that Anderton and wife died in 1913 and are buried at GLENWOOD
CEMETERY here in Maury Co. Sarah showed that Mary Lorena was born 12 July 1847,
so somebody must have had a Bible record to have the exact date. Elnora's (a
great granddaughter) family's house burned, so they don't have any Bibles. Sarah
BUTLER POSEY thought that she got this information from Mrs. Clyde AUSTIN (Eula
STORY AUSTIN), whose father was a brother of Mattie Florence Tennessee STORY.<br>

Researcher Virginia Alexander also has a copy of the Civil War records on
Anderton Tillman Story. He was in Clack's 3rd Tennessee Infantry. Was captured
at Ft. Donelson, then joined again when the unit was reorganized, and was
terribly wounded at Raymond, Miss. He was later captured at Cassville, GA, and
taken to Rock Island Prison, where he was released in May, 1865. He also drew a
Confederate Pension.<br>

There are open spaces for unmarked graves around the Story
grave lots. [WA 4/24/07]&nbsp;</font></center><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
