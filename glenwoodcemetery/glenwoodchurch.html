Across the Campbellsville Pike from the cemetery stands the old Glenwood
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Its colorful history has long since faded from our memories.
Soon
the structure will be gone if action is not taken. Cows graze at random now
all around its once majestic grounds where children played and studied about
Jesus. The adults 
</b>
<b>worshipped their
creator, and </b><b>caught
up on the latest in the community.  <i> <br/>
 If you know the history of this church
write in and we will include it here.</i> <i>Photo &amp; info by
