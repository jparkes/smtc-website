<CENTER><b>MATTHEWS, Joe L.,
28 Jun 1872 - 15 Dec 1932. <i>If I must give advice here I would say the it is
likely that Joe is the son of W. R. H. &amp; Fannie J. Matthews. This is based
on judgment related to the
proximity of the graves and Joe's birth date. (See W.R.H. Matthews) From there
if you are interested in that relationship you could proceed to build a a solid
case proving that relationship with other records. So goes the study of
genealogy. Photo and information by
