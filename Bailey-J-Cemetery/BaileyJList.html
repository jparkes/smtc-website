</p>

<p>Take Hampshire Pike out of Mt. Pleasant to Needmore. Turn north an Gibson
Hollow Rd. and go 1/2 mile to the old Boshears place (1988). When the road forks
take the right fork.&nbsp; The graveyard is located about 1/4 mile from the fork
in the road, on a lane that goes thru a farm home yard and continues back. The
cemetery is just the other side of the two new barns (one barn on either side of
the road) on the right side of the lane beside a stump and a tree.</p>

<a href="BA01.html">BAILEY, Elizabeth</a>, 12 Mar 1786 - 8 Sep 1842. (wife of
James Bailey, Box tomb.)</br>
<a href="BA01.html">RICKETTS, Sarah E.</a>, 6Aug 1845 - 22 Jan 1850.&nbsp;</br>

<p>&nbsp;This cemetery has been shrunk to about a 15' x 15' foot area with all
the stones piled on top of the two Box tombstones. Mr. Fred Hawkins in 1988 said
there are some 10 to 15 graves marked by fieldstones. If that is true the
evidence today has been obliterated, probably by farm animals.</br>
