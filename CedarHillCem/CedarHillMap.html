Red Arrow is pointing northward at the Cedar Hill Cemetery. Columbia is on our
right out Hwy 412 and Hampshire (near county line) is on our left. This is
located on the south side of Hwy. 99/412, about half way between Cross Bridges
and Hampshire.&nbsp;</br>

</font></b><b>As you can see this is in the
Curry Branch&nbsp; - East Fork Valley with high hills all around hwy 412. In
your Auto trip you
have climbed part way up English Hill and rounded the curve southward, then back
westward, and then started a gradual incline downward before the cemetery will
appear in your sights. Notice this map shows a church on the north side of the
road. That is the Cedar Hill Church of Christ an active congregation today. </br>
Go to this cemetery with love and appreciation for your/the heritage of this
great community. Going there for any other reason will invoke the fierce loyalty
of this community and you will wind up in deep trouble.</br>
