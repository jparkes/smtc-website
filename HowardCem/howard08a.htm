  1853 - 13 Aug 1867. 'Daughter of J. &amp; N. Howard. <i>Stone
  discovered later, photographed and sent in by David King of Georgia.</i> <i>Thanks
  David. This stone is in the possession of Mr. King of Georgia and in his back yard
  leaning against a pine tree somewhere in GA. He says the old family gave him
  permission to own this stone, (believe
  it or not!) I think it should be returned to this graveyard as it is against 
	the law to desecrate a graveyard, but at least he had the fortitude to let 
	this be known.</i></font></p>
