  <p>To which Charges and Specifications the Accused pleaded as follows:</p>
  <p>To Specification to Charge: Not Guilty</br>
  Charge: Not Guilty</p>
  <p>Dr Stockard was first introduced as a Witness on the part of the
  Prosecution and after being duly sworn by the Judge Advocate in the presence
  of the Accused, in answer to interrogations though the Judge Advocate,
  testified as follows.</br>
  </br>
  </p>
  <p>1st Int. State your name, residence and profession?</br>
  Ans. W. P. Stockard. I am a practicing physician at Mount Pleasant.</p>
  <p>2nd Int. State what you witnessed of the shooting of Wm F. Coffey at Mount
  Pleasant, Tennessee. State when it was and all circumstances in your knowledge
  connected therewith.</p>
  <p>Ans. It occurred about the 22nd or 23rd of August last, so far as I
  recollect, in the afternoon. I had stepped out of my office near the hotel
  when I noticed a squad of Federal soldiers several of whom were near the
  hotel. Among them, I recognized Howell who did the shooting. A short time
  after this I noticed William Coffey (deceased) and his brother-in-law John
  Blakely riding into the village.</p>
  <p>They dismounted and came up to the hotel where several citizens and
  soldiers were sitting, shaking hands with all as they came so far as I saw. He
  seated himself on a bench, one or two men above where Howell was sitting.
  After sitting a very few minutes I observed Howell get on his horse. This
  Howell was named Major Howell, commonly known as Buck Howell. Howell went
  across the square to a blacksmith shop. After a few minutes he came back
  accompanied by the Prisoner. They rode up in front of the hotel within (15)
  feet of where Coffey was sitting when the Prisoner spoke to the Deceased
  saying, &quot;How are you, Bill&quot; or something of the kind. Coffee
  returned the salutation with &quot;How are you, Mr. Morrow.&quot; The Prisoner
  then asked Coffey if he ever heard that it was his (Morrow's) intention to
  waylay and kill him (Coffey).</p>
  <p>Coffey replied that &quot;He had not.&quot; The Prisoner then asked if
  Coffey thought that he (Morrow) was afraid of him (Coffey) or if he didn't
  think he had the courage to come up openly if he wished to kill him (Coffey)
  instead of waylaying him. Coffey replied that he knew no reason why Morrow
  should be afraid of him and that if the (Prisoner) wished &quot;to kill him
  but do it openly.&quot; This question was repeated twice and answered pretty
  much the same, Coffey adding that he didn't want him (Morrow) to be afraid of
  him, that he &quot;wished no difficulty&quot; with him or any other man.</p>
  <p>The Prisoner than asked Coffey if he was armed or if he carried any arms.
  Coffey replied that he had no arms nor carried any arms. That is about all I
  recollect of passing between the Prisoner and Coffey. Then this Buck Howell
  (before mentioned), turning to Morrow said, &quot;I reckon we had better shoot
  him (Coffey).&quot; To this, though addressed to the Prisoner, the Deceased
  answered, you have me in your power, you can do as you choose, or something to
  that effect. I heard the Prisoner say nothing in reply. I did not see him make
  any sign or gesture of assent or dissent; he sat still on his horse. Howell
  then drew his pistol and shot Coffee twice. The first shot apparently killed
  Coffee. I judged from the expression of his face that the first shot killed
  him. I examined the body. One shot entered the breast and ranged downward
  cutting the heart or large blood vessel close to the heart and lodged in the
  spine. The other shot entered the neck just below the clavicle, passed through
  the neck and lodged in the spine. Coffey did not live over three minutes from
  the shots, probably not so long. I think either wound was mortal. I recollect
  nothing said by the Prisoner after the shooting. After the shooting Howell
  ordered me to examine Coffey and see if he was dead. I hesitated somewhat for
  Howell was preparing to shoot a third time. I then went up and took hold of
  Coffey and told Howell that he was dead. Howell got off his horse and came up
  to the body and turned it over.</br>
  Howell asked me if I took Coffey's pistol. I said I had nothing to do with it,
  that I disliked to see men settling their difficulties that way. Several of
  them said that it was well for me that I did not. I think Accused was one of
  those making this remark but am not positive. Howell and the Prisoner were
  armed. The Prisoner had his gun lying across his lap. Shortly after the
  shooting, five minutes perhaps, the Prisoner and Howell rode off. I don't
  think the Prisoner dismounted at all.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. State the manner and tone of the Prisoner during this conversation
  with deceased?</br>
  Ans. I don't think it was angry. It did not seem to be in a quarrel. Prisoner
  seemed to be inquiring about a report he had heard.</p>
  <p>4th Int. State the character of the deceased as a citizen.</br>
  Ans. He was a highly respectable man, highly esteemed by his neighbors as far
  as I know. He was a very peaceful man. I had heard of his having some trouble
  with the Prisoner, but this was the only case I ever heard of.</p>
  <p>Crop Examination</br>
  1st Int. How long after Howell made the remark &quot;I reckon we had better
  shoot him,&quot;</br>
  was the shooting?</br>
  Ans. It was almost instantly followed by the shooting.</p>
  <p>2nd Int. Did anyone try to prevent the shooting?</br>
  Ans. I spoke to Howell &quot;to not shoot,&quot; He made no reply.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. Was there time for any active interference to prevent shooting?</br>
  Ans. Not unless by the Prisoner who was very near. I think the Prisoner
  objected to Howell's shooting a third time as Coffey was evidently killed. I
  think Sergt. Wysnack also told Howell not to shoot again.</p>
  <p>4th Int. Were the two shots fired in immediate succession?</br>
  Ans. They were as quick as he could bring the pistol to bear.</br>
  </p>
  <p>5th Int. Was the shooting done with a revolving pistol?</br>
  Ans. It was.</p>
  <p>6th Int. In which hand was he pistol held?</br>
  Ans. In the right hand.</p>
  <p>7th Int. Did the Prisoner attempt to use his gun?</br>
  Ans. I saw no attempt whatever to use it.</p>
  <p>8th Int. Was there not others there armed besides Howell and the Prisoner?</br>
  Ans. I think a squad of soldiers had their guns.</p>
  <p>9th Int. How many persons were present?</br>
  Ans. At first there were a dozen soldiers perhaps and two or three citizens.</p>
  <p>10th Int. Was there anything said during this conversation about the
  connection of the Prisoner with the Federal Service?</br>
  Ans. Not that I heard.</p>
  <p>11th Int. Had Mr.Coffey been connected at any time with the Rebel army?</br>
  Ans. He had once been a lieutenant in theRebel army.</p>
  <p>12th Int. How long did he serve in the Rebel army?</br>
  Ans. He was in at Ft. Donelson. He then left the Rebels and was about a good
  many months. He did not stay long but came back and gave himself up and took
  the oath of amnesty as I understand. I did not see him take the oath but have
  good reason to believe he did take it.</p>
  <p>13th Int. How long have you known the Prisoner?</br>
  Ans. I have known him a long time, pretty well for ten years.</p>
  <p>14th Int. State the reputation of the Prisoner for that time as a citizen?</br>
  Ans. So far as I know he has the reputation of being a peaceful and quiet man.</p>
  <p>The witness was then permitted to retire.</br>
  </br>
  </p>
  <p>Dr. Jourdan was next introduced as a witness on the part of the prosecution
  and after being duly sworn by the Judge Advocate in the presence of the
  accused testified as follows.</p>
  <p>1st Int. State your name, residence and profession?</br>
  Ans. J.P Jourdan. I am a physician and reside at Mount Pleasant, Tennessee..</p>
  <p>2nd Int. State what you witnessed of the killing of Wm F. Coffee at Mount
  Pleasant.</p>
  <p>Ans. I was coming up towards the tavern when I saw some soldiers in front
  of the hotel, Howell and the prisoner amongst them. The Prisoner recognized
  me. I shook hands with him and I said something about so old a man as he being
  a soldier. He replied that he was able to do the duty of a soldier. I passed
  near the tavern door and sat down on a long bench on the pavement. I also
  noticed Mr.Coffey who said, &quot;How do you do Mr. Morrow.&quot; Morrow then
  asked (Coffey) if he (Coffey) had not said to some one that he (Prisoner}
  intended to waylay and kill him (Coffey). Coffee replied that he had made no
  such statement to any one.</p>
  <p>Morrow asked Coffey if thought that he (Morrow) would do such an act as
  that. Coffey replied that he thought Morrow had firmness or bravery to meet
  any man openly with whom he had a difficulty. I think previous to this Morrow
  asked Coffey if he was armed. Coffey replied he was not. The Prisoner asked
  Coffey if he thought he (Prisoner) was afraid of him (Coffey). Coffey replied
  that he was afraid of no man himself and that he wished no man afraid of him,
  that he sought no difficulty himself .This is all I remember that passed
  between Morrow and Coffey. At the time, the Prisoner was on his horse in front
  of Coffey, ten or twelve feet from him. Howell and the Prisoner were side by
  side in front of Coffey. During the conversation I don't think Howell said
  anything. Howell, after this conversation, said he believed he might as well
  kill him (Coffey) and drew his pistol and fired immediately. He immediately
  fired a second time. Each shot took effect on Coffey and either shot would
  have killed him. After the first shot Coffey was sitting erect. Coffey died
  immediately of the shots received. He never said a word after being shot.
  After I came out of the house the Prisoner and Howell were gone.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. State the manner and tone of the conversation?</br>
  Ans. They did not talk like men quarreling. There was no abusive language used
  by either. It was evident from the conversation that there was no good feeling
  between them.</p>
  <p>4th Int. State the character of the Deceased?</br>
  Ans. I never heard of his getting into difficulties. I considered him a good
  and quiet citizen.</p>
  <p>Crop Examination</br>
  1st Int. To whom was this remark made of Howell's about killing Coffey
  addressed?</br>
  Ans. To Coffey himself.</p>
  <p>2nd Int. At the time Howell made this remark was he raising his pistol to
  shoot?</br>
  Ans. He was getting it ready. The shot was made immediately, not over five (5)
  seconds after. There was no time for any one to interfere before this shot.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. How long have you known the prisoner?</br>
  Ans. Twenty-five (25) or thirty (30) years.</p>
  <p>4th Int. State his reputation as a citizen prior to this occurrence.</br>
  Ans. I never heard anything against the Prisoner's character as a quiet,
  unoffending citizen before this.</p>
  <p>The case was here continued until October 20th 1864. On application of
  Judge Advocate in order to obtain witnesses for the prosecution and also for

  <p>Mrs. Williams was then introduced as a witness on the part of the Defense

  <p>1st Int. State your name and residence?</br>
  Ans. Elizabeth Williams. I live in Maury County Tenn.</p>

  you known him?</br>
  Ans. I lived about a mile of him. I knew him thirteen (13) years.</p>
  <p>4th Int. What was the reputation and character of said Coffey a citizen?</br>

  violence against the Union people of your neighborhood? If so, what?</p>
  <p>Ans. Yes. I have seen him go about the Union people's houses searching

  was present. It was in last March. I don't know how many were with him. It was
  in the night; three or four were inside the house and I don't know how many
  outside. Coffey stood at the door with the pistol in his hand while they were
  searching. All those I saw were armed. Some had guns and some had pistols. I
  don't know what they took away. They threatened to kill Mr. Morrow (Accused)
  if he ever came home. I heard Mr. Coffey make these threats. They also
  threatened to kill my uncle Mr. Spencer. In consequence of these threats Mr.
  Spencer went away from here and remained away a year. Mr.Coffey did not give
  any reason for killing Accused as I heard of. He threatened my uncle, Mr.
  Spencer, and said he should not live there because my uncle was a Union man.
  He was armed when at Mr. Spencer's.</p>
  <p>6th Int. Are Mr. Morrow and the Accused Union men?</br>
  Ans. Yes, they are now and were at the time before mentioned.</p>
  <p>7th Int. Did you see Mr. Coffey often before he was killed? If so, was he

  Ans. Yes, sir. I saw him often. He was usually armed with his pistols. I saw
  him not over a week before he was killed. He was then armed.</p>
  <p>8th Int. Do you know whether Mr. Coffey was at any time connected with a
  guerrilla band or acted or acted as a guerilla?</br>
  Ans. He was. He acted as a guerrilla himself.</p>
  <p>9th Int. How recently had he been acting as a guerrilla?</br>
  Ans. I cannot say exactly. It was about a week or two before he was killed.</br>
  </br>
  </p>
  <p>Crop Examination:</br>
  1st Int. What did you know of his doing?</br>
  Ans. I did not see him do anything. I heard of it. I heard of his being at
  Mrs. Morrow's. She told me so herself.</br>
  </br>
  </p>
  <p>Question by the Accused</br>

  <p>Mrs. Coffey was next introduced as a witness on the part of the defense and
  after being duly sworn by the Judge Advocate in presence of the Accused, in
  answer to interrogatories through the Judge Advocate, testified as follows.</p>
  <p>1st Int. State your name and residence?</br>
  Ans. Catherine Coffey. I live in Giles County, Tennessee, about four (4) miles
  from where Mr. Coffey used to live. I knew Mr. Coffee, have known him about
  year.</br>
  I am related to Mr. Coffey by marriage. I married his cousin.</p>
  <p>2nd Int. What was the reputation and character of Mr. Coffey as a citizen?</br>
  Ans. He was considered a guerilla in the neighborhood; he was considered a
  guerrilla up to the time of his death.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. Did you know of his committing any depredations against the Union
  people of your neighborhood or of his making any threats against them?</br>
  </p>
  <p>Ans. I have. I have known of him going to Union people's houses and robbing
  and taking their things. It was along this summer. I can't tell the month it
  was in he robbed Morrow's house. I don't know positively that he took anything
  from Mrs. Hickman's. The first time I saw him with a band of guerillas was
  about three (3) weeks before last Christmas. He then was with twenty-five (25)
  men. The last time I saw him there was about a month before he was killed. He
  had thirteen (13) men there. The last time I saw him with the band he said he
  was hunting horses for Col. Biffle. I understand Col. Biffle to be a Southern
  guerrilla.</p>
  <p>4th Int. Did you ever know of his making any threats against any Union
  person or persons in your neighborhood? If so what?</br>
  Ans. I have heard him make threats against the Accused. This was about two
  weeks before Coffee was killed. He said he &quot;longed&quot; to kill him if
  he could ever catch him at home, that Morrow should never come there to live,
  for he had gone to the damned Yankees. He tried to have me to let him know
  when Mr. Morrow, the Accused, came out home. He said he would give me fifty
  (50) dollars to let him know. This was in Screamerville. I have heard him
  threaten Mr. Howell too. I never told. I never told Mr. Morrow of this threat
  for I never saw him after that until this morning. I saw Mr. Coffey often. He
  was always around. I never told Mrs. Morrow of this.</p>
  <p>Crop Examination</br>
  1st Int. Did you ever tell this threat of Coffey's and his trying to bribe you
  to anybody?</br>
  Ans. No. I never did tell it to anybody. They told me that if I ever did that
  I wouldn't live and do well. Bill Coffey and his brother Ham Coffey was there.
  They were both of them armed.</p>
  <p></br>
  Mrs. Thomason was next introduced as a witness for the Defense and after being

  people?</br>
  Ans. I only know of his molesting Mrs. Morrow's house. He just went there and

  Ans. I have heard him make threats against Major Howell. He said he had
  waylaid the road many a time for him and that he was going to kill him on

  Federals. Howell was then in the Union army. Coffey had pistols when I saw
  him.</br>

  <p>2nd Int. Did you know Mr.Coffey?</br>
  Ans. I had known him all his life. He lived about three miles away from one.</p>
  <p>3rd Int. What was his reputation as a citizen?</br>
  Ans. He was always called an overbearing kind of man ever since he has been
  grown.</br>
  He has been since this war part of the time in the Southern army and the rest
  of the time guerrillaing about among his neighbors.</p>
  <p>4th Int. Do you know of his having committed depredations against Union
  people?</br>
  Ans. He came to my house once with the guerillas. This was about 9 o'clock at
  night bout a year ago. I asked him what they wanted. They came in and
  commenced searching the house. Coffey came in and went under my beds
  searching. They all had pistols. Three came in the house. I don't know how
  many were in the yard. They did not take anything away from my house. I asked
  Mr. Coffey if he was hunting men. Mr.Coffey said, &quot;No.&quot; They left me
  and went and robbed several Union men of their salt that same night. That was
  the report. That same night they hung James Johnson. Mr. Coffey held Mrs.
  Johnson in the house while the rest of them hung Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson and
  his wife both told me about it the next day. They took him (Johnson) down
  before he was dead. I saw him next day. He came to my house next day. His face
  and neck and head were swelled up so he could hardly talk He told me what was
  the matter. Since my son went into the Union army Wm Coffey would not speak to
  me. I never heard Mr. Coffey threaten any Union people.</br>

  Judge Advocate</p>
  <p>The Court then proceeded with the trial of Sergt Samuel Morrow, 5th
  Tennessee Cavalry (Stokes), who was with the Counsel present in Court.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Mr. Thomason was then introduced as a witness on the part of the
  Prosecution and after being duly sworn by the Judge Advocate in the presence
  of the Accused, in answer to interrogatories by the Judge Advocate, testified
  as follows</br>
  </p>
  <p>1st Int. State your name and residence?</br>
  Ans. J.C. Thompson. I reside in Maury County, Tennessee.</br>
  </p>
  <p>2nd Int. Do you know the Accused and did you know the Deceased, Mr. Coffee?</br>
  Ans. I did.</br>
  </p>
  <p>3rd Int. State what you know of a quarrel or difficulty existing between
  the Accused and Mr. Coffee previous to the decease of Mr. Coffee?</br>
  </p>
  <p>Ans. The first I knew of it was last fall or winter I was staying at
  Columbia. Mr. Morrow came in there with a small squad of soldiers. Mr. Morrow
  (Accused) said that Bill Coffey had run him (Morrow) away from home and that
  if he came across him he (Accused) would slay him. I went with the squad. They
  were going out to the neighborhood of the Accused and myself. I went with
  them. We had got between two and three miles from town when we stopped to
  feed. I saw a bunch of Federals come up the road. They were under the command
  of Colonel Mizner, 14th Michigan,* who at that time commanded the Post at
  Columbia. The Colonel asked who commanded the squad. Sergt. Montgomery
  answered that he did. Colonel Mizner then said to Montgomery not to molest any
  citizens, especially the Coffey boys (meaning Wm and Hamilton Coffey), as he
  was &quot;not done with them yet.&quot; The Colonel then left. I went to Mr.
  Morrow's (Accused) and I then went to Green Coffey's and stayed. I then went
  back to Columbia the same night.</br>
  </p>
  <p>4th Int. State what conversation you had with the Accused at his house
  about six weeks or thereabouts before Wm Coffey was killed, in regards to Mr.
  Coffey.</p>
  <p>Ans. I was at Mr. Morrow's house about that time. Jim Howell was there.
  Accused and I went to one side and talked awhile. We talked about Coffey.
  Accused asked me if I had heard Coffey make any threats against Accused. I
  replied that I had not. Accused then said he intended to slay Coffee if he
  ever got a chance. I said &quot;You'd better be careful as Coffey is a Mason
  and that goes a long ways.&quot; Accused said, &quot;You are right, for there
  is a Mason in my Company who gets drunk whenever he pleases and he is never
  punished.&quot;</br>
  </p>
  <p>5th Int. Did you not have a conversation with Accused about the same time
  as this in regard to Coffey? At Mr. Morrow's own house? If so, state what was
  said and also state what Mrs. Morrow (wife of the Accused) said to Accused in
  regards to the same thing.</p>
  <p>Ans. I was at Mr. Morrow's house the same night I met Colonel Mizner.
  Accused was saying what he intended to do to Coffey. Mrs. Morrow said to him,
  &quot;Bill Coffey has never been on your place since you have been gone as I
  know of. He has always treated me gentlemanly. There are those you ought to
  kill, but Bill Coffey has never treated me amiss.&quot; This was about a year
  ago. I don't think Accused found his mouth to reply.</br>
  </p>
  <p>6th Int. Have you since the killing of Mr. Coffey had any conversation with
  Accused about the killing? If so state when and where it was; state this
  conversation fully.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Ans. After the killing, shortly after, the Wheeler said, &quot;I met the
  Accused in Columbia. He asked me what was said about Coffey's death down
  there.&quot; I replied that I understood that Squire McClindry had taken down
  testimony about the killing. Accused said &quot;McClindry had better watch
  what he was doing,&quot; that the Accused had made his return up yonder
  &quot;to his command,&quot; that he had &quot;command of the squad that killed
  Coffee.&quot; and that he &quot;was promised another squad and then three or
  four would go up.&quot; This was about two or three weeks after the killing
  but a short time after.</br>
  </p>
  <p>7th Int. State whether or not during this war you have always been a Union
  man.</br>
  Ans. I have and always expect to be one so long as I live. I have had my house
  and everything I had burnt by the Rebels; my stock stolen. My family is now
  barefooted and bareheaded and living in a shanty in consequence. I have been
  driven away by the guerrillas twice and had to flee for my life. Mr. Morrow
  and myself have always been Union men and good friends.</br>
  </p>
  <p>8th Int. Did you live in Mr. Coffey's neighborhood? If so state what sort
  of man he was, whether he was a quiet citizen or not?</br>
  Ans. I lived in three miles of him. I think he was a quiet man. If he ever had
  connection with any guerrilla bands through my country, I never knew it. He
  never was along with any who pestered me. His reputation was fair as any
  man's. He came back from the Rebel army about a year ago or a little over and
  took the oath of allegiance. I heard him take the oath in Columbia.</br>
  </p>
  <p>The Accused objects to the questions for the reason that the best evidence
  should be addressed to establish the fact that the Law of Congress and the
  Order of the War Department specifies what shall be evidence of having taken
  the oath.</br>
  </p>
  <p>In reply Judge Advocate says that he only wishes to prove this oath taking
  incidentally as a circumstance to show the good conduct and peaceful
  law-abiding character of the Deceased since his return from the Rebel army.
  That the objection of the Accused would have force if the Oath was pleaded in
  Defense or Amnesty of Deceased for any offence for which he was on trial
  before this Court.</br>
  </p>
  <p>That Judge Advocate has a right to show this fact like any other fact that
  goes to make up the character and conduct of the Deceased by the evidence of a
  witness who saw and heard it.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Court was cleared for deliberation and after duly considering the objection
  of the Accused and the reply of the Judge Advocate, the Court overruled this
  objection.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Court opened. Accused, Counsel and witness called in, decision of the Court
  announced.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Judge Advocate then offered in evidence a printed certificate purporting to
  be issued by the Provost Martial, Columbia, certifying to the fact that Wm
  Coffey there appeared and took the of Oath of Allegiance to the United States.</br>
  </p>
  <p>Judge Advocate also offered to prove that the Captain Nixon whose name was
  signed to the Certificate was at the time Provost Martial at Columbia and that
  his signature to the Certificate was genuine. Accused did not object to the
  admission of the document as evidence. Judge Advocate then read Certificate,
  the original of which is hereto annexed. Marked Exhibit &quot;B&quot; and made
  a part of this Record.</br>
