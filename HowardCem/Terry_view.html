GRAVE-ENTERPRISE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

<b>This view of the Terry
Grave shows many rocks scattered. I am unaware of the meaning of this one. The
practice of covering graves with rocks might have been in place here and vandals
and/or nature scattered them or there might have been an attempt to build a rock
fence around this graveyard at one time. I do not see any evidence that any of
the field stones were stood on end and buried in a manner so they would stand up
that way. This was a typical way of marking a grave when a formal marker was not
used. We are looking west across the burial ground at the foot and head stone.
Behind us about 300 yards is Enterprise Road spanning north to south or vice
versa. About 600 yards north or to our right is the Howard Cemetery and old
place fallen into decay known today as the Allie Kittrell home. My feelings are
that this place was first owned and developed by the Howard family as early as
the 1840s. That information needs more supporting evidence though to stand for
the history records. I noticed that the boarding has peeled away in spots
revealing logs and a foundation of fieldstone indicating an age prior to saw
milling. There is also a home to our left about 400 yards which might be old
enough to figure into the history of this graveyard, and is probably at least a
hundred to one hundred and twenty years old. <i>Photo &amp; info by
