  DUGGER, Twin Infants, of Roy &amp; Audrey (Matthews) Dugger, born &amp; died in the

  Rick Gray 30 Nov 2010:</br>
&nbsp;Wayne the twins you have listed as Douglas were actually Dugger twins. 
  They were the twins of my cousin Roy Dugger and his wife Audrey Matthews. I 
  will see if I can find the exact dates, but they were both born in 1940. One 
  was a boy who lived 3 hours and the other was a girl who lived 3 days. [R.G.]</br>
