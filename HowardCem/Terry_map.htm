<b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This is a topographical
map of the location showing the Terry
Grave. Enterprise Road spans north to south here.&nbsp; About 600 yards north of the
Terry Grave is the Howard Cemetery and an old
place known today as the Allie Kittrell farm. My feelings are
that this place was first owned and developed by the Howard family as early as
the 1840s. Though that information needs more supporting evidence
to stand for
the history records. I noticed that the boarding has peeled away in spots
revealing logs and a foundation of fieldstone indicating an age prior to saw
milling and the graveyard back of the house has death dates as early as the
1840s. There is also a home south of the Terry Grave about 400 yards which might be old
enough to figure into the history of this graveyard, and is probably at least a
hundred to one hundred and twenty years old. <i>Photo &amp; info by

</i>This aerial view of the Terry Grave and Howard Cemetery clearly shows the
places to find these old cemeteries. I am told by one good authority that Mrs.
Harris owns the place today and would be the contact for permissions. <i> <br>
