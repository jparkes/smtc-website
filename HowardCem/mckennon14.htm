  </i>Mrs. Fannie Nelson McKennon, wife of Mr. G. N. McKennon, Jr., died last
  Friday at her home near Enterprise, after several days suffering from lockjaw.
  The funeral services were conducted Sunday by Rev. W. D. Wendel, pastor of the
  South Columbia Methodist Church, of which congregation she was a member, and
  the remains were interred at Enterprise. Mrs. McKennon was a daughter of the
  late Judge Webb Nelson, and at the time of her death was 27 years of age. She
  leaves surviving her a husband and one child, a mother and several brothers
  and sisters. She was a pure Christian woman, loved and esteemed by everyone.
  To the bereaved family the deepest sympathy is extended. The Columbia Herald,
  Friday, Feb. 25, 1898, page 2. <i> <br>
