Mr. Austin, I want to thank you for the report on the Terry grave. Nancy would 
be my gr, gr, gr, gr grandmother.</br>
The information I have on the family tree finds them still living in North 
Carolina in 1820 census.&nbsp; According to family tree David (husband of Nancy) 
was born in Warren Co. N.C. in the year of our Lord,1785. My information says David Terry died in Maury County,Tn 
in 1834. I haven't found them in the Tn. Census yet. They had a son named David 
which is my lineage. I have found that he (David Jr.) married Catherine Lavender in 
Williamson Co. Tn. 1835 and he died sometime between 1856 and 1860. I don't know 
where they are buried, maybe here in this graveyard - (same place as 
Nancy) which I just found.</br>
I will be going to Maury County Tennessee sometime this (2010) fall to do research on 
the Terrys', hopefully I can verify my information and also I want to visit the 
Terry grave. Thanks,</br>
Melba Francis</br>
