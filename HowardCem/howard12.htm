  <b>HOWARD, Francis T. 'Tennie',
  29 Aug 1859 - 28 Aug 1890. (Daughter of Joseph David &amp; Nancy Isabel (Brownlow)
  Howard.) Poetic Inscription: &quot;A precious one from us has gone, A voice we
  loved is stilled, A place is vacant in our home, Which can never be filled,
  God in his wisdom has called the boon his love had given, And though the body
  smoulders here, The soul is safe in heaven.&quot; <i>Photo &amp; info by Wayne Austin

  This is the rest of the above stone which is the broken base. This stone will
  never stand again without a back support.</i></font></p>
