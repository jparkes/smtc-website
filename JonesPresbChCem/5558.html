PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CEMETERY, ISOM, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

  The tree in this photo has invaded the grave of Cyntha Bingham and dislodged
  her headstone. Notice the two footstones, one is for Cyntha Bingham (on our
  right) and the other one for Thomas Bingham behind the small sapling. Further
  out around the tree both headstones have been dislocated from facing their
  footstones in a normal fashion. Here one can get a feel for just how invasive
  trees can be when they spring up in the wrong place in a cemetery. This tree
  should be cut and the head stones reset as these are probable first Maury
  County Progenitors for the Bingham surname.<br/>
