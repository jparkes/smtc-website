  The John Wiley memorial beside a fieldstone marking a grave on the north side 
	of his memorial in the same row. There are also
  other fieldstones on the other side of this memorial.</br>

  Here is the other side as mentioned above and we see fieldstones there also
  but not standing as clearly as on the other side. All the fallen trees may have
  somewhat smashed the evidence here.</br>

  WILEY, John, 1 Mar 1781 - 24 Feb 1857 (Son of Robert &amp; Sarah (?) Wiley.)</br>
  WILEY, Mary W., abt. 1795 - death date unknown. married to John Wiley abt. 
	1815) There are two field stones one on either side of the John Wiley 
	memorial. Chances are very great one of them belongs to his wife Mary W. (?) 
	Wiley)</br>
	<i>I trace my ancestry to James Hugh Wiley/(Wylie) the early Wileys of Maury 
	County and still have not placed James Hugh Wiley in the genealogy charts 
	with this family though it is highly likely he is related. James Hugh Wiley is the
  oldest ancestor I have proven, b. 1822,&nbsp; Mecklenburg NC, d. Huckaby, TX, 
	1906.</br>
  This John Wiley fits well to be in the generation preceding James but I do not
  have the information to connect this. I recall in early records brothers Moses and
  other Wiley kin mentioned but I am careful with the old records as they are
  often inaccurate.&nbsp;</br>
