  WILEY/(WYLIE), Richard H. B., 24 Jul 1829 - 3 Aug 1829, aged 11 Days.
  &quot;Son of Jno &amp; M.W. Wylie(s). (Located in the Wiley/Fariss family
  Areas. Inscription: &quot;TO THE -- MEMORY -- of -- RICHARD H.B. WYL -- IE SON
  OF JNO &amp; -- M.W. WYLIE S. -- was bone the 24 of july 1829. aged -- 11
  days. &amp; died the 3 of august. 1829.&quot;&nbsp;</br>
  The Fariss &amp; Wiley families co-mingled their graves and memorials in this
  area of the cemetery.)</br>
  I am listing this surname as above. If anyone can remotely disconnect this
  child from the John Wiley buried a&nbsp; few graves to the south then I will
  happily change that back to the spelling Wylie.</br>
  Stone is leaning badly and it is difficult to see &amp; photograph the
  inscription. Since it is buried about 4 feet into the ground one cannot
  straighten it up without a major excavation effort.</br>
