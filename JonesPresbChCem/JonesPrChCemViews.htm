  We see just the top of the Evans memorial here. This is the typical abandoned
  cemetery look with the brush and limbs everywhere. Trees constantly die and
  shed limbs to fall all around.&nbsp;<br>
  <img border="0" src="vIMG_5513.JPG" width="668" height="502"><br>
  </i>On the back side of the cemetery there are few marked memorials. There are
  many fieldstones marking graves but they are hard to spot with the dense
  foliage all around. This cemetery is about 4 acres sprawling over a forest.<br>

  Another view looking east on the backside of the cemetery.<br>

  </i>Above is seen a grouping of rocks. There are many of these in this cemetery.
  They piled up rocks from the nearby pastures to be used to mark graves, cover graves to
  keep the groundhogs from digging and also to build rock fences. There was
  also at one time a Presbyterian Church on this premises that had a rock foundation.<br>

  This is one of many such enclosed fences within this cemetery. Families were
  selecting plots and laying out these separate areas which did gives one the
  impression there are several small cemeteries inside a large area.&nbsp;<br>
