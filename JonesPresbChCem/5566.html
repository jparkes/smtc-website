</i>LUSK, Samuel, 1737 - 8 Feb 1820. (b. Lancaster Co., Pa, d. Hampshire, Maury
  Co., Tn.; Son of James &amp; Elizabeth Lusk; husband of Margaret Lusk; one of
  Maury County's oldest pioneers.)<br/>
  This crumbling old stone is no longer readable. Mr. Fred and Evelyn I hope
  you'all got it right in 1967 &amp; 1987 respectably. However, we can make out:
  IN -- Memory of -- SAMUEL LUSK -- who died feb. -- the _ _ _ _ _ 8 0(for
  1820?) aged _ _ _ ?" I suppose they calculated the birth year date 1737
  from the age of 83 that was readable at one time. This old stone is about as
  soft as a piece of hard bread and water will do it in eventually.<br/>
