  NOLES, William, 4 Dec 1825 - 19 Aug 1875. Mason.<br/>
  There were many men of this age that died around this time from guerilla warfare.
  Bad feelings and policies of the Reconstruction era were responsible
  irrespective of the fact that the Civil War had ceased ten year earlier the
  killing did not stop. I am unaware if William Noles was one of those, but he
  was a Mason somewhat of a hint of evidence.Â <br/>
