&nbsp;A red check is placed on the Jones Presbyterian Church Cemetery. Other cemeteries that are on this map are the Worley Cemetery
otherwise known as the Whiteside Cemetery 500 yards west of here; the Kittrell
Family Cemetery north of this one 50 yards and at the top of the map the Kittrell
Cemetery aka Catheys Creek Church of Christ Cemetery. Catheys Creek Church
of Christ can be seen just south of and on the other side of the road from the
Kittrell Cemetery.&nbsp;</br>

From Columbia traveling Hampshire Pike go about 10 miles and veer right off of Hampshire Pike onto Taylor Store
Road. After
3/4 mile turn left on
Catheys Creek Road. When that road bends sharply right (or north) then turn left
into the Worley &amp; Jones Cemetery Gravel Roads. <i>This happens to be the old
community of Isom.</i>  Next follow the left fork of the road (marked Jones Cemetery) up the hill toward the farm house (private property). The cemetery is on
your right (but cannot be seen yet) on the same hill as the small Kittrell
Family Cemetery. The Jones Cemetery is further out on the hilltop under the forest. This cemetery
has several smaller family enclosure fences within a larger cattle fence
some of them old decorative wrought iron. The cemetery sprawls around the top of
the hill over several acres. At first you will find yourself on
the other side of a very secure fence with no gate to get into the Jones Cemetery
but next to the tall Kittrell Family Cemetery Rock wall. If you are not adept
enough to mount the solid rock wall of the Kittrell Cemetery to cross over into the
other side of the fence to get to the Jones Cemetery you should consider an
alternative route. That is going south up the fence line 300 yards (also tree
lined) from the road into the Worley Cemetery.
Look at the map above at the Worley Cemetery Road to understand what I am
saying. That is also private property heavily farmed in cattle and you will also
need permission there. That route may be the original road bed to the old church
that once stood there in front (north) with the cemetery in back (to the south)
of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i></br>
