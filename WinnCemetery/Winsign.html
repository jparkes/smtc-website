<p align="center"><b> </b>Note:
A recent restoration was done on this cemetery by the above folks. My findings
are that they did a great job including a fence that keeps out the livestock.
Nice winter grasses abound also. All stones are upright to the best of everyone's
ability. Now we know the full names of A. W &amp; Sussanna Winn. <i><br/>
This is an example of kinfolks that took charge and made a difference.</i><br/>
