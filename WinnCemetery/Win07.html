WINN, Andrew Alonzo, inf. of John R. (no other info discernable).<br/>
 Memorial is crumbling into tiny bits. We can read this much:
"SACRED", "drew". <br/>
I believe the "drew" is the lettering in Andrew. Thanks for the
Authors of T.P.T.W. &amp;  M.C.T.C.'s Fred Hawkins for preserving this much
of this lost memorial back in 1963 &amp; 1987 respectively. This stone might
still be readable by collecting all the bits of stone and reassembling the the
top plate for those pieces that have inscription on them. That is at least a 10 hour job
that I do not wish to tackle. There is a fresh fracture on the top that has
occurred this year. Just flaking off in the center. It does not contain any
inscription.<b><i><br/>
