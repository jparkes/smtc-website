Winn), 23 Nov 1821
-29 Oct 1905. (Daughter of A. W. &amp; Susanna Winn; mar. 1st, John A. Thompson 
(interred in McCain's Cem),
10 Aug 1852, &amp; 2nd, Silas D. Thompson, 13 Dec 1870.)<br>
&nbsp;</font><b><font size="2">Mr Hawkins, has added her as the daughter of Rev 
Geo. W. Winn. I [Trish Brewer Boone] believe she is the daughter of Archelaeus W. 
and Susanna Winn who are also buried here. <br>
On the 1850 census, which is the only one on which she would have been 
enumerated, by name, before she married John A Thompson, she is in the household 
of A W Winn and wife Susanna she is 27 yrs A W is 65 and wife is 61 making them 
38 and 34 respectively at the time of her birth, so, not too old to be her 
parents and there in no George, Rev or otherwise anywhere to be found.<br>
I [C Wayne Austin] agree chances are she is the daughter of A.W. &amp; Susanna Winn, 
however we know life is complicated. In other words the Rev George W. Winn may 
be her father and for example he and wife died and she was adopted by A.W. &amp; 
Susanna Winn. However since we don't have evidence of that I would go with her 
being the dau of A.W. &amp; Susanna. [C.W.A. 24 Nov 2013]</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"><br>
