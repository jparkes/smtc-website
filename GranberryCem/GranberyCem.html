CEMETERY,  HAMPSHIRE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE
</b></p>
<p>From Mt. Pleasant, take Hampshire Pike. Just beyond the By-pass, enter
farm lane that goes north go by the old barn and by the turn off to a new house
and the cemetery was supposed to somewhee near that field on the left.  I
could not find this cemetery in 2008.  It was located on USGS maps in the
middle of a green field with no visible sign of a cemetery around. <a href="GranberyCemMaps.html"> Locator Maps</a>

Mr Fred in 1987 said this; "The cemetery is in middle of bean field behind house.
The place was owned by Columbia Rock Products Co. and farmed by Jack Logue in
1988." <br/>

Commentary by Fred Hawkins 26 Feb 1987. "This cemetery is enclosed in a wrought iron fence and the gate is now grown into
the trees growing in the small plot. I had to climb over fence and wade through the
bushes to even get to the stones. Then, I had to dig most of them out of the
ground in order to read the inscriptions. Note that this is another case of
several persons in one family having died within a relatively short period of
time." <br/>
