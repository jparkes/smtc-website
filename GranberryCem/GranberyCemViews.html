Looking northwest. The map according to what I see shows the cemetery in that
field just in front of us but as you can see there is nothing there. Stay tuned
for updates as we determine the answer to this puzzle. </br>

This westerly view just shows there are no clumps of trees in this field. </br>

This is looking north down the farm lane where the cemetery was supposed to be
located on the left of the road up nearer the old rotting house barely visible
in the distant tree line.</br>
