From Mt. Pleasant, take (Hwy 166) toward Hampshire. Just beyond the By-pass, enter
farm lane that goes north go by an old barn and by a turn off to a new house.
The cemetery was supposed to be somewhere near that field on the left.&nbsp; I could
not find it in 2008.&nbsp; It was located on USGS maps in the middle of a green
field with no visible sign of a cemetery. </br>

This 2006 map shows a small clump of trees consistent with what Fred
Hawkins and the maps show. Today there was only a spot where nothing was growing
and it was freshly tilled.</br>
