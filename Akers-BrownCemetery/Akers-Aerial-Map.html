</b>This is an aerial
view of the area where I believe the cemetery to be. The black arrow points to
the spot. However, I have not visited
there to prove this correct.Â  It is very remote and will be hard to reach
being nearly 800 yards from the nearest road. The margin of error in the pointer
may be as much as 100 yards radius from the tip of the black pointer assuming
the USGS Longitude and Latitude are correct. If you visit this spot looking for
this cemetery do so in Feb or March when the vegetation is dormant for the
winter. Also get permission from the land owner. Nearby roads are Valley Creek
Road and Tanyard Hollow Road going south on our left. Pullen Mill Road is on our
far right of the map. Map extracted from the MSN Virtual Map site modified here
to depict this remote and endangered cemetery. <i>by Wayne Austin 8/12/2005. I
believe this is a 1997 aerial view.</i>
