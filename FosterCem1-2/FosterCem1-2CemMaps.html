two cemeteries were located on this Topomap using the Lat &amp; Long coordinates
supplied by someone to USGS. I searched the top red check for Foster Cemetery #2 area
thoroughly and was unable to locate the cemetery. This
map therefore has an incorrect GPS marking for that cemetery. I went back a second time
armed with a better understanding of Fred Hawkin's instructions of 1987 to find
Foster Cemetery #2 and was (lucky) successful. I found the cemetery across the
road and back up onto a forest behind two old barns and an old house on 27 Jan
2009. </b></center>

This is a corrected depiction of the Foster Cemetery #1 &amp; Foster Cemetery
#2. Foster Cem #1 is correct on GPS mapping but now the above + depicted with
the #2 is the spot where this Foster Cemetery #2 can be found up the slope in
the woods. No pines exist there anymore. The corrected GPS is on or about
35.66036 degrees north X 87.211311 degrees west. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Turns
out I found the cemetery with all the correct mentioned locator particulars in
place. However the large pine trees were dead and fallen onto the graveyard creating
problems. This brings up a point. Never use Pine Trees to mark the spot for
cemeteries. Their lives are too short at most about 80 years for their life
cycle. The Hardwoods spring up around them and choke them out in the south
Tennessee Hills where they are not native.</span><img border="0" height="496" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/FosterCem1-2/Foster2AerialMap.jpg" width="726"/>

map shows what you will see as you approach Foster Cemetery #1 on your left upon
the bank of the road just past a house. As you approach there Â  The cemetery is about 30 yards
from the Poplar Creek Rd. The Foster Cemetery #1 is easily found as located upon
the east bank beside the road just south of the drive of that house next door.
With this aerial map I have placed yellow pointers showing the various assets
that one can see today along the path toward looking for Foster Cemetery #2.
After viewing Foster Cem #1 go south a few hundred yards &amp; turn right off of
Popular Creek Road into the private drive. When the road bends at the gate park
and walk up the drive about 50 yards &amp; bear to the right of the old house
toward the two barns. Go just to the left of the first barn which is falling
down and then bend right to go around the right side of the second barn.
Continue up the slope thru the open area bending right until the tree line takes
over and there you will notice the old road bed. Follow the old road bed another
50 yards and the scattered little stones will be on your left spaced about the
forest. March is the best time to find this graveyard. The leaves are decayed and mashed down and the
vegetation is dormant. The whole distance back
into there is not more than 200 yards.<br/>
