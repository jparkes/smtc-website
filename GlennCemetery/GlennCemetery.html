Lockbridge, Clifford, 15 Apr 1881 - 31 Dec 1910<br/>
 _________, Gideon, died _______, 1940 (Fred Hawkins records this to be an
undertakers marker that was badly damaged at the time of his visit.) <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Hawkins records this to have a been a very large graveyard at one time. He
noted at least 20 fieldstones and other graves marked by cavities in the ground.
He noted on 27 Mar 1986 that it was completely hidden in a grove of trees. The
two burials noted above are the only graves he found marked with something other
than a fieldstone.</b>

</b><b>This map
  has the Glenn Cemetery on it somewhere. However I have not a clue where that
  is since the instructions Mr. Hawkins gives clash <br/>
  with this map. Also this cemetery is not listed on any cemetery map source and
  needs to be found and listed before it is destroyed. That road turning left at
  Lees Corner is the Will Brown road according to my map sources and it is
  hardly a mile long.<br/>
