War of 1812, Capt. Bird S. Hurt's Co. and was born in Virginia.) <br/>

<br/>
According to Fred L. Hawkins of "Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries" there is a marriage record
for Jane and Nicholas <br/>
Rice in Maury County records. Nicholas and Jane also appear in the 1850 Federal
Census.<br/>
Nicholas was also known to have served as a Soldier of the War of 1812.<i> </i>
We are unaware of the relationship of Nicholas &amp; Jane Rice to James Warden. 
Could Jane Rice have been a Warden or a more likely a sister to Mary (maiden 
name unknown) Warden?<br/>
