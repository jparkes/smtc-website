</br>
According to Fred L. Hawkins of &quot;Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries&quot; there is a marriage record
for Jane and Nicholas </br>
Rice in Maury County records. Nicholas and Jane also appear in the 1850 Federal
Census.</br>
Nicholas was also known to have served as a Soldier of the War of 1812.<i> </i>
We are unaware of the relationship of Nicholas &amp; Jane Rice to James Warden. 
Could Jane Rice have been a Warden or a more likely a sister to Mary (maiden 
name unknown) Warden?</br>
