<p align="center"><b>WARDEN, James Born June 2 1775 &amp; Died February 27, 1832 He was found as a
tax payer <br/>
in the 1810 reconstructed Census. When this 1990 photo was taken trees
threatened the stone, <br/>
but have since fallen or been cut away. It is believed by some that James wife Mary was
interred <br/>
here in an unmarked grave. However some believe that she was interred in the
Shane Cemetery <br/>
in what is now an unmarked grave or the grave is marked with eroded memorial no longer
readable. <i><br/>
This is a 1990 photo by Wayne Austin</i>.</b></p>

</i>Footstone on the east side of his grave of James Warden initialed as: "J.W. 
being helt up by Nick Boone."
<br/>
This foot stone has been damaged by the large trees you see here. When I first 
visited this cemetery in 1990 this stone was standing. There were no trees 
standing here at the foot of James' grave then. There was one by James's 
headstone and it was a small Maple that died or was cut.</b><b><i><br/>
