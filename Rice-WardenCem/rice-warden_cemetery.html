WARDEN, Mary, birth abt 1882 - death believed to be 1857, born in Pennsylvania,
wife of James Warden who was born 2 Jun 1775. Mary was living during the 1850 census 
with her widowed daughter Priscilla &amp; her son Joseph J. Kerr. </b><b> It is 
now believed
by some including the investigative work of C. Wayne Austin that James' wife Mary is
interred
in the Shane Cemetery beside John N. Warden, b. 1823, a younger son. </b><b>
She is buried in the Shane Cemetery under a crumbled headstone that
predates to the 1850s. Fred Hawkins found a year date of 1857 before the stone 
fell into complete disintegration. <a href="../ShaneCem/wardenunknown1.htm">Mary 
Warden -wife of James - listed in Shane Cemetery.</a></br>
</br>
These
graves are located high above Martin Hollow Road in a clump of bushy trees on
one's right, going south, about 3/4 miles from the intersection. Author Fred Hawkins
believes there were many more graves here at one time. He states that he can
clearly see the outline of one adult and one infant unmarked
grave.&nbsp;See page 520 &quot;Maury County Cemeteries&quot; for more history.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thought the name is inscribed incorrectly and should be RICE instead of RISE,
as given in both Maury Co. Marriage Book and 1850 Federal Census. I know of no 
one in Maury County history by the name of Rise. WA 2003.</br>
