<b>This map shows the GPS 
coordinates of the Rise-Warden Cemetery southeast of Campbell Station high upon 
hill. An easier GPS reading is the decimal one more widely used as given here: N 
35.43884 W -86.98464.</br>

&nbsp;From Campbell's Station take Martin Hollow Rd. south about 3/4
mile. The cemetery is on the right, high upon a hill in a grove of trees, behind
what was in 1987 the home of Mr. Charles Graff.</br>

I have the cemetery marked with a red check. It has been recently cleaned so 
this is an open spot in the woods today. Hopefully everyone will keep it that 
way.</br>
