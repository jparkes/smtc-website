CEMETERY (Snow Creek Rd.) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
</font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Crosby-HarrisCem/IMG_1426.JPG" width="674" height="507"><br>
After permission this is the locked gate that will confront you on your quest to
visit this cemetery. The cemetery is straight up that farm road in the clump of
trees in the distance of about 300 yards. The rock wall is not visible from this
photo due to fading imagery.&nbsp;<br>
The owner resides in the house (not seen here) to our right and it is a good
idea to get permission via the mail system or via phone first.&nbsp;<br>

</font><font size="2">This photo shows the large rock wall that encloses the
Harris memorials. There are memorials outside that wall somewhere and I presume
them to be on the west (far side or surely I would have seen them. The weeds
were so tall that day that a fallen stone would be difficult to find. This
cemetery should be visited in the winter time (preferably late winter) when the
tall grasses have been beat down by cold weather.<i><br>

</i>This photo from inside the rock wall shows the incredible amount of open
space inside the wall. The few memorials that are here are back up against the
south wall leaving about 1/4 acre open and questionable as to the use of the
spaces.<br>
