</i>This imagery is a not-so-realistic attempt at replication of the old
Crosby-Harris home as it might have appeared about 75 years ago or about the
first time it was painted white. The folks interred in this cemetery were
obviously prominent. This home has all the trappings of a home built prior to
1900 and may go back to pre-civil war days. All oak board siding before whitewash was left the natural
gray color of wood and actually endured well. White paint was called whitewash
in those days.</br>
