HARRIS, Hannah C., 29 Jan 1862 - 17 Jun 1904. "Wife
of M. M. Harris", "How desolate our house bereft of thee"<i><br/>
This stone was found face down on the ground. I stood it up against the bottom
of its base,
behind this part of the stone. It should stand there OK for
now. This stone was rendered out of balance by tree roots and eventually fell.
It is clear to me that a cemetery will disappear over time, on its own, without
maintenance to keep the stones standing. At least that is so with this type of
memorial.<br/>
