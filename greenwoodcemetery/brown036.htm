Co. Physicians, by William A. Smith, Columbia Herald - 23 May 1873: Probably no 
worthier name could be found for heading the list of Maury County physicians 
than that of the estimable Dr. Thomas Brown. He was born in Wilkes Co., near 
Wilkesboro, N.C. about the year 1784. Having been educated at the college in 
Greenville, Tn., he moved to Maury Co. about the year 1814. His medical studios 
were prosecuted in the medical department of the Pennyslvania University at 
Philadelphia and on coming to Tennessee he entered upon an extensive practice, 
which was continued for twenty years in this county, and was terminated only by 
his death. An exemplary man, and an excellent practitioner, his death occurred 
at about the age of fifty years. He died of cholera in 1834. Ref: e-mail from
