Mary &amp; William were possibly Black persons. The Davey Thomas memorial is leaning against this 
stone. I think he too was a Black person though Mr. Fred Hawkins did not indicate that in the book Maury 
County Tennessee Cemeteries. This stone is located in the area along the north wall. Photo and 
information by Wayne Austin 7/20/2003</i></b></pre>
