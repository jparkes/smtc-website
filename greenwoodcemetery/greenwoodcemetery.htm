<center><P><font color="#000080" size="2">Greenwood Cemetery is one of the oldest and
most historic Cemeteries in the southeast with many notable persons buried there
including the parents of the 11th President of the U.S.&nbsp; James K. Polk.
They are Major Samuel &amp; Jane Knox Polk. The Cemetery is four blocks north of
the Court House on the Nashville to Columbia Pike. The photography on this cemetery
was done by Wayne Austin as a quick Sunday afternoon project with a time limit.
Later as the cemetery underwent a renovation by the Columbia Parks &amp;
Recreation I went back and photographed more of the memorials but with no
intention of completely photographing the cemetery. Memorials were selected and
photographed at random as I toured the
Cemetery. I hope someday to completely photograph the cemetery when the
restoration is complete. Many of the box tombs still need repair to get them
back up to par if the parts can be located.&nbsp;<br>
Some of the large box tombs in the past appear to
have had vandals breaking them apart and scattering&nbsp; pieces around the cemetery.&nbsp;There
is also some damage to the stones from grounds maintenance workers banging the
lawnmowers or string trimmers into the stones at the base leaving large gouges
in the stones. The stones in this cemetery are old and very soft. That is unlike the hard Granite stones in
Rose Hill Cemetery down the street. These soft limestone memorials need extra care when mowing around the
premises. For more history see the book Maury County Tennessee by Fred L.
Hawkins.</font><P><b>
