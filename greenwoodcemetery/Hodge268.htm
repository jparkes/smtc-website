1789 - 10 Oct 1825. (s/o Joseph &amp; Euphemia Hodge.) Inscription that can be read:<i> 
&quot;JOHN HODGE was born the . . . . . . departed this life on . . . . . October 
1825&quot;</br>
&nbsp;</i></font></b><center>

His birth year needs to 
be changed to 1793. The family Bibe page says it is 1793. In addition, the year 
you have of 1789 does not work with his younger brother, Robert, being born in 
February 1790...that is just 9 </br>
months after John's birth...possible, but highly unlikely.<i></br>

Diane as a rule we on this site use the dates according to the tombstone 
because those 
can survive long after any paper records are gone. We do that unless we get 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary. There are two problems in applying this 
procedure in this case, (1) we don't have a (double checked) proven record of the 
tombstone (dates unreadable above and on findagrave.com) inscription nor (2) do we 
have that for the family Bible even though your presentation evidence is strong. In light 
of 
that contradiction I am staying with the original information which can be 
verified against a book as noted on this site. Also I can see a faint 
1789 in the graphic above. So the reader can make up their own mind, but I 
suppose if your doing genealogy you will use 1793.&nbsp; C.
