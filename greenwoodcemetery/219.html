<b>O'REILLY, James C., Jr., 29 Nov 1813 - 4 Jul 1856. 22-7-5.
Full Inscription: This Monument is erected to the memory of JAMES C. O,REILLY
JR. Born 29th November 1813 Died 4th July 1856 Aged 22 years 7 months &amp; 5
days. Those virtues which endear departed friends were conspicuous in the tenant
of this tomb. This interesting youth after thoughtless life was brought to know
God in the furnace of deep affliction and evinced an early maturity of Christian
principles by an unbonded love of amour sweet submission and immortal hope. He
conquered death and sleeps in Jesus. Blessed are the dead who died in the
Lord."<i><br/>
