A
view looking south east from the north wall. This is a very old and quite
historic cemetery with many if not most of the stones dating prior to the Civil
War in 1860. These stones are very traditional for the mid 1800s. Even New York
City in the heart of the Wall Street district has an old cemetery with stones
shaped similar to many of the above but they were made from a very different
type of stone material coming from quarries from mountainous areas of upstate
NY. Some or all of the stones seen in the front bottom area were the stones of
black persons. The immediate area is the black or slave section. <i>Photo &amp; information by WA. 7/20/2003</i></font></b><CENTER></center>
