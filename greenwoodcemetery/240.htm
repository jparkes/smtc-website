Elvira Nelson) 17 Jul 1819 - 29 Aug 1836, wife of Charles W. Old; daughter of
Pleasant Nelson and Elizabeth Cherry Nelson. (not listed in MCTC.)<br>
 OLD, Infant of C.W.
&amp; E. N., born about 1836, no dates given.<i><br>
The following text is from a Family Bible owned by Mary Belle Cross Duvivier of
New York a native of Columbia: Mrs. Charles Old is Nancy Elvira Nelson Old,
sister of Adeline E Walker (above) daughter of Pleasant Nelson and Elizabeth
Cherry Nelson. The Bible says she was born 17 JUL 1819 married 1 DEC 1835 and
died 29 AUG 1836 (about 9 months after she married, so my guess is that she died
in childbirth thus the infant being listed) The Bible entry says:<br>
&quot;Nancy Elvira Old departed this life August 29th 1836. She died in her
perfect senses, in the full assurance of eternal rest in the Kingdom of Heaven
among her last words she said “O Papa I am going to Jesus don’t weep after
me but try and meet me in heaven. O, I would talk more but I am so weak&quot;&nbsp;<br>
