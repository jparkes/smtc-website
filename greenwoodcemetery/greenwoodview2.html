CEMETERY COLUMBIA TENNESSEE</b><center><img border="0" height="600" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/greenwoodcemetery/greenwoodview2.jpg" width="800"/><b><br/>
Looking south at the southern area. The stones are actually arranged in crudely laid
out rows with the various families tending to cluster together. Not so noticeable
is the grouping by religious faith. Broken and
decaying stones abound. One always wonders where the missing parts of the stones
have gone since they are often missing from view. Vandals took some of them away in
some cases. In other cases they sunk just beneath the soil line after laying on
the ground for many years. If you know of any of these displaced stones please
contact your local historical society so they can be put back into the cemetery
where they belong. Most of the white spots on the ground are fallen memorials
that could be set back up with a little effort. However, they might be displaced
from the original grave site. Also some might be common rocks marking graves. Photo
