<pre align="center"><b>THOMAS, Davey, d. 3 Feb 1859. 60 years. "Davey Thomas, husband of Dinah Thomas died 
Feb 3, 1859. Age 60 years". Judging from the color of this stone I would say it has been uncovered 
from the ground in recent years. There is a listing for a David Thomas by Fred Hawkins with the same 
dating. Possible that the main stone is somewhere else with name David and this is a foot stone. It is now 
propped against the Codelia Polk Memorial. Previous researchers that I am aware of do not mention it but 
judging from who their burial neighbors were and the location in the cemetery that Davey and Dinah were a 
black couple. Anyone that is knowledgeable on this may write me and I will publish your thoughts here. <i>
