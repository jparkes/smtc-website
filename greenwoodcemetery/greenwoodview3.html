Looking at some of the box tombs in the cemetery. These are in very bad order
and need immediate attention. There is actually six box tombs in our view but
most of them are collapsed with broken sides and tops. Folks these were
prominent persons at one time in our country's early history maybe even
associating with the president of the US. Why do we allow this decay? While some
of this can occur naturally most of this damage was intentional infliction by those of
us without common decency being caused from the work of overactive vandals. Photo by WA. 7/20/2003<a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.html"><br/>
