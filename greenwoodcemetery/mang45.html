MANGREM, Littleberry, 16 Jul 1783 - 16 Feb 1837. (Isle of Wight Co. Va. native; s/o Briton and Elizabeth Glover; married Clara (Clary) Jordan in Greensville Co., Va. He came to Maury Co. with his uncle Henry Mangum. (Note: Dave Johnston, a descendant of this family states that Littleberry's dates appear to be on his wife's ts. Mr. Johnston say Littleberry enumerated in the 1840 census and the death date on Clara's tombstone is actually his death date.)<i>

Note by Wayne Austin: I think the Census 
tends to be less reliable information than tombstone dates, but everyone is 
entitled to their interpretation.This tombstone was set in 1837 or shortly 
thereafter so it is probably correct and the likelyhood of switching them 
between husband and wife who died at two diffeent times is pretty small. Well I 
just need to see more proof than the Census.&nbsp; WA. 3 Sep 2010.</font></i></b></pre></center></div><center><P><b><a HREF="../greenwoodcemetery/greenwoodlist.htm"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/greenwoodcemetery/../buttongr.jpg" </font width="300" height="50"></a>
