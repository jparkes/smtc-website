CEMETERY COLUMBIA TENNESSEE</b><center><img border="0" height="438" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/greenwoodcemetery/GreenwoodPhotos2005-11-29/IMG_8583view.JPG" width="586"/><b><br/>
Looking west at the cemetery from inside on 11/29/2005 finds the cemetery much
improved from recent restorations by Cumberland Research Group funded by the
Columbia Recreation and Parks Department from a grant. Much of the historical
value has been regained. The large wooden markers indicate graves found by the
Ground Penetrating Radar Equipment showing there is an unmarked grave there. We
see several in this photo though many of them are too small to be noticed in
from this photo. I recognize the stone of Arnold Zelner stone (front &amp;
center). Photo by WA. 11/29/2005<a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.html"><br/>
