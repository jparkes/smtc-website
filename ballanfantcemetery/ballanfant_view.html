&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Looking
northwest across the cemetery. The iron protective fence is going to need repair
to stand long term. The cattle have rubbed against it until it leans and is in
danger of falling. <i>By Wayne Austin 03/24/2004.</br>

This view is looking west across the rows of
memorials. There is serious cattle ranching going on around this cemetery so be
careful not to disturb the livestock if you visit here. The way to do that is to
move slowly and deliberately around them.</i></p>
