<b>This cemetery is
small but laid out in rows. The number to the
left of the listing represents the sequence of the photograph which denotes the
proximity of the graves except in cases where the photographer changed to the
next row. The photographer started on the southwest corner of the cemetery. Most
of the graves with markers were in the central part of the cemetery in row
#2&nbsp; &amp; one fallen memorial in row #3.&nbsp; Row #4 was not populated
with memorial stones but contained unmarked graves and/or graves marked only
with field stones or maybe unused plots. I make no distinction between unmarked
graves and unused plots, because the scope of my analysis does not encompass
that. The surrounding area near the rock fence was without marked stones and
represented about half of the cemetery.&nbsp; Except for the Ida Bailey memorial
the first row was not populated with memorial stones but contained unmarked
graves and 2 graves marked only with field stones or others areas of unused
plots. So tracking down the rows actually began on the second row going south
and really was largely concerned with that row.&nbsp; An attempt to photograph
the field stones was made early on by going around the outside and photographing
those.&nbsp;I estimate the size of the cemetery to be about 50 feet east to west
by 70 feet north to south.</b><CENTER>
