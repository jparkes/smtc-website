<b>This is a view of the
Fitzpatrick Cemetery from inside the rock wall. The memorials are labeled per
the inscription on the stone. Except for the Ida Bailey
memorial the first row was not populated with memorial stones but contained
unmarked graves and 2 graves marked only with field stones or others areas of
unused plots. Tracking down the rows from stone to stone actually began on the second row going
south and really was largely concerned with that row. An attempt to photograph
the field stones was made early on by going around the outside and photographing
those.&nbsp;I estimate the size of the cemetery to be about 50 feet east to west
by 70 feet north to south<i>. As you can see by the visible farm and nearby homes
a visit to this cemetery will need permission from nearby land owners and
special care not to disturb livestock. Photo &amp; info by
