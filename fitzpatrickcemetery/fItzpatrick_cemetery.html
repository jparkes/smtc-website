<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy">Fitzpatrick Cemetery may be found by taking the
Lewisburg Highway from Culleoka for 1/2 mile. The cemetery is on your right up
the slope in a grove of
trees about 100 yards behind two nice new brick homes on private land. It is
enclosed by a rock wall that is weak in a few places. One of the surrounding
landowners have set a wire fence over the rock wall in the low places to prevent
livestock from entering the cemetery. They are to be commended for the civic
minded efforts. </span></h1>
