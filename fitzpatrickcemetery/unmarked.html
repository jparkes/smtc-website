As one can see there
are at least nine fieldstones that look suspiciously like grave markers. It is
not proven that these mark graves. It is apparent for the ones that are in the
rows lined up with the marked headstones that they mark a grave as is the case
with many of the above stones. Field stones around the outside may mean slave
markers or they may be for neighbors that were not part of the family that were
given plots. They may also indicate a small child of the family. The other
possibility is that these mark graves in the early 1800s before headstones were
available. In some cases family members put down marked headstones years later
and in other cases there was no action taken leaving only the fieldstone. One
thing is clear. All of the above stones are not naturally occurring in the
position they are set now because the stones are clearly partly buried and stood
on their edge. Random fieldstone will lie flat on the ground unless they are
thick. All of the headstone markers found in this cemetery had carved footstones
placed at the foot of the graves.</b></center></center></center></center></center></center></center></center></center><b>
