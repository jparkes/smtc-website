</b><b>You will
notice that the name used here is the Jacob Cemetery. It is almost at the top of
the crest of a ridge. Following the Electrical Transmission line on the Topo map
northwest one can count 6 steel transmission towers north west
of where the Tom Fitzgerald Road crosses under the TVA Electrical Transmission
Lines. The cemetery sits under the 6th one but that tower will not be visible at
that place in the Tom
Fitzgerald Road due to the hill sloping downward on the other side.</b><b>
The closest point and better approach is to use Mr. Hawkins directions on the main menu but the
house owner is probably different today than in 1987.
