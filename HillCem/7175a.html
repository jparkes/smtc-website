<p align="center"><b>HILL CEMETERY,
HILL STATION (eastern), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
CHILDREY, Private 
Albert Childrey, cir 1841 - Apr 1863 <br/>
<br/>
The Youthful Albert Childrey lies here in the Hill Cemetery (Hill Station 
Community) in an unmarked grave. Childrey a confederate soldier was in the 
county in the spring of 1863 and as he was so near to his home he was given 
permission by his commanding officer to go visit his family.<br/>
While at home a Federal Spy in the neighborhood reported his presence to Federal 
Troops stationed at Hurricane Switch (now Glendale). They came after him, but he 
escaped toward the Duck River, swimming the river, although it was high and he 
made it to McCutchan Island. The Yanks shot him from a position on a bluff 
overlooking the river. After the shooting, the Federals then went by his home 
and told his wife, "We've shot your damned old husband, go get him."<br/>
