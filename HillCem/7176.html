HILL, unnamed infant
boy, 20 May 1842 - 3 Jun 1842.<br/>
The top of this stone was temporarily set upon the base for photography. I
always set the pieces back down with the inscription facing away from the other
part of the stone. That prevents the inscription from being gouged off by
friction.</b><b><br/>
