HILL STATION (eastern), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

Unknown, bottom without a top, inscription missing. Possibly for Nancy Jane Wear
or Peggie Hill.</br>
This stone is broken in half and the part with the inscription is missing. I did
not probe around for it so it may be in the soil nearby.</b><b></br>
