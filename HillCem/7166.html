The tall broken
memorial in the center of the rock wall. The Spire leaning on the memorial from
the right belongs to the large memorial base in the upper right of the photo.<br/>

</b><b>WEAR,
N.J., 25 Jul - 16 Sep 1851. "daughter of Rev. W.D. &amp; N.J. Wear."Â <br/>
Many characters are missing on this inscription. The memorial is splintering on
the right (our) side. The top has fallen and is separated from the base.<br/>
I believe this monument contains the inscription for Nancy Jane Wear the mother
of the baby also interred here. I looked for dual inscriptions but somehow
missed it or it is covered in debris.</b><b><br/>
