<font size="2">I am sending you the info as stated in &quot;A Historical Calendar&quot; 
from the Mt. Pleasant/Maury Co. Phospate Museum. The Stagecoach Inn was pictured 
as July Photo.<br>
This old Inn which was located on Lusk Road off the Southport Road past 
Porter's. This was the road from Mt. Pleasant to Bigbyville in the 1800's.<br>
The early Inn burned and was replaced by this brick building in 1842. It was 
built by James Giddens. Torn down in the 1990's, it had been lived in by several 
families after the Inn was closed.&quot;<br>
