<font size="2" color="#000080">The groundhogs have undermined this small 
fenced-in plot so badly that it is dangerous to walk around in it. Some of the 
monuments are in the process of being toppled into the holes. [19 Feb 1988 Fred 
L. Hawkins.]<br>
What I found&nbsp; in 2012 was the same groundhog damage. However three stones, the 
Carolina A. Giddens; William M. Giddens and the Eliza Harriett Ann Craig,&nbsp; 
were all broken and the top broken out. The upper part with the names were missing. We 
matched the dates with the name according to the way past researchers have found 
this cemetery but cannot guarantee the correctness of the inscription using that 
approach. [CWA 2 Apr 2013]<br>
<br>
James Giddens (the father? of the above James Monroe Giddens 1816-1894) was 
Capt. of 21st Reg. of Williamson Co. ,Tn Militia Commissioned on March 20, 1810 
according to Ancestry.com <br>
There is a picture of Stagecoach Inn @ the Mt Pleasant, Tennessee, history 
Museum. The location used to be in the clump of trees near Gidden's Cem. Mr. 
Woodard said his Uncle burned it down. So Sad. It would have made a great piece of 
history. Apparently James Gidden's Sister ran both the one at Thompson's Station 
and the one on Lusk Road. [Kathy Overstreet 28 Nov 2012]</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2">Francis Giddens was born April 1, 1753 in Virginia and died 
May 11, 1830 in Thompson's Station. He was the son of James and Margaret Giddens, 
Sr. He married Mary Pointdexter White on October 3, 1782 in Louisa County, 
Virginia. She was the daughter of Moses and Elizabeth Pointdexter White of 
Louisa County, Virginia. He served in the American Revolution (1775-1783). He 
applied to the government for pay due him for repairing a large number of public 
arms on Feburary 24, 1784 in Louisa County. <br>
<br>
The children of this couple were Elizabeth (1780-1832) who married Spencer 
Buford December 9, 1801; Sarah (born 1786), who married Charles Buford October 
27, 1804; Mary (1790-1853), who married James Buford, Jr. October 6, 1812; James 
(1784-1818) who married Priscilla Buford April 3, 1806; Nancy (1790-1851) who 
married Samuel Word; Francis, Jr. (1795-1829) who married Rachel Gilchrist; and 
Marcus (1800-1821). <br>
<br>
Francis and Mary Giddens sold their land in Virginia in 1800 and moved, with 
other family members, to the area now known as Thompson's Station. <br>
<br>
Shortly after arriving, Francis Giddens purchased land along Murfree's Fork. 
This creek, like Murfreesboro, was named after Colonel Hardy Murfree. It is one 
of the largest tributaries of the West Harpeth River, beginning in the vicinity 
of Thompson's Station. <br>
<br>
Also in the area at the time were three of Mary White Giddens siblings: Chapman 
White, William White and Mrs. Caleb (Nancy) Manley and their families. Giddens 
built a log house in which the family lived until their plantation house 
&quot;Homestead Manor&quot; was completed in 1819. The original house was replaced in 1870 
by Mrs. W. D. (Nannie) Lavender and now occupied by the Benson family. <br>
<br>
In 1819, Francis Giddens was granted a license as &quot;owner and proprietor and 
keeper of the mails&quot; of an &quot;ordinary&quot; or inn for $2,500 for the entertainment of 
man and beast south of Nashville. The place was called &quot;Giddens&quot;, or sometimes 
&quot;Stagecoach Inn&quot;, by travelers and drivers from the Ohio River to the Gulf of 
Mexico. Weary travelers could find good food, bedding and stables for their 
horses here. *<br>
<br>
Owners of this house, after Francis and Mary Giddens, were: their daughter, Mrs. 
Samuel (Nancy) Word; Mrs. Charles (Mary) Lyle, daughter of Nancy; Major James 
and Sophia Kernan Akin; Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jefferson Timmons; Mr. and Mrs. W. 
T. Naff, daughter and son-in-law of the Timmons; Mrs. Jim (Mary C.) Tanner and 
her sister Miss Winifred Hagerty; and, Mrs. Hazel Giddens Morton who sold to the 
Darbys. <br>
<br>
Dr. and Mrs. Darby have restored the house to its original splendor and added a 
modern kitchen wing to the back of the house. In 1974 they moved the old West 
Harpeth School house approximately 100 yards north of the manor house. This 
building was restored and serves as farm and professional office for the present 
owners. <br>
<br>
A cemetery on the back of the property is the &quot;burying ground&quot; for members of 
the Giddens family and extended family relatives. <br>
<br>
A complete description of the house and other interesting information is found 
in the Williamson County Historical Society Journal No. 15. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#008000">Note: Some confusion exist in this reported 
history as to where the Stage Coach Inn reported in two places above existed. 
Was it in Thompson's Station in Williamson County or east of Mt Pleasant in 
Maury County or were there two Stage Coach Inns run 1t by Frances Giddens then 
later in Maury County by James Giddens meaning different members of the Giddens family at different intervals. 
However instead maybe the Francis Giddens above actually founded the extinct 
Stage Coach Inn which was on Lusk Road in Maury County and that fact was lost in 
the history above. More research needed. [CWA 2013]<br>
