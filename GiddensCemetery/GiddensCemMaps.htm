From Mt Pleasant go east on Southport Road to Porters Chapel and continue after 
another 1/3 mile turn left on Lusk Rd and go about 1/2 mile and the cemetery is 
on the left. The cemetery is behind a garage on private property inside a chain 
link fence which sustained damage from falling tree limbs. It is marked on Maps 
as being another 1/2 mile up the hill on the left. So if you have USGS mapping 
ignore that. <br>

Mr. Fred Hawkins historical directions: From Porter's Chapel go out Scott's Hill 
Road for 1/4 mile; take Lusk Rd. to old brick house on William Kittrell place. 
The cemetery is behind house, enclosed by a chain-link fence.</font><font color="#000080"  size="2"><br>

With this another aerial view. This cemetery resides in the little clumps of 
trees behind that garage which sets at an angle, but please inform the owner of 
your intentions to visit this cemetery. <br>
