This is a window photo view
of Friendship Cemetery looking up the hill north east at section 1 or the older
section. Many open areas abound with field stones or unmarked graves. The
Bryant, Hill &amp; Fitzpatrick memorials inhabit the area up the hill near the
tree in the center. That area tends to be the oldest. Section one which is
now about full grew outward in all directions from the center. WA

</i></b>Panning to the right (more easterly) a bit we get another window photo
view of Friendship Cemetery. This is looking up the hill north east at section 1
or the older section. We can see in the corner a bit of the church in the
extreme right of the photo. As of this date I think I missed photographing and
therefore listing several stones in the right portion of this view.Â <br/>
I remember the one and only time I was able to accompany my dad (Paul Austin b.
1912, d. 2003) back in 1988 on a family history trip to Culleoka. He took me to
Wilkes - Campground and this cemetery. He knew many of the folks interred here
and many of them were at least distant cousins of his and of course mine.
Visiting this cemetery created a flood of childhood memories for him of the good
folk's whose remains lye beneath this soil. It was one of those precious moments of life
for both of us. With him being a native of Culleoka and having moved away to
Alabama in 1940 he walked around the cemetery and began to relate information
and stories of some of those persons he knew in his childhood. As we stroll
about there were also silent moments in his memory when he recalled a childhood
chum fallen early into death's grip, or a childhood friend's parent meeting an
untimely death.<br/>

It is in the oldest part of the cemetery looking back west to slightly north.
The big oak tree in the distance is in the northwest corner of Section 1.<i><b>

We are looking northwest into Section 1 from near the church parking lot.
The trees in the distance are in the northwest corner of Section 1. <br/>
