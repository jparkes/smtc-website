FRIENDSHIP BAPTIST CHURCH&nbsp;</br>
A brief History<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;" class="CharacterStyle1">Among
the very earliest settlers in Maury County were <span style="letter-spacing:.35pt">many
of the Primitive Baptist persuasion. Some of them </span>came into the valley
drained by Fountain Creek soon after Armstead Redding, himself a member of this
denomination, blazed the first trail into the area in 1807. He was soon followed
by others and, by 1810, a congregation had formed and a meetinghouse erected on
land donated by Jones Kendrick. This church was called: Fountain Creek Primitive
Baptist Church. Whites, free men of color and slaves worshipped together for
many years. It stood in a place just to the west of what is now Culleoka. The
only remains there today is an old nearby graveyard which includes the remains
of many of it members. <o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;" class="CharacterStyle1">What
caused the church to divide and move in the late 1820's or 1830's is not known.
Whatever the cause, Mr. John Toombs gave six acres of land to the congregation
in 1833 and soon thereafter a group of the white members built a <span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">meetinghouse
just east of where the Village of Culleoka soon began to take form. It took the
name Friendship Bap</span>tist Church, and, Elija Hanks, a renowned evangelist
of the epoch, became one of its first elders. By 1840, Hanks was preaching a
doctrine that differed from Primitive Baptist beliefs in several points and led
a number of area congre<span style="letter-spacing:.15pt">gations to change
their denomination. Friendship was one </span><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">of
the churches that helped form the Duck River Mission</span>ary Baptist
Association in 1845.<o:p>

<p align="center"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS" class="CharacterStyle1">The
name of the first occupant of a grave in the cemetery<i><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;
letter-spacing:.05pt"> </span></i><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;letter-spacing:

us. Possibly there were burials made prior to 1845 but this is the earliest date
recorded on inscribed stones. It <span style="letter-spacing: .15pt; mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">is
interesting that these stones are for five members of </span>the Edward T.
Bryant family, all of whom died within a few weeks of each other, from August to
November, 1845.</br>

</font><u>John Tombs</u> was
a son of Edmund and Sabra Tombs who immigrated from Virginia very early in the
history of Maury County. He was one of the first Baptists to settle in the area
around Culleoka and in 1833 gave six acres of land on the eastern edge of the
settlement for the building of a church and a cemetery. Soon after coming to
this county, John Tombs enlisted for service in the War of 1812. It was in that
year that he also married Miss Catherine Weems. To them were born: William W.;
Anthony M.; John H.; Mary A. Goad &amp; Nancy Hardin. Mr. Tombs passed away on 4
Mar 1875 and is buried here on this hillside near where his cabin once stood.
The name was spelled Tombs, Toomb, Toombs, and Tombs by various of the
descendents of John Tombs.</font></span></p>
