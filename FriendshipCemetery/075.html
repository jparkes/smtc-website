CHEATHAM, Frank, 2 Sep 1853 - 25 Dec 1929&nbsp;</br>
and</br>
CHEATHAM, Josie, 22 Jul 1862 - 23 Nov 1926, Section 1.</br>
The Frank Cheatham's lived on Covey Hollow Road on the McCains (east) side of
the hill in an old southern white house. Just down from the house was a spring
that gushed cold fresh water. The house was on the right (south) side of the road just
east (400 or so yards) from the intersection of Canterbury and Covey Hollow
Road. The old house was blown away by a killer tornado that swept thru there in
the 1970s or 1980s. Of course as you can see they did not reside there at that
time. [WA 10/11/06</br>
