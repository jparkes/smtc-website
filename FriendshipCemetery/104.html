Unknown stones, near the lower western section. There is a large open area with
many fieldstones marking graves near here. I did not photograph them but can
count several in the above photo. Might have been slave graves or not? During
the time prior to ending slavery the slaves and owners were interred in separate
sections of the same cemetery. I am unaware of the history or the layout respectful
of that information in this cemetery. Section 1 (Old section).<br/>
