Unknown upright stone crumbled with time, near the west central section. There
is a large open area with many fieldstones marking graves near here. Might have
been slave graves or not? During the time prior to ending slavery the slaves and
owners were interred in separate sections of the same cemetery. I am unaware of
the history of the layout respectful of that information in this cemetery.
