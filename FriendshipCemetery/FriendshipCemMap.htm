<font color="#000080" size="3" >To find this cemetery go
east from Culleoka Tennessee out Hwy 373 one mile and look up the hill to your
left and you will see the cemetery just west of the church. The white trails
above are the roads thru the different cemetery sections. Section one is the
oldest and Section two is next with the section three being opened up recently. Go there to enjoy the
beauty of the cemetery. Go there for mischievous reasons and you will be strung
up.&nbsp; The local caretakers and folks watch over this cemetery like they
should. I should know they were even suspicious of an out-of-towner like
me.&nbsp; WA 10/10/06<i><b><br>
