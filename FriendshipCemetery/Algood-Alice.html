BAPTIST CHURCH/CULLEOKA CEMETERY, CULLEOKA, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</br>
</font>ALGOOD, Alice Wright, 11 Mar 1926 - 16 Mar 2010. (This true Maury County native
and seventh generation Tennessean was devoted to her faith, her family, her
community, and her nation. Her youth was spent in Culleoka and Columbia, and
while her father, Aubrey Wright, taught at Columbia Military Academy, she began
what would become a life long love and commitment to the school. She was a
member of the Central High School Class of 1942, graduated at St. Agnes in
Memphis, and attended Louisiana State University.</br>
</font></br>
A Contralto with the Nashville Symphony at its inception, Mrs. Algood sang with
the symphony at the Ryman Auditorium and continued her joy in the art as a
member of the Columbia Choral Society, the choirs of Garden Street Presbyterian
Church, Zion Presbyterian Church, and First Presbyterian Church, where she met
her future husband, Reuben Algood. She also lent her time and talent to St.
Catherine Catholic Church and St. Peter�s Episcopal Church. Friendship Baptist
Church in Culleoka was built on land given by her ancestors and she retained her
membership there for many years.</br>
Her role in preservation throughout the nation, and specifically in Tennessee,
placed her in the role of President of the Association of Preservation of
Antiquities (APTA), President of the Tennessee State Museum Foundation, a member
of the Tennessee Historic Commission, and was currently Chairman of the
Tennessee Governor's Residence Foundation. She was appointed by President Ronald
Reagan and confirmed by the Senate of the United States to a 10-year term on the
National Museum Services Board.</br>
She was a member of the Maury County Planning Commission, and in 1997 was
awarded the Lucille Queener Courtney Community Service Award.</br>
Her love and knowledge of history and genealogy was generously shared with the
many who sought their roots in Middle Tennessee. She was among those who
reconstituted the Maury County Historical Society, and collaborated on several
books concerning Maury County, most recently the Historical Society's �Historic
Maury County: People and Places.�</br>
She and her husband, Reuben C. Algood, were responsible for the donation of the
Athenaeum Rectory to the APTA, and she served on the initial board dedicated to
the restoration of Rippavilla Plantation. For many years she served in various
offices of the local organization to shepherd the house through its restoration
and maintenance as a significant historic site.</br>
She was a member of the Tenassee Chapter, Daughters of American Revolution, the
Capt. James Madison Sparkman Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy,
and James K. Polk Memorial Association.</br>
A much beloved mother, grandmother and great grandmother, Alice Wright was
married to John Robert Hartley by whom she had a daughter, Patricia Grace and
for 55 years to Reuben Clark Algood by whom she had a daughter Rebecca Clark.
She is survived by her daughters Patricia Algood Junkin, and her husband G.
Bruce Junkin, and Rebecca Algood Moon; her grandchildren Jefferson Bruce Junkin
and his wife, Gabriela, William Clark Moon, and Bennett Rebecca Moon; and her
great grandson, Jesse Caleb Junkin, born February 27, 2010.
