BRYANT, Uncle Major, 5 Sep 1802 - 11 Aug 1853. "To the memory of Uncle
Major a faithful &amp; trusty servant to Mrs. Elizabeth Bryant, born Sep 5th
1802, died Aug 11th 1853" </b>Section 1.<b>
(Stone broken, placed on top of another tomb (box
style). The death date has long since shaled away but I can confirm there was a
stone peddler that came thru selling this style of stone in the Culleoka area
during the 1853 time frame and all of the stones shaped like the above are
crumbling away today, so the limestone was mostly of inferior quality.Â <br/>
