Following Highway 99 west out of Columbia, just before entering Hampshire
Community , turn right just past Cedar Hill Church of Christ on the right onto
Taylor's Store Road. Follow this road around to Loves Branch Road and turn left
there. Following this road will bring you around to the Morrow
Cemetery sign on the right just before a large barn. Turn right on this chert
road and follow it around to the left. This is the entrance to the cemetery. The
cemetery is fenced all the way around the mound that forms the cemetery. This is
the only entrance and the only exit.</font></br>
