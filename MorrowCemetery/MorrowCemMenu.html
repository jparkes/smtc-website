HISTORY</font>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The land for the Morrow Cemetery was given by John Wesley &amp; Alice Rebecca
Love Morrow. They owned and lived on the property at the time in a house on
Loves Branch Road. John Elihue Morrow bought this farm and owned it for several
years. This particular farm is owned by the Blocker family and a public road
leads to the cemetery. In later years this cemetery property was deeded by Ocy
Blocker for the cemetery. This is a perpetual care cemetery and donations to the
Morrow Cemetery fund help with the maintenance of the site. The manager of these
funds is Mildred Morrow Parker of 4000 Trotwood Avenue, Columbia, Tennessee</font></font></p>

MORROW CEMETERY, A LABOR OF LOVE</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On March 23, 2007, Sandra
Gibson Lindsey and Faye Elliott Jackson came together to record the Morrow
Cemetery off of Love's Branch Road in rural Maury County near Hampshire,
Tennessee.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Manley Walker Morrow and
Lettie Pearl Anderson Morrow buried here are the grandparents of Sandra and
Faye. Our love of genealogy was passed from Louise Morrow Elliott, the daughter
of Manley and Lettie Morrow. Gerline B. Morrow Gibson, Sandra's mother is also a
daughter of Manley and Lettie. We have many fond memories of going to this
cemetery on various occasions and sitting on tombstones and having our picture
made. We dedicate this work to the memory of Louise Morrow Elliott , who
instilled in us the desire to be keepers of the records of this cemetery and
help preserve our great heritage. This is also dedicated to Gerline B. Morrow
Gibson who survives and tells everyone she sees that she is a Morrow.</br>
</br>
Respectfully,</br>
</br>
