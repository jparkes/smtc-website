  <strong>
  The Coopers, 1859-1975</br>
  </font>
  </strong>
  In 1859, the house was sold to William Frierson Cooper a member of
  the influential Cooper family of Columbia. He changed the name to Riverwood
  since it sat upon bluff's overlooking the river. A respected lawyer and
  politician Cooper was a member of the committee who wrote the Tennessee state
  codes. He later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.
  Although he remained a bachelor his entire life, he invited his brothers and
  their wives to share the home with him since the family had become increasing
  involved in the politics of the state and needed a home for conducting their
  entertaining in Nashville.</br>
  </br>
  In the late 1880-90's the house went though another extensive remodeling at
  which time, plumbing and electricity was added. At that time, the dining room
  was extended and the two houses were joined, creating an additional room on
  the second floor directly over the downstairs portion of the addition. From
  that time however, no other major work was done on the interior or exterior of
  the house, and it has remained virtually untouched.</br>
  </br>
  Upon his death, William deeded the house to his brother Duncan Cooper, an
  influential lawyer and politician who gained notoriety during the Civil War as
  a cavalryman under Nathan Bedford Forrest. He was known as the &quot;Francis
  Marion of the Confederacy&quot; and was an affective guerrilla leader in
  Middle Tennessee until he was captured in 1864. After the war, he returned to
  Nashville and engaged in a number of pursuits: adventurer, businessman,
  railroad engineer, newspaperman and politician. National notoriety came to him
  in 1908 as a personal dispute with Edward Carmack ended in the controversial
  shooting and death of Carmack in the streets of Nashville.</br>

<strong>Duncan Cooper and Family on the steps of
Riverwood Mansion</font></br>
</br>
</strong></i>He retired from public life in 1909 and on the death of
 his wife, Duncan Cooper's daughter Sarah became mistress of Riverwood helping
 raise her younger siblings. When he died, Miss Sadie inherited the house and
 surrounding property. Sarah married Dr. Lucius Burch, a renowned surgeon and
 dean of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and lived in the house until
 her death in 1975.</br>
 </br>
 The Burches were famous for their once a year Christmas Dinner, as all of the
 elite of Nashville vied for an invitation. Once given the invitation was for
 life and hundreds of friends streamed to the mansion throughout the day. Sarah
 and Dr. Burch opened their house to many of the young students at Vanderbilt
 and Robert Penn Warren spent a summer in one of their cottages during his stay
 at Vanderbilt university.</br>
 </br>
 Throughout the years, Riverwood was used extensively for entertaining and for
 political gatherings for the Cooper-Frierson clan and their friends and
 business acquaintances. The Cooper family papers describe the many affairs with
 guest lists that include seven presidents, numerous foreign dignitaries and
 many distinguished visitors.</br>
 </br>
 Riverwood has been referred to as one of Nashville's grandest homes. It was
 lavishly decorated and filled with magnificent furnishings and works of art.
 The home was recognized as a seat of Southern hospitality for over a century
 and a half and throughout the years, was the scene of lavish parties honoring
 many of the South's most famous and prominent figures. Family records indicate
 that presidents Jackson, Polk, Pierce, Johnson, Cleveland, Roosevelt, and Taft
 and Vice President Adlai Stevenson were personal friends with the Coopers and
 were entertained at Riverwood. And the poet Robert Penn Warren&nbsp;spent a
 summer at Riverwood when he was a visiting Professor at Vanderbilt.</br>
 </br>
 Riverwood is a house where men and women of all walks of life have been
 entertained. And since the house was used for entertaining throughout most of
 its history it is only fitting that it be used for entertaining now. As
 Nashville's first Historic Event House, Riverwood Mansion now hosts events for
 its guests and once again is the seat of Southern Hospitality in Nashville!</br>
