Hello Mary Bob<br/>
       
Have you given any thought as to how to correct the Mother's name of Maury
D.
Armstrong, Jr in your list of  people buried at Zion?<br/>
Maury
Davidson Armstrong, Sr's only marriage was to Emma Lipscomb McFall.  They
were the ancestors of my child, grandchildren and great grandchildren and I
would not like for them and their children to be confused about their ancestors. 
I was the 1st wife of M. D. Armstrong, Jr.    Dorothy Armstrong,
that is buried beside him, was his wife at the time of his death. 
I
will appreciate hearing from you.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Audrey
P. Morgan. <br/>
<i>We
have made this change Mary Bob. I do not know if this could be
controversial,  but hopefully this will satisfy all. WA 5/4/06</i><br/>
