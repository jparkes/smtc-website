AR-SA"> in 1865 - daughter of Thomas Garner Polock and Nancy (Liles) McKennon
Born 24 Aug 1829 Died: 22 Nov 1904 Buried: Zion Presbyterian Cemetery, Maury
Co., Tennessee War Record: Volunteered in Company E, 48th (Nixon's) Tennessee
Infantry and 48th (Voorhee's) Tennessee Infantry C.S.A. Thomas Simpson Cooper
married Lavonia McClain of the old and established McClain family of Lewis
County. She was ten years his junior and not over sixteen when they married. She
bore him a son, and was never well afterward. She apparently had tuberculosis
from which she hemorrhaged, and which finally cause her death. The Civil War broke
out and his brothers had all enlisted (except Paris Cooper); so he too,
volunteered leaving his sickly wife and infant son. We can imagine the trauma of
this parting. Her letters to him are pathetic although brave. His mother wrote
on April 6, 1863: &quot;Vony is no worse than when Thomas left home. She has had
no hemorrhage since.&quot; But Vony lived only eighteen days after the letter
was written. Thomas was stationed at Tullahoma at the time of his wife's death
and he went home on furlough for her funeral, and never returned to service. He
found that he was unable to take care of his son, Martin McClain Cooper, who had
been named for his wife's uncle. The baby was only twenty months old when his
mother died and his mother's family reared him. He married Sarah E. McKennon in
1865. She was 5 years his junior and bore him 5 children , one son and four
daughters. Thomas bought the &quot;What and John&quot; place from her uncle,
John Farris which is located eight miles from Columbia on the Hampshire Pike.
His daughters lived in the old house until they died. Ref: Lillian Word Roberts,
