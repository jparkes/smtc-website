<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080">FRIERSON, Robert, b. 6 Mar 
1743 in S.C. - d. Jun 1808 near Franklin, Tenn.**, 65 yrs old. &quot;Revolutionary 
War.&quot; (Oldest grave in the cemetery.) Revolutionary War Soldier (Pvt. ï¿½ SC): 
Battle of Kings Mountain, Battle of Cowpens, and the fall of Charleston. After 
freedom was won, he became a relatively wealthy farmer in the Williamsburg 
District of his native state. When the members of the Presbyterian Church, of 
which he was a member, decided to migrate to the newly opened territory of 
Middle Tennessee, he moved his family in the caravan. They rented land near 
Franklin for a year or so until the area south of Duck River was opened up and 
then moved into the region that would become Maury County. It was during this 
wait that Robert Frierson, already 65 years of age, passed on to his final 
reward. At his request, his remains were taken to the newly cleared burial 
grounds beside Zion church, in the heart of the tract of land that would become 
home for his children for generations to come, and there interred as the first 
burial at that site. Mr. Frierson had married Miss Elizabeth McCauley in early 
life and to them were born seven children.<br>

**This area was a part of Williamson County in 1808. Maury County was formed a 
year later in 1809 off of lands of Williamson County. Franklin is the county 
seat of Williamson County Tn. To call this near Franklin 34 or so miles north of 
here is accurate for the 1808 era.</font></b><p align="center"><i><b>
