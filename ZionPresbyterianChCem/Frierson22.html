FRIERSON, Samuel, 15 Dec 
1765 - 9 Jul 1815. Revolutionary War. He was a planter and an elder in the Zion 
church, ordained by Bethel Presbyterian Church, Kingstree S. C. before 1806. He 
with his family and other family members move from South Carolina to Maury 
County, Tennessee, in the spring of 1806. Both he and his wife died in Maury 
County Tennessee near Columbia and both are buried in the Zion Presbyterian 
Chruch Cemetery, the church they and other relatives organized and built in 
1807--even before they built their own homes. The original Inventory and 
Appraisement paper of the Personal Estate of Samuel Frierson, dated November 18, 
1815, signed by fellow elders of the Zion Presbyterian Church are in the 
possession of his descendants, as is a copy of Sarah W. Frierson's will. One of 
the signers was a Thomas Stephenson who was also a brother-in law of Samuel 
Frierson.)<br/>
