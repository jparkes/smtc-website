The son of Capt. Robert Cooper (Rev. War Soldier) and Jane Hamilton Cooper. The
most detailed account of his life will be found in the proceedings of the Grand
Masonic Lodge of Tennessee - &quot;Lodge of Sorrow&quot; of November 1879 which
was a memorial to him. He served 1824 as Deputy Grand Master when President
Andrew Jackson was the Most Worshipful Grand Master; and in 1825 was elected
Grand master and was re-elected in 1826 and continued to serve until 1827.&nbsp;</br>
Matthew D. Cooper was the youngest of thirteen children and not six years old

Mary Agnes Frierson Cooper died in May of 1834, leaving him with four children
ranging in ages from fourteen to five. That same year he dissolved the company
of Cooper, Caruthers &amp; Co. on June 6 and shortly thereafter he entered into
a partnership with an English cotton merchant by the name of Chapman, forming a
banking and brokerage business in New Orleans. On July 7th of the next year he
married Elizabeth Jane Frierson, a cousin of his first wife who was twenty-seven
years his junior. The marriage lasted three years as she died with consumption
when she was but a few days past nineteen. Her only child, Flavel Frierson
Cooper was born on March 16th and she died on October 17th of 1838.&nbsp;</br>
After the death of his second wife, Matthew Cooper established another
commission house in 1839 under the name of M.D. Cooper &amp; Co., the company
being Duncan Brown Frierson (1807-1863) and George O. Sweet. This firm continued
until it was brought to an end by the depression of the Civil War. Matthew
Cooper continued to keep his home in Columbia where he was also a member of
another mercantile firm, but had also established a residence in New Orleans and
he commuted between the two as did his children and servants. The next year
after buying &quot;Mulberry Hill&quot;, he married Marian (called Mary Ann)
Witherspoon Brown, the daughter of the famed Rev. Duncan Brown. She was only
nineteen and thirty years his junior. He was a successful business man with
businesses in Tennessee and New Orleans. He had one of the most beautiful homes
in the country staffed with countless servants and some hundred slaves who lived
on the prosperous plantation. He was respected and honored by all who knew him.
He had a total of 14 children; William Frierson, Edmund, Alfred, Jane, Henry,
Mary Agnes, Flavel Frierson, Martha Ann, Duncan Brown, Alice Jane, Addison, Emma
Sweet, Eloise, and Fannie Cooper.&nbsp;
