  Hi Mary:</div>
<div>
  Early information is sometimes confusing on the Pattillo's. I have the 
  following notes for John Franklin Pattillo: <br/>
  <br/>
  John Franklin Pattillo was born 1770 or 1778 and was the son of Reverend Henry 
  Pattillo, a well know Presbyterian Minister, and Mary Mindred "Mille" 
  Anderson. Reverend Pattillo was from Kinnesswood, Portmoak parish, Scotland. 
  He immigrated along with his brother, George Alexander Pattillo, in about 1740 
  to Virginia. John was one of eight children. <br/>
  <br/>
  He married Harriet Hyde in 1826 probably in Thompson Co., New York. He and 
  Harriet had four children: Harriet Caroline Pattillo, and Robert Goodloe 
  Pattillo. <br/>
  <br/>
  Harriet Hyde was the daughter of Robert Hyde and Elizabeth Goodloe Harper. <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't have much more. I hope this is helpful. My husband Eddie is a descendant 
  of George Alexander Pattillo.
