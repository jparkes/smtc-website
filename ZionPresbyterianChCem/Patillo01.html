  Hi Mary:</div>
<div>
  Early information is sometimes confusing on the Pattillo's. I have the 
  following notes for John Franklin Pattillo: </br>
  </br>
  John Franklin Pattillo was born 1770 or 1778 and was the son of Reverend Henry 
  Pattillo, a well know Presbyterian Minister, and Mary Mindred &quot;Mille&quot; 
  Anderson. Reverend Pattillo was from Kinnesswood, Portmoak parish, Scotland. 
  He immigrated along with his brother, George Alexander Pattillo, in about 1740 
  to Virginia. John was one of eight children. </br>
  </br>
  He married Harriet Hyde in 1826 probably in Thompson Co., New York. He and 
  Harriet had four children: Harriet Caroline Pattillo, and Robert Goodloe 
  Pattillo. </br>
  </br>
  Harriet Hyde was the daughter of Robert Hyde and Elizabeth Goodloe Harper. </br>
  </br>
  Don't have much more. I hope this is helpful. My husband Eddie is a descendant 
  of George Alexander Pattillo.
