Article on Blowing Spring Cemetery</font></br>
Rick,</br>
</br>
You have a very good writeup on Blowing Spring Cemetery.&nbsp; I read it several</br>
times and decided to write you.&nbsp; I am 75 years old and live at Knoxville.&nbsp;
I</br>
have a Grandmother, Minnie McKinsie Wires/Warise, buried in Blowing Spring</br>
Cemetery.&nbsp; She was the daughter of Matha Holloway and Frank McKinsie.&nbsp;
She</br>
was born about 1884 and died in Dec. 1905.&nbsp; Her grave is not marked.&nbsp;
I</br>
would suspect that it is under one of the fieldstones.&nbsp; She married my</br>
Grandfather, Reuben Daniel Wires/Warise, on 26 March 1898.&nbsp; They had 3</br>
children of which my father, Arnold V. Warise, was the second.&nbsp; Reuben and</br>
Minnie lived somewhere on the Old Military Road near the Cemetery. I had not</br>
not seen the Cemetery 'til after I was married, but I remember my uncle,</br>
Mack McKinzie (Minnie's brother) telling my Father about Blowing Spring</br>
Cemetery about 1939 or 1940.&nbsp; I remember that they planned to go there</br>
because Mack could point out the exact grave.&nbsp; It would please us very much</br>
if Minnie's name could be added to the list of those buried there.</br>
</br>
Very truly yours,</br>
Ken. Warise</br>
