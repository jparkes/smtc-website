This is a photo of the large number of Unmarked stones that grace Blowing Springs Cemetery.
The area is in a remote section of the county and there was not a lot of
resources for the purchase of marked stones in the early years. However, these
fieldstones might have been placed before stone inscription became widely
available in the early to mid 1800s.Â  <br/>
