<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A
little history and legends associated with the Blowing Spring Cemetery and
community. The community, spring, and cemetery are located south of Mt. Pleasant
on the old Military Road (now known as Dry Creek Road). James R. Bennett, first
man legally hanged in Maury County, is buried in the small but well-kept
cemetery. For many years, his grave was one of the many graves in this cemetery
that were unmarked. Today a visit to the cemetery will find a tombstone placed
on his grave, but you will still find many graves still unmarked or marked only
by a fieldstone or undertaker�s marker. James Bennett�s grave is the oldest
marked grave in the cemetery � dated 1827. I have not been able to locate what
year the cemetery began to be used, but the next oldest grave is that of William
Williams from 1895.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Legend
also tells of a monster snake, said to have lived in the cave near the springs,
which was so large it could drag off yearlings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The
following was written by Jill Garrett on June 14, 1987 and is included in her
book, <u>�Hither and Yon� II </u>(1992).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Monsters
once lived in Maury County. They are all gone now apparently � or else no one
has admitted to seeing one recently.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Be
honest � would you believe anyone who said he had seen a snake �as big
around as a stove pipe?�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Our
monsters seemed to have been snakes and the king of them all lived in a hole at
Blowing Spring. This spring is on the Dry Creek Road about four miles from Mt.
Pleasant. Today it is a pretty little spot and the Blowing Spring Cemetery is
adjacent to the spring.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;A
news item appeared in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Columbia Herald</i>, dated 22 Dec 1871, noting that some 8 or 9 feet
above the spring was a hole about 10 inches in diameter and �out of this hole
in the summer there is always a strong, cool breeze blowing.� The water was
clear, pure and cool.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The
good water and the cool breeze are still there. Not long ago one person told me,
�You can freeze to death in August� from the breeze.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;But
beware. In 1871 it was said �a sickly, nervous sensation always creeps over
him who dares to approach too near.� Something evil lurked there at one time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;In
the fall of 1871 a group of hunters stopped at the spring. After a short rest
they cut through a nearby corn field. They found something had been in the field
before them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;According
to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Herald</i>: �The corn had been
laid by and the grass was nearly knee high. Near the center of the field they
were surprised to find a trail some 6 inches broad and the grass mashed flat,
showing that some heavy body had been hauled or dragged along.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Following
the trail, the hunters were convinced it was the path of an enormous snake. In
the dust they could see the print of 49 rattles and one button. The length of
the rattles was 12 inches � meaning the snake was at least 50 years old and 12
feet long.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
snake�s trail led to a cavern-hole above the spring.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The
unknown citizen who reported the incident to the newspaper declared Blowing
Spring was the home of this terrible monster, �for numerous swine have ranged
about this spring and disappeared, leaving no trace, and several yearling calves
have roamed in that vicinity but never returned.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">At
times �a terrible sickening� odor came from the snake�s lair. But no one
ever investigated the hole.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">People
in the area made a box to capture the snake. If the snake were ever caught, this
was never reported to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Herald</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Was the
whole thing some sort of joke? It is believed something was there for the 1869 a
smaller monster snake had been killed in the Widow Stone neighborhood. (Today
this area would be about a mile from Bethel Methodist Church as this church
began as Stone�s Chapel at a site on the Stone property.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It was
reported: �People in the Widow Stone neighborhood have been scared about a big
rattlesnake, supposed by those who have seen him on divers occasions, to be a
monster in size.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A
farmer, named Chapman, was driving his cow along the road one afternoon �when
all of sudden she broke off in a different direction.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Chapman
looked down and �beheld the monster snake which had been the terror of the
people so long.�</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">He was
stricken with fright and could not move for several seconds. �He did nothing
until he began to breathe free� it was noted. He had been squirrel hunting
before getting his cow so he took the gun and shot the snake in the head. It had
27 rattles.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Tall
tales? Maybe. For some reason, though, the hole above the Blowing Spring was
filled with dirt about this time. No snake stories about the spring have been
reported to this paper since 1871.<br>
