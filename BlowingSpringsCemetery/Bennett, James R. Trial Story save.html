<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">By

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The date of 2 April 1827 holds
an important place in the history of Maury County. On this date, James R.
Bennett became the first man legally hung in Maury County. Although this was
Maury County�s first legal hanging, the practice was an ordinary part of the
day. The hanging of James R. Bennett would have lasting effects on the citizens
of Maury County and the family of James R. Bennett.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Almost 67 years after the
event, Caroline O�Reilly Nicholson, widow of A. O. P. Nicholson, would recall,
�I was haunted by the uncanny face of the doomed man.� Mrs. Nicholson did
not attend the hanging herself. She wrote that she was one of a number of girls
who went around to Mrs. Voorhies to get a look at Bennett. They saw him come out
of the jail and get into a cart that would carry him to the gallows. She wrote
that the gallows stood at the bottom north of the old cemetery, and that they
were left there long after the hanging as a warning to evil doers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The hanging affected
Thomas D. Cathey in such a way that he would tell members of this family that he
never wanted to see another man hanged.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The effects on the
Bennett family were long lasting as well. Murder seemed to follow the family in
the coming years. Ezekiel Bennett, son of James, would be murdered by an in-law
about 50 years after his father was hanged. James� grandson, Israel Thomason,
would later be arrested for the murder of another.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Throughout the years,
many questions have shrouded this important event in the history of Maury
County. Along the way, many of the facts became hidden or became so embellished
with each retelling of the story that fact and fiction were hard to separate. In
most of the retellings, the victim of James R. Bennett�s crime was left
unnamed. It was told that he was a soldier, which led Marise Lightfoot to
research the crime and hanging. She found many facts in her research, but could
never find the victims name. Everything was there about the crime and the
hanging, but the victims name could not be found in the Maury County records.
That question and many others were finally answered when Vera Niemiec, of
Lincoln Park, Michigan, discovered that James R. Bennett was her
great-great-grandfather and wanted to know more about the events surrounding the
crime that led to her Bennett�s hanging. Through her research much of the fact
and fiction were separated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Her search for the truth
led her to Nashville where she unearthed the court files that had been sent from
Columbia to the Supreme Court in Nashville. These files opened the doors of her
research into the case.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;She learned that the
actual crime took place on 17 February 1826, when Bennett shot Thomas Callahan.
Callahan lingered until the 18<sup>th</sup>  and died. The bullet struck
Callahan near the eleventh rib, and by the time the doctor arrived, there was no
hope for his life. Bennett used a rifle to kill Callahan. The court records
revealed the value of the rifle to be worth five to fifteen dollars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;This was not Maury County�s
first murder or murder trial, but this one would have a different outcome. The
first murder trial in Maury County took place in 1816 when William Magill was
tried for the murder of Dr. Charles Simpson. During the course of the trial,
Magill broke jail and escaped. The first person accused of murder in Maury
County was Nancy Christian, accused of murdering her child, but these charges
were dropped in 1817. In October 1825, Joachim Lindsey murdered his wife, but
made his escape. A few months before Bennett shot Callahan, two men were gunned
down on the public square in Columbia. Once again, the murderers made their
escape. Bennett would not find his charges dropped or make his escape. He would
face trial and the outcome would mean the end of his life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The jury was summoned and
Bennett faced trial for the murder of Thomas Callahan. The jury was made up of
Samuel H. Williams, William Allen, John O. Davidson, John Farney, Ephraim E.
Davidson, William Kerr, William Pillow, Anthony M. Copeland, William Voorhies,
Thomas Gill, Franklin R. Houston, and William Jennings. With each witness
brought before the court, more and more details of the life and character of
Bennett were revealed. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Much of the
testimony centered on Bennett�s drinking habits, and his 1822 conviction of
counterfeiting which resulted in his property being sold at public auction.
Witnesses stated his mind became �disordered at this.� One witness recalled
that Bennett was drunk during the sale, and �talked of killing the officers.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Besides the testimony
about Bennett�s character, one can learn a few interesting things about the
Blowing Springs area from testimony given during the trial. Witnesses alluded to
the fact that there was a gang of outlaws who roamed the hills south of the
Blowing Springs, and that Indians were still traveling along the Military Road.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Some of the testimony of
witnesses revealed some interesting facts about the jails of the time. Two
jailors testified in the trial. One remembered that while in jail Bennett was
�frequently going round the jail all night flashing pistols.� The other
jailor revealed that Bennett was drunk when put in jail, then sobered up in a
day, then got hold of more whiskey and was drunk again. We think the jails are
liberal today, but back then a prisoner still could access his guns and his
whiskey.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;One of the witnesses
during the trial was Chiles McGee. It was not revealed during the course of the
trial that McGee was prejudiced against Bennett. McGee had been one of the
prosecutors during the trial for counterfeiting which resulted in Bennett�s
conviction of those charges in 1822. McGee revealed that Bennett was a �judicious
man� and �drank too much as well as himself.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The judge did try to help
Bennett out a little. He urged the jury not to pay too much attention to the
drinking, as every man saw a drunk in a different way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Perhaps the most damaging
testimony came from Archibald James and Samuel McConnell.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Archibald James traveled
81 miles to testify at the trial. He recalled during the month of February 1826,
he was traveling on the road passing Bennett�s house. About a quarter mile
before he got to Bennett�s, he heard the report of a gun. As he approached
Bennett�s house, Bennett came out to the road with blood on his hands,
proclaiming, �I have caught the villain at last.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Bennett invited James,
along with a Mr. Smith who was traveling with some wagons ahead of James, to
come into the house.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;James went into the house
to find a man lying on the floor bleeding. Bennett revealed to him that he had
shot the man, and if James did not believe him to ask his wife.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;James described the
injured man as �an old infirm man, lying groaning, and I heard him ask that a
doctor might be sent for.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;James left the Bennett
house, traveled down the road about a half mile and camped for the night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;James met Samuel
McConnell and told him what had happened at Bennett�s house. The two men went
back to Bennett�s house where James testified that Bennett seemed to be in
something of a rage and �looked strange but was not drunk.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Cross-examination of
James further clarified that James did not think that Bennett was drunk, and
stressed that James had never seen Bennett before this meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;McConnell was the next
witness called. He recalled seeing Callahan going to Bennett�s the night
before the shooting. He described Callahan as �old and infirm and badly
dressed.� The next morning McConnell went to Bennett�s to borrow an auger.
When he arrived at Bennett�s still house, he saw Bennett and Callahan sitting
together, drinking and repeating verses. He said, �They appeared to be
friendly to each other.� He did not return until the next day, when he
returned with Archibald James. He revealed the time to be between sunset and
dark. When he went into the home, he found Callahan �lying down, groaning and
bleeding.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In the course of his
testimony, McConnell revealed things told to him by Callahan before he died.
McConnell testified that Callahan told him that Bennett was a murderer and had
wounded him without cause or reason. Bennett�s response at hearing this was
that he thought he was master of his own house, that he had �aimed to shoot
him through the heart�, and he did not think he had made too bad of an aim.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Callahan also revealed to
McConnell that he was inhabiting a camp near Bennett�s house, and that Bennett
said, �he had made too free in his house.� Bennett described Callahan as a
pilfering old villain and that it was his �right to kill such.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The last thing Callahan
revealed to McConnell was that he had been in the artillery for 21 years and
that he was on his way to meet his son.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;With each bit of
testimony, Bennett�s fate was sealed. Despite the urging of the judge not to
pay too much attention to the drinking, Bennett was found guilty and sentenced
to hang on 26 September 1826. The jury�s statement being �on that day he
shall be conveyed by the sheriff of Maury County to a gallows erected on the
common of Columbia and then hung by the neck until dead, and may the Lord have
mercy on his soul.�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The date of 26 September
1826 went unchallenged for many years, until Mrs. Niemiec discovered that
Bennett appeared in court again in January 1827. He appeared in person before
the Supreme Court and made an appeal. The appeal was denied and a notation in
the Supreme Court records revealed that the hanging took place on 2 April 1827.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The hanging was a big
event, drawing huge crowds to Columbia. The site chosen for the hanging was a
small bottom on the Duck River. This site is about where the John Harlan Willis
Bridge is today on Highway 31. It was said that even whole families attended the
hanging together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The sheriff, Nimrod
Porter, was in charge of the hanging. After securing the noose, Bennett was
moved into position over the trapdoor. The records do not reveal to us if
Bennett was blindfolded or if his head was covered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Porter went down
underneath the gallows, took an axe and knocked the props from under the
trapdoor. Bennett then dropped through the floor. Porter was paid $12.50 for
building the gallows and his services at the hanging.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Bennett�s body was
taken to Blowing Springs Cemetery for burial. His grave lay unmarked for many
years. He was survived by his wife, the former Rachel Alexander, and four
children: Mary (about 7 years old), Israel W. (about 6 years old), James K.
(about 4 years old), and Ezekiel (about 2 years old).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Rachel Bennett married
John Davis on 23 Feb 1828 in Maury County and had six more children: Lucinda (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">James
Brock</i>), Alzada (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married James Chapman</i>),
William, Allen (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married Minerva ?</i>),
Jane and E. D. Davis. Some have speculated that she and John are buried at
Blowing Springs. She died after 1860.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Mary Bennett married
William C. Thomason, son of William Thomason and Polly Morand, on 4 Mar 1839 in
Maury County. Together they were blessed with 12 children: Angeline Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">wife of John McClain</i>); Israel Washington Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Lillian King &amp; Ann Elizabeth Chumbley</i>); John F. Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Mary</i>  ?); Joseph Alexander Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Elizabeth Chumbley and Lucretia Munford</i>); Caledonia Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Eli King</i>); Margaret Thomason; Nancy Thomason; Rachel Thomason; Lizzie
Thomason; Kate Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married Samuel
Washington Hedge &amp; Seaton Higginbotham);</i>  Isabel Thomason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Samuel Washington Hedge</i>); Jackson C. Thomason <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(married Nancy Jane Blackburn &amp; Bertie Mae Doyle</i>); and J. Monroe
Thomason. Mary died after 1870.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Israel W. Bennett married
Malinda N. Allison on 16 Jan 1849 in Lewis County. The family can later be found
in both Lewis County and Lawrence County on census records.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;James K. Bennett married
Sidney Jane Devasier on 30 Nov 1840 in Lawrence County. He and Sidney were the
parents of six children: William F. Bennett (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married
Martha Rogers</i>), Aaron Alexander Bennett, Susan Jane Bennett, Druscilla Ellen
Bennett (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married Green Drewry Devasier</i>),
James K. Bennett (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">married twice, Mary A.
&amp; Alice</i>), and Jesse Monroe N. Bennett. James died 28 Oct 1900 in Lewis
County, Tennessee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Ezekiel Bennett married
Mary ? and can be found on some census records as a farmer in Lawrence County.
He was killed by an in-law about 50 years after his father�s death.</p>
