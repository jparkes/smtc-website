(Santa Fe) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

</font>This topographical
map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Willis Jones Cemetery, but the roads are
obsolete on this map and cannot be utilized to find this cemetery. The
topography is great though</font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"></br>

Map showing the route and mileage from the intersection of 43 and Hwy 7.&nbsp;</br>
Directions 1987: In Santa Fe, just before reaching the Post Office, turn left
and go about 3/4 mile to Beatty Farms. The cemetery is in area occupied by
barns. It is surrounded by an iron fence. Directions 2009 updated for new roads:
Go out Hwy 7 (Santa Fe Pike) passing by the Snow Creek Road. Snow Creek Road is
also a cross over to the old Santa Fe Pike, but pass on by that continuing on
the new road and you will start up a long slope. As you get well into the climb
(about 3 tenths of a mile) look to your left at the farms over in the Creek
Valley, at the old Beaty Farm place. At least one house and several barns are
seen in the distance, but slightly behind the road from the north lane. Continue up the slope but just before the tree line on the
left &amp; right picks up turn left into the long downward driveway and at the
bottom stop at the house on your right for permission and directions to visit the
cemetery. The yellow arrow I have added here continues the path to the cemetery.
It is bit rocky &amp; hazardous in spots to city dwellers, so caution here
is needed. This is active cattle ranching here, so be careful not to disturb the
livestock or stir up the Bulls, otherwise you might need a Rodeo Clown and I am
sure you will be the clown to the Bulls.</br>

</span></font>An
Aerial Map shows highlighted in yellow the travel route with the cemetery marked
with a red cross. Recognize this is a private drive after one turns off of
Highway 7 and permission must be secured. The current owners welcome cemetery
visitors and keep records of such, so tell them your story and leave your card,
but please, no surprise visits. All this is private farm assets. When you turn
left into the private drive following the yellow arrows the slope is quite steep
so careful there.&nbsp;</br>

The road marked Beatty Farm Ln no longer exist or is plotted in the wrong place
by Bing Mapping here so ignore that. The turn off as shown above is another 200
yards north up the slope.</br>
