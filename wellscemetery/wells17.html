<center><b>WELLS, Lucinda,
13 Sep 1810 - 1 Nov 1862. ï¿½Wife of David Wells'. Inscription reads:
&quot;LUCINDA WELLS Wife of David Wells Born Sept 13th 1810 Died Nov. 1st
1862&quot;. Lucinda was the second wife of David Wells. David would marry a third
lady who was Priscilla (Warden) Kerr the widow of John B. Kerr. The descendants
of Priscilla passed it down that the third marriage had no issue. However, there 
are conflicting reports on this from other Wells researchers. In my (C. Wayne 
Austin) box of old
unidentified photos there is a photo of an Arvie Wells which was
made somewhere in Texas. My Gr. Grandmother thought enough of the photo to keep it.
Was Arvie the child of David &amp; Priscilla or was he a son of G. W. &amp; Dovy
Cornella Ausban Wells? If you have knowledge of Arvie Wells let us know and you may have a
copy of this photo. C.W Austin, 22 Dec 2002</b></center>
