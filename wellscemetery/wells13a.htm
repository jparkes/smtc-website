tomb that has no inscription. In front of it is a stone that looks like a base
but is very soft and crumbly. It is buried deep into the ground and probably was
the stone where the the inscription was placed. </b></font><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wellscemetery/wellsunmarked04.jpg" width="640" height="480" > </center>

that is located in front of the un-inscribed box tomb. It is soft and crumbly. I
attempted to uncover it and stopped when I discovered it was crumbly. I believe
the inscription resided here for the unmarked box tomb. The unmarked boxtomb
probably only served as a grave cover. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p><center><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>This stone was
carved but unmarked. It might only be a footstone but is probably an
un-inscribed stone. It will be found in the center of the cemetery leaning
against the Hackberry Tree on the east side.</b></font><p><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wellscemetery/wellsunmarked02.jpg" width="640" height="480" > </p></center>
<center><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>Just over to the
east of the Dovy C Wells box tomb can be found these two parts of stones leaning
against a tree. Notice the fieldstone in the sunlight on your left.&nbsp; </b></font></center>
