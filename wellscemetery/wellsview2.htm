the stones from the south to the north.&nbsp;On the left in the shadows is the
stone of Mary Jane Wells Williams, 1838-1925. Further to the right in the center
is the corner of the box
tomb of Samuel Wells, 1809-1849. Leaning against the large hackberry in the
center is an unmarked stone. On the near right is the top of the stone of Samuel
Wells, 1850-1914. further out on the right is the broken box tomb of Dovy
Cornella Ausban Wells, 1845-1872, wife of G. W. Wells. Further out from Dovy's stone is the
three box Tombs of David Wells, 1812-1888 and his first two wives. <i>Dec 2002 Photo by WA.</i></font></b>

view looking further east at some of
the stones. In the front center is the Samuel Wells Memorial, 1850-1914. To the
near right is the base of the tumbled stones of John (1861-1915 &amp; Addie O'Shea. Gray
spot at the base of the large Hackberry tree on the right is an unmarked
fieldstone. The large trees are Hackberry with a few
scattered Cedars. Appears that when the cemetery was kept up Cedars were the
trees of choice. This is good because due to the strength of the wood Cedars shed no limbs to tumble the stones. The Hackberry Trees came up wild
and took over the cemetery in the last 50 to 75 years. They endanger the stones
from high winds and decaying. They shade the cemetery enough now that Polk Berry
is about the only weed that can grow underneath their canopy during the summer. <i>Dec
