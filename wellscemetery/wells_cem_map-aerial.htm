Here above we see the GPS location explained for the Wells Cemetery. As you can 
see from this map it is perched high upon a hill above the old Wells home. </br>

Go out Hwy 50 southeast of Columbia to Culleoka Hwy (373). Travel that into 
Culleoka and past and on eastward to Campbells Station Road and turn right (or 
south). Go about 1 mile and just before you cross the bridge over the creek 
there will be a driveway to a private home. After permission go into the gate 
behind the house and between the two barns and along the left of the fence road 
and bend left and go up the hill and after winding up the hill bend back again 
now 180 degrees, and go the rest the way up the hill. The cemetery will be 
straight ahead in the middle and smallest of the thickets. That is, one thicket 
on your left and one on the right ahead and the middle one where the cemetery 
will be found. I went there when Mr. Eldridge Martin was living (the owner) and 
he loved visitors on his place and related history to me. I went back not too 
long after his death and it was like pulling teeth to get permission. I have no 
idea what it would be like today.</br>

This is an aerial view of the cemetery plotted with a red check. Notice the 
yellow path I have etched for the visitor to follow. I suggest if you are in 
good health to go past the first green tree line and leave your car and climb up 
the steep hill instead of all that driving. You cannot park and walk straight 
from the road because the Creek &amp; bluff will be between you and the cemetery</b><center><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wellscemetery/WellsCemeteryAerial.jpg" width="777" height="579" ><b></br>
The Wells Family Cemetery can be seen in the (Black Arrow) clump of trees at the
top of the hill high above the South Fork of Fountain Creek. Get there from
Culleoka by taking Highway 373 east a half mile to Campbell Station Road. Turn
right or south and go about another mile. As you approach the bridge across
the South Fork of the Fountain Creek look right at the entrance to the private
farm. Get permission (if you can) to travel past the home and follow the farm
lane around and up the hill to the spot mapped above using the yellow
highlighted pathway. Mr. Eldredge &quot;Red&quot; Martin who in recent years was
a friend of the cemetery has passed away and no longer owns this property.
Respectfully to the owners the last time I was there I was denied passage for
myself and friend Rick Gray. After an explanation including becoming persistence
we were granted passage. I hope your experience is a little more pleasant.
However, be sure you respect their privacy, keep to the prescribed pathway they
give you if different from above and do not disturb the livestock or anything
else.</br>
Blue explanatory text was added later. The yellow path on the last map cannot be 
traveled by truck or car. Too steep. </b></p>
