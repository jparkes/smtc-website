looking at some </b><b>of
the stones from the east to the west. On the left in the shadows of the
tree is the
stone of Felix Wells with the two stones of C. L &amp; Mary Williams on the
right. Further back from the Williams Memorials is the stones of Abijiah &amp;
Polly Mitchell. It is obvious this cemetery needs some attention. Though fenced
it is located high on a hill out in a cow pasture without any access road where
no one can easily visit it. Small fieldstones, and I am sure unmarked graves abound
in the cemetery. It would take a good clearing and further investigation to
determine just how many there are. The largest stones have been tumbled probably
by falling trees or vandals. Its deeply disturbing to me to see cemeteries in such bad
shape. What a testimonial to the priorities of
humanity when these sites offer so much knowledge to anyone with the slightest
bit of curiosity whether we are related to these people or not. <i>Dec 2002 Photo by WA.</i></b>

view looking at some of
the stones from the southeast to the northwest
 the same as above, but a from further into the cemetery. It may very well be
that most of the open areas are filled with unmarked graves. <i>Dec
