WELLS, D. C. A.,
13 Jun 1845 - 17 Jan 1872. �Wife of G. W. Wells.� (Dovy Cornella (Ausban)
Wells was the daughter of James &amp; Elizabeth Violet (Crockett) Ausban who are
interred in the Elkridge Cemetery in Giles County, Elizabeth died shortly after
the birth of Dovy who was her second child. Her first child was Elizabeth Violet (Ausban)
Kerr wife of Josephus J. Kerr, (Box
tomb, top broken in half but otherwise intact.). There has been much discussion 
of where G. W. Wells is interred. Some say here beside his wife which is most 
likely true. Others say he moved on and remarried since Dovy died young at 27 
years of age. G. W. was Civil War (conscription) age so he might have died in 
that war likely as a confederate and seven years later his wife maybe died of a 
broken heart.<br>
