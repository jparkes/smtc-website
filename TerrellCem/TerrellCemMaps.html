There is active cattle ranching around this cemetery, so be careful not to disturb the livestock or
stir up the Bulls, otherwise you might need a Rodeo Clown.<br/>

In Spring Hill turn west on Beechcroft Road (Hwy 247), and go something under
5 miles. Just after you pass the Petty Road on the left the Terrell-McKay house
is on the left back off of the road. The cemetery is in grove of trees behind
and east of the ancient Terrell-McKay house. The cemetery is fenced in a field
with heavy cattle farming around it and permission is required as you will
probably need an accompanying person to keep the livestock calm. Postal address is 1199.<br/>
