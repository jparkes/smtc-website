<p align="center"><b>TERRELL
CEMETERY, (Carters Creek) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/TerrellCem/vIMG_9399.JPG" width="677" height="510"></br>
Aiming your camera from Petty Road this is what you will see in the distance as
the tree lined Terrell Cemetery. It is fenced and surrounded by active prime
pasture land. The historic (private property) home is northwest of the cemetery.</br>

Fallen &amp; broken stone abound here. In the past this cemetery was not cared
for as it is today. A fence is in place today so that livestock cannot trample
the stones anymore.</br>

Fallen &amp; broken stone abound here as in the past this cemetery was not cared
for as it is today. If
someone wished and took action this cemetery could be pristine again with all
the stone standing. I did not see many missing parts and those are likely no
more then 3 inches below the soil. The camera is aiming northeast.</br>

Forgive the white patch. We are concealing private farm
assets. This owner has respected this cemetery. His possession are private. In the below photos you will see many more of the white
patches.</br>

On the left is the James &amp; Mary McKay memorial standing and in the center is
two fallen memorials and on the right is the standing memorial of Joe Terrell
and maybe his wife Ella as I did not see her inscription but I was so busy
trying to keep from disturbing the private assets (on hoof) I may have missed
that one.</br>

This shot aiming east shows one of the Jenkins family
footstones, the James Terrell memorial, and the box tombs of John &amp; Mary W.
Hill further back.</br>

This shot aiming west across the tombs of John &amp; Mary
W. Hill into many of the other stones in the distance lying on the ground.
I have a hard time identifying stones from a distance when they are lying on the
ground.</br>

This final shot aiming west from the north side of the
cemetery shows the fallen Dr Hezekiah &amp; his wife memorials on our left on
the ground along with the two upright memorials of the McKays &amp; Joe Terrell
and others.</br>
