<p>The cemetery is now enclosed in a barbed-wire fence but
this has not always been the case. A number of the nice monuments have been
tumbled and/or broken. [F.L.H. 1987.] Still true in 2009. Only three memorials
in this cemetery have not been knocked over by cattle in the past. All of the
others are now gradually sinking into the soil to eventually be lost to sight
below the ground.</p>
<p align="center"><i>This cemetery was compiled
by Wayne Austin from a visit there 24 Feb 2009. Other sources for the writings
were from Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, by Fred Lee Hawkins, Jr. page 133.
Mr. Fred visited this cemetery 10 Feb 1987.&nbsp; This cemetery is also presented in
the book They </i><i>Passed This Way about
1967 Page B-72 by Evelyn Shackleford &amp; Marise Lightfoot, two ladies of the
1960 era who researched cemeteries and gave us great works, some of which was carried
over into this effort.</i></p>
