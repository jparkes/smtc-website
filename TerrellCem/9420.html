CEMETERY, (Carters Creek) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

Agniss P. Jenkins (fallen and broken memorial, bottom of stone likely is
nearby). We see in this photo two footstones of the style that would match
Agniss's headstone. I believe one footstone belongs to the headstone of Agniss
and the other footstone belongs to the memorial of Elizabeth P Jenkins which is
covered by soil in this photo. Later I discovered it below the soil and cleaned
and made the photo. <br/>

JENKINS, Agniss P., 10 Sep 1834 - 26 Dec 1835. (the 3 in the death year is
covered by a leaf)<br/>
