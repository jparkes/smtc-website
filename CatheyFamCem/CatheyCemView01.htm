This view looks southwest across the cemetery from the northwest edge. Those
blue dots are not sad ghost, but a defect in the way digital cameras capture
reflections in color when photographing into the sun light. Well, some of you
hold outs are not convinced I know.</br>

Looking at the cemetery from the southeast side. We are looking northwest. This shows
most of the stones. One can readily see the old limestone/sandstone memorials
from Missouri &amp;/or Arkansas. The have been well kept comparatively speaking.
About all of them have footstones at the foot of the grave and headstones at the
head of the grave. Lichens and mosses live on these stones and can make them
hard to read. Only one box tomb exist in this cemetery. The others are
traditional upright ones. There are a couple of modern granite memorials. One of
them being the Red Granite Kennedy Memorial set by descendents with special
knowledge about this graveyard I am sure.<i></br>
