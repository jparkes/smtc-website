We are standing on the southern edge of the cemetery next to the fence shooting
north to west at the lessor populated area of the cemetery. The Kennedy stone is
visible here in the upper left edge of the photo. <img border="0" height="555" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CatheyFamCem/vIMG_6506.JPG" width="740"/></b>

Standing just behind the heavily populated area of the cemetery shooting west.
One can get a good feel for the stones out there by their shape. That
helps you as you go thru the individual stones keeping their location in mind.
Notice the two tall dark oval top shaped stones far out. I thought those
identical style stones were for a husband and wife, and may be, but the distance
between them may indicate otherwise, unless their memorials are on either of
some unmarked graves of their children.<i><br/>
