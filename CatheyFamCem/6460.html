<b>CATHEY,
Jane, no Tombstone. (b. 1756 ; Daughter of Griffith Rutherford; wife, James
Cathey; mother, Griffith Cathey; mar. 2nd a Mr. White.)<br/>
There is a long stretch of area between Griffith Cathey and the next marked
grave in this row so there is no telling who is buried there. Likely one grave
is that for Jane Rutherford Cathey. The next stone down in this row is for
Suzannah Cathey wife of Griffith Cathey whose stone is on our immediate right.
There is a small worn &amp; broken tombstone between Susannah &amp; Griffith
with no remaining inscription.</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
