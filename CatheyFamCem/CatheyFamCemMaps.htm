</font></b><center><b><font color="#800000"  size="2">This
cemetery is called the Cathey Family Cemetery from olden times.<br>
Go west on Hwy 412/99 several miles and veer right (or northwest) onto Taylors
Store Rd. Keep that for about 2.5 miles and turn left into Love Branch Road.
Follow that for just under a mile and pass the Southpoint Ridge Road on your
right. Look ahead about 100 yards and the cemetery will be upon the small hill on your right
about 50 yards from the road.<br>

I may have this cemetery pegged too close to the road on this map as the streaky
spot just northeast of there near the tree line may be the place you will find
this cemetery. That is more consistent with graves that line up north and south
facing east.<br>
These directions are based on mapping analysis and are not guaranteed to to be
accurate. </i><br>
