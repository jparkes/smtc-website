This is the Holt family area of the cemetery. In our immediate view are two
fieldstones that mark graves, but have no inscription. How do I know they mark
graves? The stones are standing on their edge and within the same row as the
marked graves. An unmarked grave without stones may take on either of two
characteristics. One a sunken area where the grass grows taller. Two an area
that is mounded up due to being back filled over time into a mounded spot. That
is done by wary relatives who know that heaping up the soil disperses the rain
water and preserves the grave better.<br/>

Panning the camera to the right of the above photo we get this photo of the
cemetery. Notice the two Holt family memorials of identical style with the large
space between. You figure that one out.<i><br/>
