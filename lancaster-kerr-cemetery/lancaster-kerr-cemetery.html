<center><p><b>Lancaster-Kerr Cemetery is located 2 miles
east of Glendale. On Hwy 50 turn left on the second leg from Columbia of the Old
Lewisburg Pike just east of where Fountain Creek crosses over Hwy 50. After
turning go 1/4 mile and branch right onto Bryant Road and the cemetery can be
found just ahead in the forest on the right very near the road. There are many
more graves with unmarked stones that those that are inscribed. Mounds of
block shaped rock are piled upon many of the graves probably to protect the grave from vandals and
varmints. Many of these stones were carved in a elongated fashion by a stone
carver but were left rough and do not contain any visible inscriptions. This
cemetery is so grown up the only time one can adequately research it is in the
winter time when the vegetation is dormant. I did not find the John F. Wright
stone reported by previous researchers. Probably missed it due to the high
vegetation. </b></p><p><b><a href="../index.html"><img <="" border="0" font="" height="64" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lancaster-kerr-cemetery/../buttontornad.jpg" width="120"/></a>
