Looking at a layout of the Church and Cemetery one finds the Cemetery entrance
as being behind three iron gates with&nbsp;</br>
 the last boundary encountered
being the gates marking the entrance thru the historic rock fence. The progression of the photographer was from east
to west beginning with the burials in the upper left corner (Southeast) area of
the layout because some of the yard in the front area is
being used for burials. Once inside the Rock fence I covered the cemetery beginning with the
east edge of the rock fence and progressing row by row to the west. Drawing not
