<h1 align="center"><b>REESE'S
CHURCH, CAMPBELLSVILLE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE</b>
 
<b><br/>
The church is currently unused and is maintained by a committee. Back of the Church is the
Cemetery. Many old burials are here with inscriptions dating as early as 1814. The inscriptions on the
soft stones are wearing away
and becoming unreadable but thanks
to previous researchers there are records of who is interred here. </b><center><img border="0" height="493" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/I0690.JPG" width="656"/><b><br/>
Looking northwest at the old historic Reese's Church building which was at one
time the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Some of the yard in the front area is
being used for burials, but the main Cemetery is behind the church enclosed in a
metal &amp; rock fence. Photo by WA. 6/7/2003<br/>
