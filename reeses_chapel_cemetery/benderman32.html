DEATH'S HARVEST</br>
&nbsp;Mr. W. F. Benderman, a prominent and highly esteemed citizen of Cross
Bridges, died suddenly this morning at 5 o'clock of heart failure. Mr. Benderman
had just arisen and dressed himself for the day when he fell and expired. He was
a man of great corpulence, weighing something like 300 pounds at the time of his
death. He was 64 years old. The funeral services will occur tomorrow morning at
Reece's Chapel, conducted by Rev. J. E. Hight, and interment will follow in the
cemetery there. Mr. Benderman left a wife and five grown sons and one daughter
to mourn his sudden demise. He was a generous-hearted, honorable citizen and
enjoyed the friendship and esteem of all the people of his community. The Daily
Herald, Columbia, TN, Tuesday, July 14, 1903, page 3.</br>
