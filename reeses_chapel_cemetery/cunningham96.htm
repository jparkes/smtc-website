<p><b>CUNNINGHAM, Matthew,
18 Jan 1772 - 22 Jan 1841. 69-00-04.(Box tomb.) &quot;SACRED To the memory of
MATTHEW CUNNINGHAM who was born January the 18th 1772 and departed this life
January 22nd 1841. Age 69 years 4 days.&quot; This memorial is in the deep woods
back in the far southeast corner of the Cemetery against the rock wall. The area
is infested with Poison Ivy and Rock Chiggers. Well snakes too, but I am not
afraid of that element since I know the dangerous from the harmless ones. <i>Photo by Wayne Austin, Aug 30, 2003.</i></font></b></p><P><b><a href="reeseslist.htm"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/../buttontornad.jpg" </font width="117" height="62"></a>
