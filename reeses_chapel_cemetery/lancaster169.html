</b><b><i>Sacred
to the memory of Malinda C. Lancaster Wife of Elisha Lancaster who was born February 7th 1816 &amp; departed this life August 14th 1847 Aged 31 years 6 months and 7 days. Her melancholy friendship bends, weeps. A friend, a wife, a mother sleeps. A heart
within whose sacred call. The peaceful virtues loved to dwell. In An affection warm and faith sincere, and soft humanity were there. The domestic virtues enlightened in death rest
here." A Photo by Wayne Austin 5/31/2003.</i></b></p><p><b><a href="reeseslist.html"><img <="" border="0" font="" height="62" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/../buttontornad.jpg" width="117"/></a>
