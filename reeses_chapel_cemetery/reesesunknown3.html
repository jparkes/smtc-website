This was probably the remnants of a broken &amp; partially buried base of a box tomb. 
It is located 3 paces south and 8 paces west of the next photo below which is a 
partially buried &amp; broken box tomb top without a base. It is likely these two stone groups were at 
one time a complete box tomb but who would ever know if the two match up? It is
located in the Maxwell and Colburn and Dooley area. <i><br/>

There is some inscription remaining on it but I did not spend enough time to collect that 
thinking incorrectly that I could read it from the photo. I can clearly see an "n" a 
"d" and an "a" &amp; "r". <i><br/>
