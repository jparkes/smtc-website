Inscribed on the latch post of the gate to the Cemetery into the historic REESE's Church
Cemetery one finds this inscription:<br/>
<br/>
 </b>Hark from the tombs a
doleful sound. <br/>
My ears attend the cry. <br/>
Ye living men come view the ground where you must shortly lie.<br/>
1825.<b><br/>
There are graves older than 1825 in this cemetery so these post must be a later addition (1825) to the cemetery. The
oldest dated stone is 1814 and there could be unmarked graves earlier than that.
Looking at the engraved post there will be the Cemetery Grounds to your right and to your
left is the Church Building. <br/>
