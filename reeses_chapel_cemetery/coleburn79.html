COLEBURN, Sarah F,. 8 Nov 1825 - 2 Jun 1834. From the appearance of
stone,placement of the grave and dates of birth Sarah F. appears to be the
daughter of Thomas F. &amp; Isabella and the other Coleburn stones here in Reese's Chapel Cemetery probably belong to other family members. Notice the
death of three of the children Sarah F., Amanda, &amp; Calvin occurred over a
short span of 5 days during June 1834. This probably indicates the ravages of an
infectious disease. Most likely it was Cholera. <i>Info and photo by Wayne Austin 6-19-03</i><p></p>
