<p><b>THOMAS, Isaac Jetton,
25 Oct 1781 - 11 Aug 1844   Inscription reads: In Memory of Isaac
Jetton Thomas. He was born October 25th A. D. 1781 and departed this life
August 11th A. D. 1844. He lived a life of industry and integrity in the
practice of those in ones which command respect to the living and ______ for the
dead to which he added the crowning virtue that heareth him through life and
sustaineth him in death. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He that believeth Me
though he were dead shall he live. Isaac Thomas was born in Iredell County,
North Carolina and most likely died in Lawrence County, Tennessee. He served as
State Representative for Tennessee at one time representing Lawrence County. He
was married three times with all three wives being buried
here near him. The first wife Asenath Houston died in 1824. She was the
mother of his children. His second wife was Mary. As far as I know he had no
children with her. She died in 1830. In 1834 he married the former
Martha W. Moody. He had no children with Martha, but his surviving children
remained close to her and helped to settle her estate when she died in
1875 as she had no children of her own. She remembered them in her will.
Note: I am not sure what the rock was on the top of the box tomb but did not
want to move it. This is the best I could make out the inscription, but feel it
is pretty close.<br/>
