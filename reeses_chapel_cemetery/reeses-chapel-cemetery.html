<p><b>Reese's Church and Cemetery is located 9
miles south of Columbia Tennessee on the Campbellsville Pike. It is behind the
old Reese's Chapel Church building, an old historic church building that is well
maintained. Going south after one passes the Mt Pleasant Lane or sometimes called
Reese's Church Road go past that 200 yards and look for a lockable metal gate
(5-31-03) on the right.  The Church and Cemetery are down that road due west 100 yards inside
two more gates. <br/>
 There are at least 6 known Revolutionary Soldiers interred in
this Cemetery. It is thought Charles Alexander the seventh was also buried
there. <br/>
 For more information on this Cemetery see the book Historic Ebenezer
Presbyterian Church &amp; Cemetery", by Virginia W &amp; Charles C.
Alexander; there are listings included there which are not on this site due to proprietary
reasons. <br/>
Another source is: "Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries", by Fred L
Hawkins.  Included in this book are more histories and
biographies of those interred in this cemetery. <br/>
Another source, an excellent treatise on Charles Alexander's Revolutionary
service &amp; life is included in the book "Let the Drums Roll, Veterans
&amp; Patriots of the Revolutionary War who settled in Maury County
Tennessee", by Marise P. Lightfoot. There you will find the R. W. service
and some biographical info on all the Soldiers listed in this cemetery as
serving or aiding the American Revolutionary War effort. </b>
