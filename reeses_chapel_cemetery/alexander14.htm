Capt. J. N. Alexander Appears For Final Review Before the Great General<br>
With the death of Capt. J. N. Alexander at his home four miles out on the
Campbellsville Pike at 1:20 o'clock Saturday morning, another land mark has
passed away and the county has lost a worthy citizen. Capt. Alexander has passed
the eightieth milestone on the journey of life. For the past year he had been in
feeble health and his death was not unexpected. Funeral services and interment
took place Sunday at noon at Reece's. ____Wharton in charge of services.
Fearless, but gentle, and tender hearted as a little child, rugged in his
honesty and integrity of character, meeting every duty and requirement as a
husband, a father, a citizen without ostentation or display. Capt. Alexander was
one of _____ noble men and beloved and esteemed by all who came within his
influence. At the outbreak of the Civil war he joined the Forty-eighth Infantry,
Dunham's company, and when the bloody battle of Kennesaw Mountain was fought and
Capt. Dunham was numbered with the dead, J. N. Alexander was made Captain of the
company and no captain in the service was more honored for his fearless conduct,
or more beloved for his care and devotion to his men than he. He was a member of
the Bigbyville Lodge of Masons and is survived by his second wife, who was Miss
Hendley, and the following children: Mrs. James Estes, Mrs. S. J. Thomas,
William Alexander, Miss Mollie Alexander, Miss Johnnie Alexander and Jim
Alexander.<br>
