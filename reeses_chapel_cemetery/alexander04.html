 ALEXANDER,
 Sarah, 2 Feb 1778 - 22 Nov 1839. Age 61 yrs. (Dau. James &amp; Elizabeth B.
 Reese; Wife of Silas Alexander. Silas moved to Fayette County Tennessee,
 died and is buried there.)&nbsp;</br>
 Sarah REESE ALEXANDER was the wife of Silas ALEXANDER and daughter of James
 Polk REESE (my 5th Great-Grandpa) and his wife Elizabeth BREVARD REESE (my 5th
 Great-Grandma). And if I am right James Polk REESE is also buried here in this
 same Cemetery as well. Hope that helps from a REESE/POLK/ALEXANDER descendant.
 Also EASTER was Esther Nancy BROWN ALEXANDER wife of Lt. William Anderson
 ALEXANDER. (Patti Heath) Photo by <i>WA 5/31/2003.</i></p>
