COLEBURN, Isabella, 17 Jun 1790 - 26 Jul 1854. From the appearance of the stone,
placement of the graves and dates of birth Isabella appears to be the wife of Thomas F. and the
other Coleburn stones here in REESE's Chapel Cemetery probably belong to their
children. Notice the death of three of the children Sarah, Amanda, &amp; Calvin
occurred over a short span of 5 days during June 1834. This probably indicates
the ravages of an infectious disease of the time. Most likely it was Cholera. <i>Info
