<p><b><i>DAVIDSON, Francis,
d. 22 Apr 1832. 60 years. (nee Bateman, 2nd wife of John Davidson.) "This
stone is placed here to show the living that here lies the Body of Francis
Davidson who departed this life the 22nd day of April A.D. 1832 in her 60th
year. Her flesh shall slumber in the ground. Till the Last trumpet joyfully
sound. Then burst the grave with sweet surprise. And in her savior's image rise.
Then she shall see and hear and know all she desired or wished below. And every
power find sweet employ. In that eternal world of Joy". Photo and
