Wayne, I was just looking at Reese's Cemetery and noted that W. N. Billy Webster
is listed as being buried there.  That is incorrect.  I remember when
Billy died, and I would imagine he is buried in the Webster cemetery at Cross
Bridges, or at St. John's.  <u>I KNOW he is not at Reese's</u>.  <i>Virginia
