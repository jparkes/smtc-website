<p><b>MILLS, Gideon, died 29
May 1829. No Birth Date. This stone is located out by itself up against the
south Rock wall. This is the only person with an inscribed surname of Mills in
this Cemetery. Maybe in 1829 Gideon Mills was not established in the community
but passed away, or it is possible that he had other family members and they
weren't supplied with a marked headstone. Well, I always wonder what a single
family member with a stone out by itself meant, since the other established
families tended to have assigned clusters of grave spaces. <i>Photo &amp; information by Wayne Austin,
