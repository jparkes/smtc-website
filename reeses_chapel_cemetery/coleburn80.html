COLEBURN, Amanda E., 29 Nov 1830 - 8 Jun 1834. From the appearance of stone,
placement of the grave and dates of birth Amanda E. appears to be the daughter
of Thomas F. &amp; Isabella and the other Coleburn stones here in REESE's Chapel
Cemetery probably belong to other family members. Notice the death of three of
the children Sarah F., Amanda, &amp; Calvin occurred over a short span of 5 days
during June 1834. This probably indicates the ravages of an infectious disease
of the time. Most likely it was Cholera. <i>Info and photo by Wayne Austin 6-19-03</i><p></p>
