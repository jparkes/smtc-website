<p><b>THOMAS, Asenath
Houston, 11 Jan 1784 - 23 Aug 1824. �Wife of Isaac J. Thomas.� (Box tomb)
Isaac
was married&nbsp;three times&nbsp;with&nbsp;all three&nbsp;wives being buried
here&nbsp;near him. The first wife (here) was Asenath Houston who died in 1824. She was the
mother of his children. His second wife was Mary (Interred in this cemetery
also). As far as I know he had no
children with her. Mary died in 1830.&nbsp;In 1834 Isaac married&nbsp;the former
Martha W. Moody. He had no children&nbsp;with Martha, but his surviving children
from Asenath remained close to her and helped to settle her estate when she died in
1875&nbsp;as she had no children of her own. Martha remembered them in her will.
(A Footstone with the initials&nbsp; S.A.E.H. is lying on the surface of this
stone.) <i>Photo &amp; info by Rick Gray &amp; Wayne Austin July 4, 2003.</i></font></b></p><P><b><a href="reeseslist.htm"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/../buttontornad.jpg" </font width="117" height="62"></a>
