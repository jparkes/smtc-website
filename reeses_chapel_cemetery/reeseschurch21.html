 This photo is another view of the old section looking at the Coffee
(Center Row) and Knott (Left Row) box tombs. The row of small stones in front of
the box tombs belong mostly to the Alexander family. The tall stone further out
&amp; on the
right is the Martha W. Kennedy stone.  In front of that are the box tombs of
the Isaac Thomas family. </b></center><b>Many
of the older and smaller stones have a footstone nearly as large as the head stone
making a photo such as this confusing. For instance o</b><center><b>f
the six stones in a row to our left of the Coffee Box tombs only two of them
have footstones situated further to our left in front of the box tombs. <i>Photo by Wayne Austin 8/30/2003.</i><br/>
