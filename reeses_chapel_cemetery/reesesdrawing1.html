This is a rough sketch of route the photographer took to photograph the stones
in this cemetery. We are interested in this because proximity of burials is a
major clue in determining family relationships. If you click on the photo that
is displaying you will see a number in the name of the photo. That can be used
to determining the proximity of the stones to one another. The progression of the photographer was from east
to west beginning with the burials in the upper left corner (Southeast) area of
the layout because some of the yard in the front area is
being used for burials. From there I covered the cemetery beginning with the
east edge of the rock fence and progressing row by row to the west. The main
list of photos are presented alphabetically by surname and given name. This
drawing is not
