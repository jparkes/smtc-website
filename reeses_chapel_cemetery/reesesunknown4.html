This box stone coated in cement is located in old section. It is in a row of three box 
tombs in a line up from south to north first as this stone then the Susanna Ramsey 
stone and last the Esther L. Henderson memorial. I am not certain who 
it belongs to since the inscription has long since been lost.

&nbsp;This box tomb is located in the center of the cemetery near the Henderson, Maxwell and 
Coffee areas. The most likely dates of the above box tomb is between 1830 an 1855. 
I do not believe this stone ever contained an inscription because most of the top looks 
original to me. <i>Photo and info by Wayne Austin 8/30/2003 </center></i><center></pre>
