<b>BENDERMAN, Ella Coffey, 1868 - 1898, Unknown stone marker. This stone is just to the left of the John W.
Benderman memorial and is probably the marker for his 1st wife Ella Coffey
Benderman.&nbsp;</br>
</b></font><b><i></br>
</i>We think this unknown field marker is for that of Ella Mae (Coffey)
Benderman, who was the first wife of John William Benderman. An obituary in the
Columbia Herald dated Dec 22, 1898 says: 'Mrs. John Benderman of Ettaton,
husband and five children survive, daughter of Med Coffey of Campbell Station,
Cumberland Presbyterian'. The obituary does not mention a burial place, but
cemetery researcher Wayne Austin had already suspected this to be the burial
place of a wife of John W. Benderman.<i></br>
