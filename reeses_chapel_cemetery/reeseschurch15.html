CHURCH, CAMPBELLSVILLE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE</font></b><center><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/img_1195.jpg" width="640" height="480" ><b></br>
This photo is from the center of the cemetery looking northwest at the older
section of the cemetery. The small stones are the oldest spanning from 1815 -
1840. The box tombs are in the 1830 - 1860 timeframe. The small white stones are
the Military Markers. Surnames out there in this photo are Thompson, Clanton,
Henderson, Reese, Coffee (box tombs in the back), Alexander and others. The three small stones out front
are actually footstones for the head stones in the back of each. Obviously
the graves are in between.&nbsp;The above stones have been reset recently by a
restoration committee that has done a great job. By Wayne Austin 8/30/2003.</font></br>
