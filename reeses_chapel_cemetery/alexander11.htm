</i>DEATH'S HARVEST<br>
On Sunday morning last at 7 o'clock, Mr. William A. Alexander entered into peace
at his home near Bigbyville, in the 75th year of his age. The funeral services
and interment took place Monday at Reece's Church near Bigbyville. Deceased was
widely known and universally admired and respected for his manly traits of
character. He was twice elected sheriff of this county and served his county in
that capacity for four years; making some mistakes of the head but none of the
heart. He had also served for a number of years as a Justice of the Peace,
holding that office at the time of his death. He leaves surviving him a wife and
the following children: Mrs. John M. Burns, of Columbia; Mrs. Jilian Frierson,
of Summer, Miss.; Mrs. Tennie Alexander, of Midlothian, Texas; Mrs. Wm. Burns,
of Wayne county; Mr. Thomas Alexander, of Mt. Pleasant; Mr. Robt. L. Alexander,
of Midlothian, Texas and Mr. D. B. and Misses Willie and Lou Alexander of
Bigbyville. The bereaved family have the sympathy of a large circle of friends.<br>
