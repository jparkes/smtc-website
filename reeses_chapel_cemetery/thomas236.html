<p><b>THOMAS, Mary N., 10
Dec 1795 - 25 Oct 1830 or 1831. �Wife of Isaac J. Thomas.� (Box tomb, top
badly eroded.) Mary was the second wife of Isaac J. Thomas. Isaac
was married three times with all three wives being buried
here near him. The first wife Asenath Houston died in 1824. She was the
mother of his children. His second wife was Mary (Interred here). As far as I know he had no
children with her. Mary died in 1830. In 1834 Isaac married the former
Martha W. Moody. He had no children with Martha, but his surviving children
remained close to her and helped to settle her estate when she died in
1875 as she had no children of her own. Martha remembered them in her will.
