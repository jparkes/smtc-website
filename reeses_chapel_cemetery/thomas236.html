<p><b>THOMAS, Mary N., 10
Dec 1795 - 25 Oct 1830 or 1831. �Wife of Isaac J. Thomas.� (Box tomb, top
badly eroded.) Mary was the second wife of Isaac J. Thomas. Isaac
was married&nbsp;three times&nbsp;with&nbsp;all three&nbsp;wives being buried
here&nbsp;near him. The first wife Asenath Houston died in 1824. She was the
mother of his children. His second wife was Mary (Interred here). As far as I know he had no
children with her. Mary died in 1830.&nbsp;In 1834 Isaac married&nbsp;the former
Martha W. Moody. He had no children&nbsp;with Martha, but his surviving children
remained close to her and helped to settle her estate when she died in
1875&nbsp;as she had no children of her own. Martha remembered them in her will.
