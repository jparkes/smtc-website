<p><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">KERR, Margaret
Anjeline, 2 Feb 1832 - 4 Nov 1832 00-09-02. Inf. dau. of William &amp; Margaret
N. Kerr,ï¿½&nbsp; &quot;SACRED To The memory of MARGARET ANJELINE infant
daughter of William &amp; Margaret M. Kerr who was born February the 2nd A.D.
1832 and departed this life November the 4th 1832 aged 9 months &amp; 2 days. I
cannot positively place this William &amp; Margaret Kerr, but the Kerrs of Maury
County in the early days were Presbyterian. It is my opinion that this William
is also a grandson of the original Kerr progenitor of Maury County who was James
Kerr of the Spring hill area but I cannot at this time place him with one of the
sons of James. There is a researcher out there which escapes my memory that
believe this William is from another whole different set of Kerr's from North
Carolina and she has books and research to back up her claim, but I myself
discount that theory simply because this William Kerr is young enough to be
child bearing age in 1832 and that makes him fit easily into being the son of
one of the many sons of James that came to Maury County. This William could not
be the son of William Kerr 1781 - 1853 because that William already has a son
named William that died young. Also the religion matches up. Absolute proof is a
rare commodity in the old genealogies. <i>Photo &amp; information by Wayne Austin,
