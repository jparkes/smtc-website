</i>AGED CITIZEN OF SCOTT'S MILL DEAD</br>
John Benderman, gallant Confederate soldier, splendid citizen, and last survivor
of a numerous family of brothers and sisters, died at 6 o'clock this morning at
his home near Scotts Mill in the sixth district. Mr. Benderman was eighty-seven
years of age, one of the oldest citizens of the county. He had lived a simple
life, a good, kind neighbor, a citizen beyond reproach, ready at all times to
assist one in trouble. He had the esteem of all his neighbors and there is
genuine regret at the passing of this kindly old man. Mr. Benderman volunteered
early in the great war between the states and served with credit. He is survived
by two sons, Robert and James Benderman, of that community. The funeral services
will be held at Reeces Chapel tomorrow at 11 o'clock and the remains will be
interred in the graveyard where so many of the family have found their last
resting place. Daily Herald, Columbia TN, Friday, Jan 20, 1922, page 1.<i></br>
