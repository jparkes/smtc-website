This is the top of a broken child's box tomb and it contains a partially readable 
inscription that could be matched up with previous researcher's list of inscriptions. 
I was unable to read it due to the Poison Ivy all around. It is located in the far 
south west corner almost next to the rock wall in the brush. Interestingly there is a rose 
bush of the old style grown by the early settlers that might be over a hundred years old. 
 It is growing by this fallen child's box tomb. It was probably planted by the family of the 
child's tomb. My Mom had one of those she planted in the early 1960s and in year 
2000 when her heirs sold her place it was still a young plant.  Many of her offspring took 
cuttings from that plant to continue the traditional plant in their own yards. <i>Photo

If one looks close there are three old style tomb stones buried in this brushy photo. 
My suspicion is that these are the footstones of the nearby Henderson stones that 
have recently been replaced with granite markers. This is located in the 
south west corner almost next to the rock wall in the brush. That green leaf stuff in 
the upper right photo is Poison Ivy. <i>Photo and info by Wayne Austin 8/30/2003 </i>
