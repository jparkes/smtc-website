Looking west at the old historic REESE's Chapel Cemetery at the north &amp;
middle area of the cemetery. Very large box tombs indicate graves earlier than
the 1850s. The tall stones were used up until the 1890s or so. The smaller round
top stones shaped like a person with a head on their shoulders are very old also
going back to the earliest stone above being about 1815. Many of the earlier
ones are not the hard granite found today but are composed of stone of various
levels of durability. A 1990 File photo by WA 6/7/2003.</font></br>
