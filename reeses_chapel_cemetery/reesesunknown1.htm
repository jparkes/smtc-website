readable inscription from the stone it is included in the list on this site.

<p><b><font  size="2">This box tomb is located in the center of the cemetery near the Henderson Maxwell and 
Colburn areas. There is some lettering remaining but not enough complete the 
inscription. One can make out the word &quot;Sacred to the memory&quot; There are a few other 
letters there. If you like a good challenge take the book Maury County Tennessee 
Cemeteries with you and visit this tomb. Next try to match the letter clues with a 
named tomb to identify it to a listing. <i>Photo and info by Wayne Austin 8/30/2003
