&nbsp;This above sunken area probably is a grave. There is no evidence of a marker around. 
This is over near the south wall. <i>Photo and info by Wayne Austin 8/30/2003

<center>This fallen and partially buried stone is not cube shaped leaving me the indication 
that is a rough cut stone and not a fallen memorial.  It is located in the center of 
the cemetery near some of the oldest stones in the cemetery dated early 1800s. This is 
the Clanton, Thompson &amp; Osbourn areas of the cemetery. <i>Photo and info by Wayne 
Austin 8/30/2003 </i></center>
