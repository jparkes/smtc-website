</i>Mrs. J. T. Alexander, wife of Mayor J. T. Alexander, died at her home in Mt.
Pleasant Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock, at the age of 43 years. Interment
occurred at Reece's church, near Bigbyville, yesterday and the funeral service
was conducted by Rev. W. H. Doss, in the presence of a large concourse of
friends and relatives. Mrs. Alexander was a member of the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church and was a devoted Christian woman. For fifteen years she had
been an invalid, and for several months past had been confined to her bed, which
had prevented her from doing active service in the Master's vineyard. She was a
true and noble woman and had the love and respect of all who knew her. In all
her long suffering she exhibited great patience, and she bore her affliction
with uncomplaining fortitude. She leaves, besides her husband, one daughter and
two sons to mourn her loss. While death is always sad, this good woman has gone
beyond her suffering, and is now enjoying the sweet rest and everlasting peace
that is promised those who place their trust in God. In the heavenly home she is
far better off. We extend our sympathy to the bereaved family. The Daily Herald,
Columbia, TN, Wed.,Sept. 11, 1901, page 3.
