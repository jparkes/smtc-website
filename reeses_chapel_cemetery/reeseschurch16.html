CHURCH, CAMPBELLSVILLE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE</b><center><img border="0" height="480" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reeses_chapel_cemetery/img_1199.jpg" width="640"/><b><br/>
This photo is also from the center of the cemetery looking north at the older
section of the cemetery. I am located about 75 paces to the south and 20 paces
to the west from the previous photo or just beyond the small round-top stone of
the Elizabeth Osbourn memorial on your right. Many of the box tombs have long since lost
their inscription and they have been concreted over by the restoration committee
to stop the erosion. The small stones are the oldest spanning from 1815 - 1840.
The box tombs are in the 1830 - 1860 timeframe. <i>By Wayne Austin 8/30/2003.</i><br/>
