To find this previously lost cemetery, go east on the Culleoka-Lewisburg Hwy 373 and turn left
(north) on McKibbon Road. When the road forks, take the east or right fork and
that will continue to be McKibbon Road. Go 1/2 mile from the fork and get out
and walk 300 yards north into the woods and the two box tombs Mr. Bill Thrasher
mentioned in his communication of 5 Apr 2008 should be found. The Geological
Survey mapping agrees with Mr. Thrasher concerning the whereabouts of this
cemetery. It is shown at Latitude: 35 degrees 28.47' North and Longitude: 86
degrees 55.61 West shown marked above with the red check.<i><b>
