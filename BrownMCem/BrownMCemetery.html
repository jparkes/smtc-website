<p align="center"><b>BROWN (McCLINTOCK)
FAMILY CEMETERY, CULLEOKA.</br>
</br>

This cemetery has been destroyed according to researchers who published the book
&quot;They Passed This Way&quot; during 1964. Tombstones were moved away. They
said many people in the area remembered this cemetery and several people told them
about the stones being taken away. The following list, was given to Mrs. Aubrey
Wright (1964). She obtained the information from Mrs. Clyde Orr of Mooresville Tenn.
Both of whom are descendents of persons buried here. Mrs. Orr and Mrs. Wright
attended the funeral of Elizabeth Brown, the last person buried there. The
property at the time was owned by Leslie T. Lee.&nbsp;</br>

 Some of these inscriptions were copied by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Orr many
years ago The others are those known by them to be buried here. The birth dates
of these are from the Federal Census records.

</i><b><u>Update 4 Apr 2008 from Bill Thrasher</u>: Fred Hawkins shows this one as having been destroyed. 
I think the directions may have gotten mixed up. If You turn at the beer joint and when the 
road forks go right on Mckibbon Road instead of going left on McKnight Road. The first farm 
on the left belongs to Mr. Finley and there is a cemetery on top of the hill behind his house. 
All I could find was 2 Box Tombs, unmarked, but I think this may be McClintock Brown Cemetery.

I agree with you Bill. Based on the Geological Survey's mapping they also say it is on the McKibbon 
Road on top of a hill about 1/2 mile from where the road forks. Now obviously all those people 
above are not interred in two box tombs so that means maybe other graves have been destroyed 
or sunken below the ground. <i>Wayne Austin, 5 Apr 2008.</i>

<p><b>Several descendants of McClintock Brown who are listed as
being buried in his family cemetery are actually buried in TX. My husband is
descended from McClintock's son, McNeal Brown, who was probably buried in the
Brown cemetery in the 1860's. However, McNeal's wife, Eliza Vincent Brown, ended
up in Hunt Co., TX with some of her children. Census records show she was still
alive in 1900, but she died before 1910, presumably in Hunt Co.</br>
</br>
Another son of McClintock Brown was Franklin Columbus who went to TX with his
wife, Harriett Vincent Brown. Harriett was a sister to Eliza and was killed by
Indians in Parker Co., TX in 1863. Franklin died in San Marcos, Hays Co., TX in
1904 and is buried in the city cemetery there.</br>
</br>
Still another son of McClintock, Washington Brown, is believed to be buried in
the Eddy cemetery in McLennan Co., TX along with his wife Priscilla.</br>
</br>
Also my notes show that Albina (Brown) Gifford died abt. 1855 in TN, so she
could be buried in the Brown Cemetery. However, Robert Gifford remarried and
went to MS; he's on the 1870 census of Prentiss Co. Several genealogies on
Ancestry.com show that he d. in AR in 1871, but I've seen no proof as yet.
</br>
</br>
I decided to include Washington Brown in this discussion as well, although I have not researched him as
much as the others.</br>

<p><b>Martha I always thought that listing looked as if it was
compiled from the census records instead of being a true grave listing. So you
are confirming my suspicions. Hope this winds up being the first thread in
telling a more complete story of this cemetery. </br>
</br>
Thanks </b></p>
