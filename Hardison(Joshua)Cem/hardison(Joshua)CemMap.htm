UPdate 31 May 2012 - The above map for hte Hardison &amp; Fox grave has been 
declared incorrect. Discussions with Ruby Thomas says the Fox grave is at the 
last house on the west side of the road before the turn off to the Hardison Cem 
and the Tindell Cem even further down the road.Generally the above markings need 
to be moved south down the road and the Hardison Cem is much closer to the 
highway and not on that high hill.<br>

Wayne, after you pass the house where the one Fox grave is going south, there is 
a little farm lane going to the Joshua Hardison Cemetery. There is a gate there. 
It is not a high hill at all just a rise. It was not bad walking at all. Jim 
thinks it is about 50 yards from Hwy 431, I think it is a bit further than that. 
I would not go in the late spring, summer or early fall though because there are 
rattlesnakes in that area and I am scared of rattlesnakes. Thanks Ruby<br>

This aerial view from Google shows the same place but with a different Imagery. 
The fox grave is at that nearest northern house.<br>
