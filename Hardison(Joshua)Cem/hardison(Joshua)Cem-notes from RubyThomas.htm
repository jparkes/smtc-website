Hello Wayne,

I am attaching 5 pictures Jim and I made in 2006 when we visited the Joshua Hardison Cemetery.  I hope and pray I can live long enough to restore this cemetery to some measure.  One picture is of Ephraim Hardison's tombstone my great great grandfather; one of William J. Hardison's tombstone, Ephraim's brother; one of S. L. (Samuel L.) Hardison's tombstone, my great great great grandfather; one of Joshua Hardison's tombstone, my great great great great grandfather and one of the cemetery in it's present state.  So sad.

Thank you and have a great Memorial Day weekend.

Ruby Thomas
