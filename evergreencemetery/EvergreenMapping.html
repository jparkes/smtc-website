Here we can see the roads we need to take to get to the Evergreen Cemetery.<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/evergreencemetery/EvergreenCemAerial.jpg" width="953" height="383"></br>
This aerial view shows a tacking horse track between the road and the cemetery 
but just slightly northeast of the cemetery. Go down Dodson Gap Road until it 
bear southward. Follow southward more than a half mile until you come to the 
concrete bridge where the stream crosses over to the other side of the road and 
the cemetery is just northwest of that crossing about 100 yards on the west 
(right) side of the road. </center><p align="center"><i><b>
