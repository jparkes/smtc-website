<p><b>Evergreen Cemetery is located 1.5 miles
south on Dodson Gap Road from Campbell Station Tennessee. This is on the west
(right going south) side of the road. and is currently (24 May 2003) behind a racking
horse track with a rock fence above it. The cemetery is in danger of loss of the
stones due to wandering livestock and other natural threats. The owner/lessor of the land
has been mowing the grass (thanks). Most of the monuments are broken
and fallen due to becoming out of level and also trees falling on them. Many others
are buried deep in the ground due to the hillside sliding down on the stones and
burying them over time. These are in immediate danger of being lost
underground. Fragile short lived trees spring up and grow massive in a few years
and in a storm come smashing down on the stones. There at least needs to be a
systematic elimination of such trees as Maple, Hackberry, Gum, Black Cherry and many
others of a short fragile life favoring Oaks (white &amp; Red) and Cedars. There
were three stones found that were missed by previous researchers, Sherby Coffey being
one of them and Ollie Cape being the another. Also the stone marked "Emer
daughter _ _" in the Cavender/Cape/Coffee
area was not listed by any previous researcher. It is buried too deep to read
any other inscription and would take a shovel and hard work to expose the
inscription.<br/>
