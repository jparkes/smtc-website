Coffey; Co. F, 48th Tenn Inf., C.S.A.). Brother of Samuel buried in the Shane Cemetery. JOSEPH M. 
COFFEY was considered one of the prosperous citizens of Maury County, Tenn. He was born March 23, 1844, 
son of Hugh W. and Jennie (Gregg/Gragg) Coffey, and was reared on a farm. At the breaking-out of the 
Civil War he enlisted in Company F, Forty- eighth Tennessee Infantry, Quarles brigade, and was an active 
participant in many of the bloodiest battles of the war. He was captured in Nashville and taken to Camp 
Douglas, where he was imprisoned about four months, and from that time until the close of the war he was
 a prisoner at Point Lookout, Md. He returned home June 30, 1865, and immediately began tilling the soil. 
November 30, 1876, he married Maggie J. Coker, who was born in Missouri November 2, 1858, daughter 
of John M. and Sallie A. (Wilkes) Coker. The children born to Mr. and Mrs.
 Coffey's union are Hugh M., born in 1877; Roy B., born in 1880; Ollie F., born in 
1881; Sallie E., born in 1883, and Shirley E., born in 1886. They are members of the Cumberland 
Presbyterian Church, and Mr. Coffey is a Democrat, 
and an energetic and successful farmer. Much of the info was from an old newspaper obituary.</b></pre>
