CRANFORD HOLLOW RD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

This view shows most of the stones except those two in row 2. Also part of the
Jonathan memorial on our extreme left is cut in half. I saw dung indicating
livestock is present here, but there is not the usual severe damage from that
mostly because most of these stones are set deep into the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

This view shows the stones on row 2 and most of them in row 1. We cannot see the
two stones on our right out of the photo range and that is all that is missing
here. Those can be seen broken and lying on the ground in the above photo. <br>
