Biology &amp; stone cleaning lesson: Each of the different colors in the face of
this stone represent different living substances of mosses and lichens. These
must be killed and flushed away to render this stone perfectly clean &amp;
readable. While bleach will do it, don't use bleach unless you have about five
gallons of water for each stone, and also have time to wait around until the
bleach works its magic. Only then use water to flush the debris off. Bleach not
washed off will over time break down and form feeding matter to the lichens
&amp; mosses and actually make the problem worse. Any cleaning that works well
such as commercially available biowashes cannot be used more often than about
every 5 years or long term harm to the stone can occur. There is also a natural
color change, usually darkening or in some stones lightning, called patination
that represents the change over 10s of hundreds years. That is always to be left
alone. It is a natural hardening and&nbsp; color change to the surface of the
stone which helps protect the stone to some degree. The harder stones such as
flint take thousands of years to fully patinate and&nbsp; one can easily tell an
original carved artifact from a one that is formed more recently by judging the
patination level. </font> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"> <br>
