<p><b><font size="2" color="#000080">E-mail from Hilton Cohea on 28 May 2010 to

On the visitation to the Sarah Cohea Grave I was met by the owner of the land
who graciously took the time out of his day by meeting me there to guide me to
the memorial stone. His act of kindness was one I will always remember. This is
because I believe the Sarah Cohea interred here, is my great, great, great,
great grandmother who is Sarah Sprouse Cohee. All the information and timeline
fits.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#660033"><b>Sarah Sprouse was born in Maryland 1758
(matches age on tombstone). She married Amos Cohee in Caroline County Maryland
on June 17, 1778. Amos was a Revolutionary War veteran in Richardson's Company
of the Maryland Militia by record and moved his family to the Maury and
Robertson County Tennessee area about 1800 (then Davidson County) This is
supported by records found in the counties' archives and subsequent matching
census information of their children. One of which was George W. Cohee stayed in
the area raising his children there. I have all the records or access to them
for documentation. It is a very good in theory only that husband Amos Cohee is
also is buried there with Sarah, she being his wife and she survived him after
his death. Some earlier information on Sarah regarding a connection with Perry
Cohee of the area has since been disproven with more diligent research as
technology has been made available to later researchers.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#660033"><b>So, for information and archival purposes
for future researchers you have my permission to use my research to add to what
you have on the cemetery at Grady Hobbs Farm. </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#660033"><b>I believe based on best data that Sarah
Cohee buried there is the wife of Amos Cohee, her maiden name being Sprouse and
married in Caroline Co, Maryland on June 17, 1778. Moved to the area with her
family in abt 1800 where she died after raising her family consisting of son
John Cohee who moved to Washington County AR in his adult life, son George
Washington Cohee who remained and raised a family in the area, along with son
Peter Cohee who also stayed in the community.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#660033"><b>If I find and further information on my
line of Cohee, I will gladly contribute that. You are free to add my
contribution to the web site. This can only help any future researcher. </b></font></p>
