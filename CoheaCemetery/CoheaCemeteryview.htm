</b>Find this cemetery near the old tree on our right back where the man is
standing. Notice the unique nature of this tree trunk with probably an old
lightning strike damage (large healed split) on the side facing us. That is Poison
Ivy vine climbing the tree so be careful there if you visit here in the summer.
I cannot identify the type tree but believe it to be a Pin Oak. <i>Photo sent in

</br>
To find this cemetery from Culleoka go out Valley Creek Road southwest and turn
left onto Graham Rd. Almost immediately Cross the concrete bridge over Fountain
Creek and go 3/4 mile. Turn right into farm lane. The cemetery is in a small
thicket near a house on the old Grady Hobbs place. The cemetery is just to our
left of the home above.</br>
As you are driving along you will merge with the Rail Road Tracks on your left
and then move away from the Rail Road Track just before you turn right (west).<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
Information and photo by Wayne Austin 26 Feb 2008. You will need permission to
visit here. Please respect the privacy of the home owner. It is clear they do
not wish to be disturbed from the chained driveway, so please respect the locked
chain. Persons with bad intentions will be prosecuted. <b>
