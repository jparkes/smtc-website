To find this cemetery from Culleoka go out Valley Creek Road southwest and turn
left onto Graham Rd. Almost immediately Cross the concrete bridge over Fountain
Creek and go 3/4 mile. Turn right into farm lane. The cemetery is in a small
thicket near a house on the old Grady Hobbs place.</br>
As you are driving along you will merge with the Rail Road Tracks on your left
and then move away from the Rail Road Track just before you turn right. <i>Instructions
were taken from 1988 directions in MCTC and modified to today's maps.&nbsp;
