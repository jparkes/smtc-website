</b>This is an aerial
view of the area where the cemetery is believed to be. You can get there from
Columbia by taking Williamsport Pike to the Sawdust Community. 100 yard before
you reach Craig Bridge Road which turns right stop your car and look left under
the trees. There you will see the last of the old Blocker's Shop (Blacksmith).
The stone remnants of the firing pit can be seen near the road next to a large
tree. The Cemetery and Cabin are shown above. The cabin remains will be about
300 yards south east of where you stopped your car. Now be careful because this
is private land. You must secure permission before exploring these sites in
person. The black arrow points to
the places showing the Cabin, Shop and Cemetery.Â <i><br/>

believe this is a 1997 aerial view using MSN.<br/>
