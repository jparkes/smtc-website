 BLOCKERS CEMETERY&nbsp;</br>
</br>
This family graveyard was known to have been intact about 1916 when Willis Brown
sold the farm on which it was located and entered the U. S. Army. When he
returned a year or so later, it had been destroyed. Mr. Brown stated that the
tombstones had been pushed into an adjoining ravine &amp; covered.</br>
 Sawdust was
once known as 'Blocker's Shop, since Elijah Blocker had a blacksmith shop at
this place on the Williamsport Pike.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left"> Persons who were thought to have been
buried here were:&nbsp;</br>
BLOCKER Elijah, 
b. 1792 in Edgefield Co. S.C.- d. 12 Jun 1857 in Maury Co. Tn. (mar. 1809 in 
Winnsboro, Fairfield Co. S.C. to Susan Priscilla Winn, Ref: Anonymous e-mail to 
M.B. McClain; resigned as J. P.; Capt. 27th Reg. of Maury Co. Militia, War of 
1812.) &nbsp;</br>
 BLOCKER Susan Winn, 
b. ca d. 8 Oct 1852. (Daughter of Gen. Richard Winn; e-mail note from anonymous 
&quot;Susan Priscilla Winn was born 1793 in SC (d/o Gen. Richard Winn), she married 
abt 1809 to Elijah Blocker who was born 1792- d. Jun 12 1857 in Maury Co TN.&quot;)</br>
 BLOCKER Richard, b. 1814 d. 1861. Richard is in Maury Co. Deed Bk. P12, p. 712,

<b>Elijah Blocker's Cabin. The cabin is not standing
today. The cabin photo was obviously taken&nbsp;</br>
in early Spring with the daffodils in full bloom. Notice the cabin is built of
logs but covered in clap board siding that is breaking away re-exposing the
logs. That is evidence of its age. There is a rock chimney on the upper
side.&nbsp;</br>
This old cabin would have made a nice historic restoration relic at one time.

<p><u>Jonathan David Blocker</u>:</br>
Greetings;</p>
<p>My name is, really, Jonathan David Blocker. Elijah was my 4th gr.
grandfather.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, his eldest son, Samuel Augustus Blocker (schoolteacher), moved
his family to the bootheel of Missouri after being in Carroll County for several
years, where he had founded Blockers School (parochial). Samuel's eldest son,
Thomas, married a woman named Iris Brown and started having children.
Apparently, Samuel died early there (possibly from mosquito infestation). So
after Thomas mother died (sometime after 1880), he went back again to Tennessee
for a visit. Being gone longer than he had stated to his wife, she would not let
him back in her life upon his return to Missouri some months later.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blocker then arbitrarily changed her childrens' names to her maiden
name, Brown, and that was that. My great grandfather, James Blocker, at eight
years of age, was suddenly &quot;James Brown.&quot; This lasted until I, three
generations later, decided to *dig* out the truth.</p>
<p>We think it is possible that after Samuel died in Missouri, Thomas
transported his body back to Sawdust for burial in the Blocker cemetery. I just
recently, after 15 years of searching, found that Thomas had moved back to
Tennessee near his 1st cousin, also a Thomas Blocker! The cousin was one of the
younger sons of Richard, Elijah's second son. My Thomas is buried next to his
cousin Thomas (&quot;T.P. Blocker&quot;) in the Bon Aqua Church of Christ
cemetery (in Hickman County near the Maury County line).</p>
<p>I think because of the incredible drive to know who my ancestors are, and
where Samuel is buried, that I made a discovery just last week.</p>
<p>Me, my son, and another cousin whose mother was the Blocker descendant walked
the old Blocker place, visiting Elijah's collapsed cabin. The cuz headed back
toward the vehicles with an older cousin who had also come with us.</p>
<p align="left">I had this &quot;instinct&quot; to just keep walking up a gully behind the
cabin. Suddenly my antennas went up and I felt a literal electrical charge
&quot;leading me.&quot; I walked about 60 - 80 yards and saw a place in the
gully where it was more shallow than the steep banks at the beginning. When I
got there, I crossed it and literally &quot;stood&quot; upon a partially exposed
tombstone, which was horizontal with the landscape !!!!! I almost passed out.</br>

suggesting the remnants of a nearby cemetery.<i> photo by Jonathan Blocker</i></b></p>
<p>This stone was on the western bank of the gully, and where it lay is a nice -
nearly flat - spot large enough for several graves. Upon observing the gully
again, the areas to the right and left of me were much steeper, sharper, and
deeper, while that area near the exposed stone was not as deep, and filled in.</br>

That is a marvelous story of how you have uncovered the cemetery of your
ancestors. I know Mr. Hawkins the premier cemetery researcher of Maury County
during the 1980s did not find the graves, but evidently did a great thing when
he preserved family information passed to him for posterity. He mentioned the
possible burials there. Evidently the cemetery has been lost since about 1917.
Maybe the stones were not thrown
into the ravine as previously told, because you speak of graves and the stones
being together. An effort needs to be made to determine if there are other
stones nearby perhaps fallen below the surface. That will require probing the
ground and using the best available technique. In short there is need is to know the
truth about of how many graves are there and if there are other stones. We
should begin to
think of how the cemetery can be separated from the surrounding land in a public
way that is indicative of a historic cemetery. To do this right will require
research and uncovering the lay of the cemetery and much investigative
work.&nbsp;</br>
&nbsp;</br>
<u>Jonathan Blocker:</br>
</u>The stone I found was on the very edge of the ditch, but still on top where
the graves are. What probably happened is that while the stones were being
pushed into the ditch, one of them went unnoticed flat on the ground, remaining
under a thin veil of dirt right on the edge of the ditch (which eventually
washed away. I do believe the others are in the ditch, as it has a rough
&quot;filled in&quot; look to it. To the left and right of that spot, the ditch
is more steep. But not so where the stone was found. It is much more shallow.</p>
<p>I have been accumulating the facts that will eventually become the real
story. I'll keep a log of the entire process, once it is underway, and we'll
just edit the thing together when we're done . . . showing the various stages of
search, discovery, and completion. Let's just keep in touch on it, and when we
are really able to unearth the stones and check for the graves, I'd love for you
to be there at least for a few hours, and be the editor 'n chief.</p>
<p>Dan (Allen) had recommended that we work with the State, which is good since
we really don't have any finances. There are a few cuzzins that may be willing
to chip in some, but I have no idea if it would be a successful fundraiser. I've
contacted Nick Fielder who was really glad to know about this. He wants to do
the unearthing in October (after the chiggers and tics are gone). Therefore, if
we need deeper readings and help with the grave locations, we could ask Dan what
the charge would be.</p>
<p>The list of FOUR persons buried there
mentioned by Mr. Fred is likely correct. Richard and
Mahala probably lived in the cabin last and he definitely farmed that land. However,
I believe that Elijah's *presumed* eldest son, Samuel, and Sam's wife, Margaret,
might also be buried there. Samuel had relocated to Missouri as a schoolteacher
for only a few years before dying, and there is NO cemetery record in the entire
Bootheel of Missouri with their names. The best thing would just be to dig out
the ditch, see what shows up first, and go from there.</p>
<p>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE STONE I FOUND IS A PEDESTAL
FOR A MEMORIAL. (we could
not dig it out enough with sticks to turn it while I was there)</p>
<p>As Mr. Hawkins points out, the place was called Blocker's shop, which far
outlasted &quot;Winnsboro.&quot; Elijah's father-in-law, Richard Winn, had 5,000
acres which made up possibly all of what is now Sawdust. The sawmill was a much
later thing, as Winn and Elijah came from S. Carolina to finally occupy the land
about 1812, 6 yrs before Winn died. Elijah was about 20 when he married
Winn's daughter Priscilla. There is no marriage recording in Maury County, so
they probably married in S. Carolina, and then migrated in there in 1812. Elijah was a
Captain in the War of 1812, so things didn't really settle down until after
that.</p>
<p><u>Wayne Austin:</br>
</u>According to Jill Garrett Sawdust was once called Winnsboro or Winntown
after General Richard Winn. Evidently George W. Kinzer had a sawmill there about
1870 that brought about the name Sawdust. Jill just says Sawdust was founded in 1870 by
Geroge W. Kinzer. However I think I remember reading somewhere about a sawmill being
the base reason for the name.</p>
