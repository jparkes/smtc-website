  CEMETERY, SOUTHPORT, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

  <b>GARRETT, J. S., 30 Nov
  1830 - 27 Feb 1892. Mason. Inscription: "J. S. GARRETT, BORN NOV. 30,
  1830, DIED FEB 27, 1892. HE FOLLOWED VIRTUE AS HIS TRUEST GUIDE, LIVED AS A
  CHRISTIAN, AS A CHRISTIAN DIED." This is the most stable of the stones in
  the cemetery and the only one in no danger of falling. It is made of
  quality Granite stone, very durable but a bit hard to read since they
  inscribed it very shallow and the color variation causes the lettering to
  blend into the stone.<br/>
