  <b>HUBBELL, Mary J.
  (Garrett), 24
  Feb 1816 - 12 Sep 1892. 76-06-18. �Wife of N. B. Hubbell.� Inscription:
  &quot;MARY J. Wife of N. B. HUBBELL, Born Feb 24, 1816 Died Sep 12, 1892, Age
  76 Yrs 6 Mo &amp; 18 Days. This inscription is on the opposite side of where
  the inscription of N. B. Hubbell on the same stone. The stone is dangerously
  close to falling. When it does it is likely to cause breakage of the parts.
  Amazing story here is that the tree has actually caused the stone to remain
  standing longer than it normally would under the constant assault of the
  cattle rubbing against it. <i>Photo &amp; info by Wayne Austin 4/7/04.</i></p>
