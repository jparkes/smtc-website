may be found from Campbellsville Pike by going southeast on Tol Dugger Road to Wiley Hollow
Road &amp; turning right. From there go about 3 tenths of a mile and when the
road begins to bend look to your left about 200 yards over into the Grove of
Trees. There are old farm &amp; auto scrap iron piles all around on private
land including a trailer for an eighteen wheeler in front of the grove of trees
where the cemetery is located. &nbsp;Cattle ranching is going on around the
cemetery and no fence is there to protect the stones. Cattle are brushing up
against the stones and causing them to fall. One by one the massive monuments
are falling. Each time I go by there more of the memorials are fallen. I believe
only two are standing now and one of those is very close to falling. After they
are all on the ground the next thing that is going to happen overtime is the
stones will sink below the ground because they are so much heavier than the
soil. This may take 40 to 50 years depending on the soil type and then there
is no more cemetery. Everyone then wonders what happened to the cemetery. Well the
farmer was at fault. Right? Yes, but the people the most at fault are the kin
and public who show no interest in their relatives and heritage in banding
together to stop the degradation. The stones would have fallen anyway
without attention to stabilize them. In fact, I am sure some of the stones fell
without help from the cattle.&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></B> </P>
