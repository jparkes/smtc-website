  This stone is
  dangerously close to falling. When it does it is likely to cause breakage of
  the parts. Also it could injure the cattle roaming freely if they are near
  there and cause the fall. This needs urgent attention. The stone will have to
  be lowered to the ground and the tree cut and then the stone leveled and
  reassembled upright. However none of this will matter if a fence is not put in
  place to keep the cattle out.<br>
