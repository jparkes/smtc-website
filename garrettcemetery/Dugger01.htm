  <b>DUGGER, W. J., (William
  Johnson) 12 Feb
  1855 - 11 Oct 1893. (TS fallen.) Jack Dugger writes in &quot;History of the
  Dugger family&quot;: Obviously I never had the opportunity to know my
  grandfather since I was born in 1918, but I did know my grandmother Dugger who
  died in 1923 in our home in Southport near this graveyard. She is buried in
  Rose Hill Cemetery and was a small, wiry, witty, character who smoked a clay
  pipe with a long cane stem. She stayed a long ways from tobacco. Ha! Ha!&nbsp;</br>
  Fallen stone in danger of sinking below the surface and being lost. <i>Photo &amp;
