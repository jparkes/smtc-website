  <b>Garret Cemetery can be found in that clump 
  of trees marked with a red check. It is in severe danger from the farmer 
  allowing the cattle to knock over the monuments. Cattle use the tombstones as 
  a scratching post and this knocks them over and breaks them. If it weren't for 
  the cattle the weeds and trees would take over the cemetery and over time 
  become as much or more of a threat to the tombstones than the cattle. So all 
  cemeteries require maintenance, but few rural ones are getting that.
