  <b>DUGGER, Joda M., 19 Oct
  1886 - 9 Sep 1892. 05-11-10. �Son of G. C. &amp; E. E. Dugger.� George
  Caleb Dugger married Elizabeth Ellen Thurman. (Three Duggers married three
  Thurman sisters). George and Elizabeth moved to Lawrence County and reared a
  large family. I cannot find anything to identify Joda Dugger but the dates of
  births and deaths allow Joda to be a son of George and Elizabeth before they
  moved to Lawrence County Tennessee. George Caleb was a brother of William
  Johnson Dugger also buried here. <br/>
  Fallen stone in danger of sinking below the
  soil surface and being lost. <i>Photo &amp; info by Wayne Austin 4/7/04.
