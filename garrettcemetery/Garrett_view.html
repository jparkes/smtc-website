CEMETERY, SOUTHPORT, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

view looking into the Garrett Cemetery from just on the northern edge. There
aren't many of the memorials&nbsp; still standing. The large gray monument in
the center is of Mr. J. S. Garrett and the memorial of N. B. Hubbell &amp; wife
Mary J. just right and back of that next to a tree is dangerously unbalanced and
ready to topple. We should fix it by (1) centering it or (2) to reduce the risk
of breakage lye it on the ground before it falls. Don't ask me to explain the
large trailer in the background but it is on private property. </br>
While I was in
this cemetery photographing the stones a friendly enough Black Angus Bull with a
large propensity for curiosity decided he would invade my space. He came
rambling up and stopped about 5 feet from me with the funniest look on his face.
It was a look as though he just did know what to think about a human being there
in the cemetery. I used my usual eloquence with animals to coach him to go about
his business and eventually when I ignored him long enough he did amble off to
greener pastures. When I was wrapping up and safely across the fence by the
truck Mr. Bull decided he did not like things as they were and began to bellow and paw the
ground. Being a student of fascination for animal behavior I wondered why he
awaited that long to get mad and do what bellowing bulls do best, but I sure was
glad he waited because those skinny looking trees don't look too inviting to
climb. </span></p>
