  <b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">GARRETT, J. S., 30 Nov
  1830 - 27 Feb 1892. Mason. Inscription: &quot;J. S. GARRETT, BORN NOV. 30,
  1830, DIED FEB 27, 1892. HE FOLLOWED VIRTUE AS HIS TRUEST GUIDE, LIVED AS A
  CHRISTIAN, AS A CHRISTIAN DIED.&quot; This is the most stable of the stones in
  the cemetery and the only one in no danger of falling. It is made of
  quality Granite stone, very durable but a bit hard to read since they
  inscribed it very shallow and the color variation causes the lettering to
  blend into the stone.<br>
