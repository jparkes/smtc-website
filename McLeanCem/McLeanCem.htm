</font>
</b><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">This cemetery is
located on the old Santa Fe Pike, just east of the Snow Creek Road. It was located
on the back of Clarence Woody place in 1987 on the hill behind the barn when Mr.
Fred Hawkins visited there. <o:p></o:p>Today it is located on James Woody's
place. We had previously reported here that this cemetery was also known as the
Vestal Cemetery. Actually the Vestal Cemetery was located across the creek
northeast of this place about 375 yards but it was bulldozed by a previous owner
(now deceased). Mr. Mitchell owns the place today.</font></p>

Lightfoot and Evelyn B. Shackelford, 29 Oct 1961, p B-30, in “They Passed This

1961 saw and stated in their publication that the large pile of rocks was near
the William McLean box tomb and that McLean’s memorial was some distance away
from the other stones.<o:p></o:p>(I can say about 30 feet from the nearest one.
