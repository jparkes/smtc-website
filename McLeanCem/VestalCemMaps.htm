<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">VESTAL
CEMETERY (lost), SANTA FE MAURY, COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;<br>

The above cemetery with the red check is labeled Vestal Cemetery incorrectly. This is actually the
McLean Cemetery. The Vestal Cemetery was on the hill northeast of the Mclean
Cemetery
about 375 yards probably in that high spot on the map above shown as a brown oval. I have a blue arrow pointing at it.&nbsp;<br>
 I am told there was once a fence row across that hill and the cemetery
was in the fence row but the fence row was bulldozed and the stones
covered up by a now deceased previous land owner whom James Woody did not name. </font>
</b><font size="2" color="#000080"><b> Mr. Mitchell owns the place today, but
obviously bears no responsibility for the previous owners actions. Mr. Woody has lived there all his life.
Mr. Woody said the Vestal Cemetery was at one time located along
a fence row and the owner just bulldozed and covered the stones without
question.</b></font><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br>

<b><font color="#000080" size="2">Again, if I had to pinpoint where they would have put
the lost Vestal cemetery I would say on that hill top shown as a brown oval on
the above map pointed out by the blue pointer. I can't be certain because there
is no way to tell where the fence row was located from this map.</font></b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/McLeanCem/VestalCemAerial.jpg" width="997" height="461"><br>
