<p align="center"><b>VESTAL
CEMETERY (lost), SANTA FE MAURY, COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
This cemetery was at one time
located on old Santa Fe Pike, just east of the Snow Creek Road. Today it lies
somewhere under the soil on Mr. Mitchell's place. Keep an open mind that someday
soil erosion will reveal the stones from the soil and the inscriptions
can then be known. The Vestal Cemetery was on the hill northeast of the Mclean
Cemetery about 375 yards until many years ago. I am told there was once a fence row across that hill
and the cemetery was in the fence row. It is said the fence row was bulldozed
and the stones covered up by a now deceased previous land owner whom Mr. James Woody
did not name. Mr. Mitchell owns the place today, but bears no responsibility for
the previous owners actions. Mr. Woody, an alert and intelligent person with a
deep history of the neighborhood had lived there all his life.<br/>
<br/>
No one knew which Vestal family was interred in this cemetery but since
it is adjacent to the Mclean Cemetery, likely it would somehow involve Aaron
&amp; Elizabeth Sparkman Vestal who are the parents of Mrs A. J. Dawson. Mrs
Dawson is interred just southwest across the Fitzgerald Branch Creek in the
Mclean Cemetery.<a href="VestalCemMaps.html"><br/>
