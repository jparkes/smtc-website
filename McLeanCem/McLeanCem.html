<p align="center"><b>McLEAN CEMETERY, SANTA FE MAURY, COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;</br>

</b>This cemetery is
located on the old Santa Fe Pike, just east of the Snow Creek Road. It was located
on the back of Clarence Woody place in 1987 on the hill behind the barn when Mr.
Fred Hawkins visited there. <o:p></o:p>Today it is located on James Woody's
place. We had previously reported here that this cemetery was also known as the
Vestal Cemetery. Actually the Vestal Cemetery was located across the creek
northeast of this place about 375 yards but it was bulldozed by a previous owner
(now deceased). Mr. Mitchell owns the place today.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Some
family history on the Mclean family</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1804 Ephraim McLean Sr.
was living in Christian County Kentucky. McLean received at least two grants of
5,000 acres each in Maury County.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
also acquired grants in the Western District of Tennessee on the Obion River.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Today that is probably in Obion or Lake County Tennessee up in the
northwest part of Tennessee. Ephraim Sr. McLean returned to Kentucky and
remained there until about 1806.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
August 1807 Ephraim McLean, Sr. and five of his sons, one being William McLean,
signed petitions asking the Tennessee State Legislature to establish a new
county (Maury) from parts of Williamson and Dickson Counties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>William McLean was the 9th great Uncle of Mary Bob McClain Richardson
(the writer/compiler).Ref:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Commentary
and Sources</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>First listed by Marise P.
Lightfoot and Evelyn B. Shackelford, 29 Oct 1961, p B-30, in �They Passed This
Way�. Marise &amp; Evelyn mentions that the McLean cemetery is just across the
field and in back of the Williams Cemetery. Marise &amp; Evelyn during
1961 saw and stated in their publication that the large pile of rocks was near
the William McLean box tomb and that McLean�s memorial was some distance away
from the other stones.<o:p></o:p>(I can say about 30 feet from the nearest one.
