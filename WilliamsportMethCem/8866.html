DUNGAN, Lillis, 2 Jan 1805 - 1 Dec 1846. Age 42 years. "Wife of N. Dungan."<br/>
Inscription is crumbling badly here. I can read DUNGAN, DIED, 2. I also see
"IN memory of" . . . "LILLIS", Footstone has initials L. D..
We are matching this up to prior researchers Lillis Dungan, but taking issue
that the surname is Dungan instead of Duncan. Also the given name is Lillis instead of Lellis. Took about 5 photos and none of
them are readable. Inscription is mostly intact. The white &amp; black lichen
spots override some imagery we get of the inscription. This stone can still be
read with proper effort.  Ref: <a href="JBAWood@msn.com">JBAWood@msn.com</a>)<br/>
