WILLIAMS, Dorothy, 26 Jan 1820 - 20 Sep 1843. &quot;Consort of Edward
Williams.&quot;</br>
</br>
</font>Edward Williams who 
is buried in Rose Hill, had 19 children by several marriages. Two of Edward's 
wives are listed in Williamsport Methodist Church Cem:</br>
</br>
(1) Eleanor Elizabeth (Dedman) Williams who died at age 21 after delivering two 
children: William Howard Williams (6 Mar 1846) and Elizabeth Williams (10 Jan 
1848). The son was named for Eleanor's father, William Howard Dedman (burial 
unknown) who married Elizabeth Haile (burial unknown) in Mecklenburg County, VA, 
and moved the family to the Leatherwood Creek area northwest of Williamsport.
</br>
</br>
(2) Dorothy (Darby) Williams (26 Jan 1820-20 Sep 1843) who died at age 23. I 
found one son, Thomas Hamilton Williams.</br>
</br>
(3) I found a third wife, Delilah &quot;Lila&quot; A. McConnico who married Edward 
Williams on 9 Oct 1851. They had one daughter, Lilly B. Williams (b. 1859). I 
have not found &quot;Lila&quot; yet. </br>
</font></br>
</font>Wayne, your photos of the stones of 
Eleanor Williams and Dorothy Williams are quite good. Unfortunately the spires 
on both have toppled.
