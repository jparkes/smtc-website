METHODIST CHURCH CEMETERY, WILLIAMSPORT, (Western) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

Another backside view looking east. These are the newer areas of the cemetery.<br>

The Photographer is moving northward and photographing east at the backside of
the cemetery<br>

One of several prominent homes in historic Williamsport. None of these are open
to the public that I am aware of. This home is adjacent to the cemetery.<br>

From the center of the cemetery shooting east.&nbsp;Notice the Black Lab in the
left part of the cemetery. Since I did not notice this dog at the time I would
say he was coming up quietly and meant the visitor no harm.<br>

Looking west from the center of the cemetery at the back of the Methodist Church
building which centered around much of the history of the interred in this
cemetery. I saw no signs indicating this is still a Methodist Church.&nbsp;<br>

Shooting northeast from inside the cemetery northern area. Many open spaces in
this cemetery as is the case in all the old ones. Old cemeteries tended to
cluster the burials in different areas by broad classes of families.<br>

This shot points at the southwestern corner of the cemetery as does the next up
photo. My suspicion is that the building back behind the cover of trees was once
the original church building since it too is adjacent to the cemetery. It is
obviously a private building now, but would easily be older than the brick
building to our right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Looking east at the Methodist Church building which centered around much of the
history of the interred in this cemetery. I saw no signs indicating this is
