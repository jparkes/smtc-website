<p align="center"><b>PUCKETT
CEMETERY,&nbsp;SMYRNA CHURCH RD., MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

<b>The
cemetery is at Latitude 35 degrees 30.618' North, and Longitude: 86
degrees 54.3' West. Another way of stating that in decimal equivalent is 
35.5103 X 86.905. There is an error in the mapping of this cemetery in the
Delorme Mapping. All other national maps are wrong too. The error is wrong by about 1/2 mile to the west of this
place. That needs to be corrected. Don't know if the error is in the geological
survey or not.</br>

<b>From Scribner's Mill Road going east, 
&amp; before one
crosses I-65, turn left (north) onto Smyrna Church Road. 
Travel north on Smyrna Church Road 
at least a half mile and the road bends back toward the (left) west. 
Immediately after the westward bend you will pass Mr. Warf's place (2008) on the 
left who showed me the cemetery. After Mr. Warf's place go about 500 yards and the road will 
bend back toward the (left again) south. Just before the road bends back left 
there on your right will be a gate into a farm road. Hopefully it won't be 
locked. Go thru that Gate going north on the farm road and down to Silver Creek 
about 400 yards away. Just before getting to the creek turn west continuing 
to follow the farm road due west along the south side of Silver Creek out across 
an open field then back into the woods and the road will then go up a slight incline 
and bend back slightly to the left, The cemetery is behind the rock wall next to 
the farm road. This farm road basically tracks parallel to Silver Creek at first 
and then they bend away from each other. To clarify this a bit more you will 
cross a wet branch that feeds into Silver Creek just after you get back into the 
woods from the open field. Continue on the farm road and it will start up a 
gradual incline then look straight ahead at the cemetery. It will be there 
enclosed in a rock wall reinforced by concrete, but still under the trees.</br>
</br>
I would advise you to walk the distance if you are able, otherwise take a truck 
or 4 wheel drive because the road can get mushy in the winter time or after 
rain. Go about 2 O'clock in the afternoon to get the be there in the driest time of day. As I 
remember we drove down to Silver Creek on the farm road and turned west and 
parked the vehicle and walked the rest of the distance.</br>
</br>
Further clarification: Along the westward part of the farm trail the Silver 
Creek bends back slightly toward the north and the field road bends back also 
slightly south and goes into the woods and climbs up an slight incline. As I 
remember and confirmed by the map the cemetery is just before you get to the old 
barn about 100 yards further southwest. You will only find one inscribed stone as noticed on this site. The old Tobacco barn 
which remains there and the home place was southwest of the cemetery. The Jim &amp; 
Ruby Thomas found a pile of rocks which they thought could have been the 
foundation of the home. It was perhaps serviceable also by the other road coming 
from the south - an extension of 
Smyrna Church Rd. Maybe that little Spring served the Puckett family their 
water. The cemetery is at the highest part on the farm trail after going back 
into the woods. That gives you another way of finding it if the trail is weak. 
Just go parallel to Silver Creek to the highest point and in a place 50 yards south of Silver Creek and 
climb along the south up the highest part of the slight ridge until you come to 
the cemetery.</br>
If you have to walk the whole way after Smyrna Road then park on Smyrna Rd and 
walk straight northwest toward the cemetery across the open field and across the 
branch and you will shave off a great distance over my mapped driving route. 
Just go into the woods and find that triangular open field and cross that and go 
back into the trees then follow west to slightly north and you will be going 
toward the cemetery &amp; 
farm road just north of that.</br>
The owner of this property lives in Nashville. Mr. William Warf
owner of the property south across the road took me to this cemetery. Please 
respect the owners grasses and land and do no harm to the properties nor leave 
gates open.</br>

Since I was judging the place this cemetery is located on this map I could have 
error here so I leave this map with the cemetery about 40 yards further into the 
woods. I do remember from one of the photos there is clearing land just to the 
north of the cemetery. The cemetery is elevated above the surrounding land so 
that is a feature that makes it easier to find even though it is in the woods. I 
now believe this map has the cemetery under the yellow arrow posted too far 
northeast by at least 100 feet.</br>
Having advance permission is always better to visit across private land, 
especially will one need to sign a &quot;waiver of their right to sue the landowner&quot; 
if they are the type that use lawyers to blame everyone else for their clumsiness. 
Yeow!</br>

This Aerial map shows a yellow highlight tracking to the cemetery. That follows
the farm road. There are old abandoned farm buildings standing just northwest of the
cemetery today, a corn crib, small barn and smoke house. The walking path I 
mentioned above may not be allowed by the landowner so may not be feasible. It 
definitely is not part of the right of access to this cemetery. You will not miss 
this cemetery if 
you stay on the farm trail. That takes you right thru the deep woods and up 
beside the cemetery.</br>
