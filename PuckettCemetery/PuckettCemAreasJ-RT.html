<b>One of the 
descendents of the Pucketts' of this cemetery - Ruby Thomas - poses in front of 
the cemetery wall after the long walk to find this lost historical treasure. 
Husband Jim snapped the photo that pleasant Monday 7 Nov 2011.  Her comment: "Edward R. Puckett and Rebecca Westmoreland Puckett

One of the fieldstones that grace this cemetery which causes us curiosity as to 
who may be interred under its long standing burial grounds<br/>

The monument and two other un-carved stones that might at one time marked the

in 1958 when this cemetery was restored.<br/>

Another pose over the grave of her ancestor. 
Thoughts of their hardship and what these old pioneers must have endured were

Another view of the monument. The green spottiness is lichens which is living
