</b>One of the descendents of the Edward &amp; Rebecca Puckett of this cemetery - Ruby Thomas - 
poses after the long walk to find this lost historical treasure. Husband Jim 
snapped the photo that pleasant Monday 7 Nov 2011. Here Ruby is counting her 
blessings that the descendents of the 1958 stepped in and set this monument in 
place to preserve this almost lost burial ground for future generations. Her 
comment: &quot;Edward R. Puckett and Rebecca Westmoreland Puckett are my 4th great, 
grandparents. It felt like a special ground to me.&quot;</font><a href="PuckettCemMaps.htm"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#008000" size="2"><br>

There are several upright fieldstones marking graves. I saw no evidence of an
inscribed memorial prior to the 1958 installation of this stone. Either the old Puckett
memorials were destroyed, removed, and/or buried in place or maybe there never 
were any 
formal headstones. [C Wayne Austin Apr 2008]<br>

</font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Commentary by Ruby Thomas after she &amp; husband 
Jim Thomas visited this site Monday 7 Nov 2011:</font></b></font><b><font size="2"><br>
We had a great morning in our visit. We parked the truck at the bottom of the 
little rise where the road got rough and walked the rest of the way. It was 
wonderful walk &amp; the place and gave me such a good feeling.<br>
We attach some pictures of the burial grounds, the barn and what we think could 
be the original house site. There was a shed and what looked like a smoke house 
near two piles of large rocks. This site is about 60 paces from the barn. The 
burial grounds are 30 paces behind the barn. From where we turned off onto Smyrna 
Church Road to the gate of the farm is one mile.<br>
The wall is about 2 1/2 ft high. The site is shaped like a crown. The east side 
is 12 paces long. Each side goes back 7 paces and then comes in toward the 
center 5 paces and then 5 paces across the west side.<br>
We cleaned around the memorial stone and the what was probably three small foot 
stones. There is another field stone standing to the right of the large stone. 
Leaning on the inside wall could be some more field stones. Those piles of rocks 
are where we think the house site could be. The last building pictured is 
probably the smoke house. <br>
