<b>One of the 
descendents of the Pucketts' of this cemetery - Ruby Thomas - poses in front of 
the cemetery wall after the long walk to find this lost historical treasure. 
Husband Jim snapped the photo that pleasant Monday 7 Nov 2011.&nbsp; Her comment: &quot;Edward R. Puckett and Rebecca Westmoreland Puckett 
are my 4th great, grandparents. Felt like special ground to me.&quot;<a href="PuckettCemMaps.htm"></br>

One of the fieldstones that grace this cemetery which causes us curiosity as to 
who may be interred under its long standing burial grounds</br>

The monument and two other un-carved stones that might at one time marked the

Thoughts of their hardship and what these old pioneers must have endured were
