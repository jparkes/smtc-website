<font color="#008000" size="2">This also looks south toward the road from
farther back into the northern edge of the cemetery. That is the Archibald White
box tomb just partly into the right edge of the photo. Death among children was
so common that they usually reserved a special place in the cemetery for all the
community children.</font><br/>

This view looks south over the upper portion of the cemetery. The John
Williams  box tomb can be seen up next to the <br/>
stump on our left. This photo shows the many open spaces that may contain graves
without memorials.<br/>

We are back looking north at some of the Jones &amp; Booth memorials,  northwest from
the the upper mid area next to the road <br/>
behind the photographer. The batman style memorial was stylish in the 1850s.
Many of them proved to be of bad quality stone<br/>
with a tendency to crumble. That suggest to me that they came from the same
quarry.</font></p>
