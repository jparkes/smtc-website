  MORRISON, Sarah A. Warren, 9 Dec 1840 - 18 Nov 1881, married to John Morrison
  22 Sep 1867. <i>This memorial was found broken. Half (the brown part) of it
  was on the ground below. I set it in place to make the photo and then buried
  the fallen dirty part next to the steel post below to keep the lawn mower from
  breaking it. This memorial is not going to last much longer. The plastic
  splits and burst in the hot summer sun. It is next north to the John D. Warren
  Memorial as can be seen in the photo above. </i><br/>
