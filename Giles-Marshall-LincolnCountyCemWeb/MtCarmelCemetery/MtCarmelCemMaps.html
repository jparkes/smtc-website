This topographical map shows the elevations well and captures Mt Carmel Cemetery
on the hill sloping up to the east.<br/>
Location: From Pulaski take the southern (Hwy 64) bypass and turn left on Bethel
Road (Hwy 166), then right at Stella Sign which is on Stella Road. Next turn right
on Tacketts
Branch Road and go about 1.25 miles and the cemetery is on your right on a slope
or on the north side of the road. (After
turning on Tacketts Branch Rd you will pass the Gooch Cemetery about 1/4 mile
upon a bank above the road also on the right. It will be hard to see from the road though.)<br/>
<br/>
Another version: From I-65 take the Bryson Rd or Exit 6 west to Highway 31 . Go
south (left) on 31 to Elkton and right onto Prospect Road. Stay on 273 and it
becomes Veto Rd then thru Prospect until it turns into Case Rd until it
terminates on Hwy 166. Cross over 166 and the road becomes Edmunson Rd. Go until
that terminates at Stella Rd. Turn north there or right and go to Tacketts
Branch Rd about 3/4 of a mile. Turn left there and go 1.25 miles to the cemetery
upon the side of a slope on the right or north side of the road.  <br/>
