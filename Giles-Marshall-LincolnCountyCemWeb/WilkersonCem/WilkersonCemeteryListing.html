</font>This cemetery is enclosed in a rock
wall about 25 feet by 30 feet. The wall is in reasonable good shape. Mr. Morris
the owner is pleasant and welcomes strangers interested in visiting and the well
being of the cemetery. He allows visits here with notice and respect for fences
and gates. He has some plans to maintain this cemetery, but may welcome your
help. Two very old Cedar Trees mark this graveyard which probably were here in
the early formative years of this family graveyard. Other saplings have sprung
up in recent years and now invade the premises creating a hazard for the
memorials, the graves, and the rock wall. Other than the top fallen from the
Allen Wilkerson memorial, the memorials are all standing. One box tomb is
fractured in the center. A good cleaning is all that is required to make this
cemetery look as it did 100 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
The historic home across the road northwest of the cemetery was occupied by the
Wilkerson family interred here. It is quite historic and architecturally
pleasing. It is thought to have been founded well before the Civil War. It is
well maintained and also is currently owned by a different Morris family who are
cousins of Mr. Morris the cemetery owner.<b><br/>
