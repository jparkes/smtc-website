  Here we have a road map that shows the cemetery off of Highway 166 on Hannah
  Road but labeled as Gunter Smith road above, though I believe it is Hannah
  Road.<br/>

  This aerial map shows the cemetery as a little dark spot on the right about
  300 yards off of Hwy 166 on Hannah Road, pointed out with a yellow arrow. The
  red top home across the road was at one time the old Wilkerson Home, but is
  currently occupied by the Morris family.<br/>
  Official Location: Hwy 64W, right into Campbellsville Road, after about 3
  miles turn east into Hannah Road. The cemetery is across from what was the
  Wilkerson Home at the top of the hill. Please get permission from Mr. Morris
  before visiting this cemetery and you will be welcomed if your intentions are
  honorable.</b></font><b><font size="2"><br/>
