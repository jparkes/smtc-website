Resolutions on the death of H.D. McAteer � Our deceased comrade, H.D. McAteer 
departed this life on the 18th day of August, 1912 in this Marshall county<br/>
at his home in Lewisburg, Tenn. He was born in what is now Marshall county on 
the 26th day of March 1836 and was reared and trained on a farm in said county.<br/>
He enlisted in the Confederate army on May 13, 1861 and joined company C which 
was incorporated in the 17th infantry regiment Tennessee volunteers. He served<br/>
in that company and regiment though its many campaigns until the closing the war 
as a private soldier surrendering and was paroled on the 26th day of April 1865.<br/>
He was seriously wounded one time in front of Petersburg, Va. June 1864 just 
before the surrender of General Lee's army and was not able for duty any more 
until the close.<br/>
<br/>
He was twice married, the first time to Miss Bills who died leaving sorrowing 
her sad husband and three children, two sons and one daughter. His last wife was 
Miss Lizzie<br/>
Beverly. He made a good and peaceable citizen during all his life and joined 
Dibrell Bivonac and camp May 21, 1904 and made a good member always attending 
its meetings<br/>
when he could and was enthusiastic in the discharge of his duties as such. His 
second wife died April 21, 1910 leaving him alone except his children some of 
whom have<br/>
moved to other states, only one daughter living with him at his death.<br/>
<br/>
Wherefore be it resolved that While it is the lot of us all to die yet we deeply 
deplore his death and tender our sincere sympathy to his bereaved children and 
near relatives<br/>
and friends, that copy of these resolutions be published in the Lewisburg 
Tribune.- W.W. Walker, W.F. Finley.<br/>
