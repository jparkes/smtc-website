BEAR CREEK CHURCH CEMETERY, BEAR CREEK, MARSHALL COUNTY TENNESSEE, near

</b><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#000080">Back in 2008 when I 
visited this cemetery I parked the car at the gate to the right of way and 
plodded up the hill to the cemetery.&nbsp; The old Bear Creek Cemetery was about 
400 yards from the nearest house north &amp; up into the woods on top of a hill. In 
the distance I heard a big dog barking, but he made no effort to come toward me. 
I assumed I was too far from his house for him to attempt an attack. I arrived 
at the cemetery and began the photography work. <br>
After about 10 minutes the dog started barking again. This time he barked then 
advanced a few yards closer up the hill and repeated that again. He kept 
approaching toward me barking and coming up the hill, getting closer and closer. 
I could not see the dog but he sounded big and mean like a Doberman. I had nothing to defend 
myself with, so I set about locating the biggest stick I could find. Found one 
that was a light Cedar stick, but hoped it would work if needed. Very soon the big dog 
was within about 150 yards and still advancing up the hill, barking, and getting 
more vicious sounding. I scanned the area for safe places, thinking 1st about 
shinning up a tree. No such tree around me, so I found the tallest tombstone 
monument. The one selected was a solidly built obelisk with a flat top. I 
climbed upon the top and stood there standing and doing a balancing act. Soon it 
dawned on me if I kept standing I would become unbalanced and topple off. So I 
sat down with my feet hanging 2 feet lower. Then I realized I was not really out 
of reach of a big dog, and the stone was still in danger of falling and/or so 
was I. So I jumped back down and stood with my back to the stone wielding the 
stick in the direction of the advancing dog. The dog growling and snarling by 
now drew within about 50 yards of my fortress and as quickly as all the bluffing 
started, it stopped. He turned around, and trotted back toward his distant home 
as quietly as if nothing happened. I immediately set about learning to breath 
again as I cast the stick aside and went back to work. That was one dog I never 
understood. He was far away from his house and never should have taken on a 
stranger 400 yards in the distance, but it proves one thing in the end he knew 
better than to attack in that instance though I do not know how much harm I 
would have brought to him in that situation.<br>
