To find this cemetery from Culleoka take Lewisburg highway and go one mile
beyond the county line. Turn south on Bear Creek Rd. and go one and one half
mile to the historic Bear Creek Church. The cemetery is on your right upon the hill
in a grove of trees across the road from the church. Standing in front of the
church building on the road go 400 yards further on the road and there will be a
gate that goes into a field road up the hill. Go up that hill in a northwesterly
direction to the cemetery about 300 yards from the road.<br/>
