View looking north from the Partenheimer memorial (on our lower left) further into the
cemetery. We are near what was once the gate (at our back) no longer standing.<br/>

<b>This view was taken standing at the gate
looking north into the cemetery. Notice the livestock path formed when they
follow each other around. They all follow single file over the same path which
causes the formation of a muddy path about 1 foot wide. Cattle &amp; horses
damage the stone when they scratch their hides against the stones to relive an
itch. That in time dislodges the stones and they fall. They rarely step on the
stones (goats &amp; sheep do though) unless the stone is flat &amp; low on the ground.
Most of the old stones shown here have a base that extends deep into the ground,
thus they are not as susceptible to falling as the tall spire style stones.
Spires became popular after the 1870s. These stones fall with very little
intervention.<br/>

Looking back west up the hill at the Gupton, Lowrance &amp; Moore memorials. The
small white stone in front with the pointed ears belongs to that of Jacob
Lowrance, an American Revolutionary Soldier, born in 1759. Someone should take
up the task of getting one of those (free) Veteran memorials for him.</b></font></p><p></p>
