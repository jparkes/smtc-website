</i>LOWRANCE, Rebecca, 1766 - 1852. (Badly shaled.) (No readable inscription.
All of these stones I have seen of this style have a death date from abt 1851 to
1858 around southern Maury and western Marshall County. They are all crumbling
too. This and the fact that this is next to the Jacob Lowrance memorial with the
same traits leads me to conclude it is the memorial for Rebecca Lowrance. Jacob
has the same style memorial and he died in 1855. The footstone lying on our left
does not belong to this memorial. It is out of place. It is of the 1880 to 1910
style footstone. Probably for Catherine C. Gupton as the initials C. C. G. can
be seen and Catherine's memorial can be seen (round top) back in the photo
above.<i> <br/>
<font color="#800000">This style stone in this area of the country is rampant
with structural failure. I know of others who have this type memorial who died
about the same time and with the same shape stone.  Their stones are
crumbling just as badly or worse. </font></i></b><b><br/>
