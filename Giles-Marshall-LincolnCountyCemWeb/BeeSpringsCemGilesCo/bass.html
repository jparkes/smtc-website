John Henry Bass, 83, service station operator in the Bunker Hill community, was 
found dead Tuesday morning, March 11, at his home. It is suspected that he died 
early Monday night from a heart attack, as he had suffered from the ailment for 
a number of years. A member of his family visited him Monday night, taking him 
some food for his supper.<br/>
Funeral rites were held at 2 o'clock Wednesday afternoon at the Bunker Hill 
Methodist Church, conducted by the Rev. Carl Holloway, pastor of the church. 
Burial took place in Bee Springs Cemetery.<br/>
Born in Giles County on March 13, 1868, he was the son of the late George Bass 
and Ann Holbert Bass. He had been a member of the Methodist Church since his 
youth.<br/>
Mr. Bass never married.<br/>
The survivors include two sister, Mrs. Mollie Stevenson, Bodenham, and Mrs. 
Sidney Mitchell, Bunker Hill; and two brothers, Clyde Bass, Flintville, and O. 
B. Bass, Bunker Hill.<br/>
Tony Rainery, Ardmore, Funeral Director.<br/>
