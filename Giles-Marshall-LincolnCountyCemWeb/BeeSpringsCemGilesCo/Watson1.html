William E. Watson was nicknamed Gravy. Why, I do not know. His grandson Eugene 
Watson remembers his grandfather and relates this story "It was cold and snowy 
day during the Civil War, Gravy and some of the other soldiers came across a 
clothesline where a woman hung her laundry. There was a pair of socks hanging on 
the line. Gravy took the socks of the line. He was asked by the others why he 
was taking the socks. He said "Well, my feet are cold and she can knit another 
pair.' Eugene Watson gave me a copy of the picture attached. William is wearing 
his Civil War medal. Williams father was James Watson. His grandfather was 
William Watson. This William was one of the early settlers of Giles county on 
Indian Creek and Bunker Hill around 1809.<br/>
Mary Emily Rowe Watson was the daughter of Miles Rowe born 1826 in Giles Co. and 
Mary Frances Stovall born 1832 in Giles Co.. Her grandparents, Joseph Rowe born 
1775 &amp; Mary Asa Carden born 1790 in SC. Her great grandparents Joseph Rowe born 
? in Ireland &amp; Jane Paige born ca 1722 in Ireland. Jane is believed to be the 
first burial at Bee Springs Cemetery in 1822. There are conflicting stories 
about where Joseph Rowe h/o Jane died. Some say he died on the ocean coming to 
America.<br/>
