  This map from Google shows the GPS coordinates of the Wray Cemetery as found

  From Elkton in Giles County take Baugh 
	Road which is one of the east/west streets in the Elkton village and go 
	east. Travel for about 3 miles crossing over I-65 and turn north on Eagin 
	Cemetery Rd aka Adams Road. Follow that for about 6 tenths of a mile and and 
	there will be a fork in the road. Take the left fork which is Eagin Cemetery 
	Road (the right fork is Adams Rd) and go about 3 tenths of a mile to the 
	Railroad tracks. Cross over the tracks and stop. With permission follow the 
	field road to the left thru the gate and on out into the open field to 
	finish the walk to the distant three studded thicket of Wray Cemetery. 
	The cemetery is inside that oblong thicket. The location description given in 
	the book (195) is this: Location: Hwy 31S, left at Elkton School, Baugh Station to 
	Kelly Creek, on Rudus Evans' farm, but that version is historical and not so 
	useful.<br/>

  This aerial view shows the Cemetery in a green (tree) thicket out in a large 
	field just SE of the Elk River and north of the snaky Kellys Creek. I have 
	drawn a yellow graphic path for you to follow. <u>However, David Walker 
	later informed me the best way to walk to the cemetery is thus</u>:  
	Leaving from Eagan Cemetery Road, cross the railroad tracks and walk down 
	the southerly path  (face left) parallel to the tracks, and 
	over/through the gate; then on to the tree grove containing Wray Cemetery.<br/>
