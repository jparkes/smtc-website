Lynnville, GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE</font><br/>
<font color="#000080"><br/>The Pulaski (TN) Citizen, Wednesday, January 20, 
1937 (*researched by Ruth Hasten Walsh)<br/>
On Jan. 8th just before the dawn of morning (January 9) light the death angel 
was winding its way through the portals of Pulaski Hospital, to bear on the 
wings of mercy the dear little spirit of Dorothy Lou Daniel, the darling little 
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. M. L. Daniel.<br/>
Little Dallie, as she was known by friends and loved ones, was two years and 
eleven months old. The lonely parents carried their precious darling for an 
operation three weeks before her death. At first after her operation she was 
thought to be getting along well, but relapsed.<br/>
She leaves to mourn her passing her parents; four sisters, Elizabeth, Fannie, 
Bertha and baby sister, Mildred Jean; two brothers, Morris and Mitchell; 
grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Woodard of near Lynnville and a host of 
friends and relatives.<br/>
She was laid to rest in Lynnwood Cemetery Saturday (sic - Sunday, December 10).
