Webster/Reynolds was the wife of William D. Reynolds &amp; dau.-in-law of Olevia. section D<br/>
</font><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br/>
</font><tt><font face="Courier New" size="4">I (Robert)found Alice Gertrude 
WEBSTER-REYNOLDS' husband, William D., in<br/>
a cemetery in Riverside County, CA, the Mountain View Cemetery, aka,<br/>
Beaumont Cemetery in Beaumont, CA.  He and some of his daughters and their<br/>
spouses are buried there.  He died July 18 1955.<br/>
<br/>
William D. was one of the 22 family claimants who went to Muskogee, I.T.<br/>
and filed for benefits from the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes. <br/>
He was 27 at the time, stating that both his parents, Thomas C. and<br/>
Olevia, had died, she four years earlier (testimony given January 2,<br/>
1902).  He was married to Alice and had a twenty month old daughter Lillie<br/>
Mai.  He provided a "paper" from Dan L. Eslick, Clerk of the County Court<br/>
of Giles County, TN to the effect that on the 8th day of August, 1899, a<br/>
marriage license was issued to W. D. Reynolds and Alice G. Webster and<br/>
said were married on that date by Robert S. Brown, Minister of the Gospel.<br/>
 When question further as to how many years his parents lived together as<br/>
man and wife, he replied twenty odd years and how many children his<br/>
parents raised, he replied seven.<br/>
<br/>
I found this interesting because we had documented five children, his<br/>
parents were married before the 1860 census and had a 4 year old son (he<br/>
also testified at this hearing), at time of 1860 Census, and that Thomas<br/>
C. had died in 1889 and Olevia had died in 1898.  Son Thomas T. had died<br/>
in 1899 and that would leave two other children to account for.  2nd birth<br/>
occurred in Feb. 1862 and next in 1870 and then 1872 and then 1878.  Now<br/>
to figure which gap to look for "missing Children", ignoring Civil War period.<br/>
