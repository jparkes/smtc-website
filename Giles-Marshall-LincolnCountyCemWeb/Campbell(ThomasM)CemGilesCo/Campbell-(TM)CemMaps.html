Location: Go 
west on Highway 64 (toward Lawrenceburg) from Pulaski and turn north on 
Campbellsville Rd (Hwy 166). Go about 8 miles and up the hill and turn left on 
Wales Estate Road. Follow that almost to the end about 2 tenths of a mile 
and the cemetery is on the left. This is just to the right of the next to last house 
near the 
road. Currently it rest among a salvage yard and is hard to identify from the 
Salvage items. At one time the main road went closer to this cemetery and stayed 
in the valley. Phelps Cemetery was just west of the road. It connected back into 
what is now Wales Estate Road then merged with the current Hwy 166 continuing 
northward. See 1940s US Geological Topographical survey maps to verify this. 
While it is definitely true this land owner/leaser is abusing the quality of 
this cemetery beauty. I cannot see that any of the monuments or the fieldstones 
have been hit or knocked over when I was there.<br/>
