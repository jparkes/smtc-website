This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Whitaker-Moores Cemetery as N 35.14795 X W 
-86.73118. Do not use the Google GPS for this cemetery or the USGS. Those will 
cause a 300 yard error to the northwest.<br/>

From Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 to Old Elkton Pike aka Hwy 273 and turn 
south (left). Follow that for about 8+ miles to the junction of Cunningham 
Hollow Rd (on your right) and Hwy 273. The cemetery is across the junction on 
the south side (your left) side of the road upon a hilltop in the woodland. 
There is a mostly cleared field on that side of the road that follows along the 
fence row next to the woods. With permission go into the thicket and start up 
the slope and cross the fence and into the mostly open field. Continue climbing 
the hill following the fence row and when you reach the top of the hill start 
down the back side. When you see a small pond on your left that is usually dry 
turn right (south) and cross the fence (without damaging it) and go into the 
woods. The cemetery should be into the woods about 40 yards from the fence row. 
The distance to the cemetery from the Hwy is about 300 yards or something less 
than 2 tenths of a mile.</b></font></p>
