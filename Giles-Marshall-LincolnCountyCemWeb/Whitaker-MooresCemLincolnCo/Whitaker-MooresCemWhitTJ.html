<b><font color="#CC3300" size="2">Thomas J. Whitaker, citizen and farmer of the 
Thirteenth District, was born in Lincoln County April 23, 1823, and is one of a 
family of seven children born to Benjamin and Mahaldah Whitaker. He is the 
grandson of John Whitaker, who built the first gristmill in Lincoln County. He 
was the first chairman of the county court, and will be remembered by many of 
the oldest citizens now living in the county. The father of our subject was born 
in Kentucky, and came to Lincoln County with his parents at a very early day. He 
was a farmer by occupation, and died in the Eighth District September 12, 1869, 
being over eighty years of age. The mother is supposed to be a native of 
Georgia, and died about 1840. Our subject received a good, practical education 
in the common schools near home, and in 1847 was married to Elizabeth R. Moores, 
a native of Lincoln County, Tenn., born November 19, 1821, and died November 30, 
1880. By this union six children were born, four of whom are living: W. N., M. 
E., Susan &amp; Dora. In 1847 our subject bought 167 acres of land in the thirteenth 
District, where he has since resided. The place is pleasantly located, well 
improved, and is near Fayetteville-Elkton road, twelve miles west of 
Fayetteville. <br>
