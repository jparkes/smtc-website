<u>BARBER, Martha B. Mosley The Pulaski Citizen 09 Jan 1924<br/>
<br/>
</u>Mrs. Robert Barber died January 1st at her home her, age 74 years. She was a 
member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church for many years. She was a good 
woman and loved her home, and was one that you never heard any one speak a word 
against. So when you find a person like this, you have found a precious jewel 
which is one in a thousand. She leaves one son, Bela Barber, who is a good, 
substantial citizen and neighbor. Funeral services were conducted at Rehoboth by 
Rev. W. A. Stroud who made an appropriate talk on a mother and her love. Burial 
at Marks graveyard. <br/>
