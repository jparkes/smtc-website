<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#800000">Notes:<br>
Four Brown sisters or in-laws (don't know which) came to Giles Co in early times 
to live there and nothing much is known. One married a Knight it seems. They 
sold their slaves to C.E. Reed's grandfather. They were relations of that early 
Brown family in southern Giles Co that became very prominent in Tennessee 
History, two of which served as Governors of the state. Still their small 
graveyard was destroyed by neglect &amp; un-thoughtful people.<br>
<br>
What I found here was a completely destroyed graveyard. No stones were standing. We are left 
only with fragments of tombstones and most of those were dug from deep 
into the ground. I am sure there were other fragments, but it was difficult 
digging among the tree roots to find them. This was all located under a lone 
Walnut Tree, perhaps 20-25 years old. Part of a base of a stone was still there. 
I am told land owners in the past used the stones to weigh down their cultivator 
disks when there were plenty of boulders around the area that could have been 
used.<br>
A probe was utilized to uncover several pieces of stones completely 
buried. All were parts of tombstones that were smashed into several pieces many 
years ago by some violet force, probably vandals, livestock, falling trees or 
some combination of these. Couple that with soft limestone composition and these 
stones and this is the outcome.<br>
<br>
A part of a headstone for Martha Brown was found. Another footstone had the 
initials R.K. standing for (Rebecca R. Knight?). Another stone was found with 
bits of inscription for the monument to Elizabeth Brown, nothing else known. 
Another footstone with one initial R remaining on the left side (initial of 
given name, which I believe to part of the footstone for Rebecca R. Knight. This 
cemetery at one time had most of five monuments standing. It should be excavated 
more thoroughly to uncover all the sunken parts of tombstones and reassemble 
them for more inscriptions.<br>
Later I would be told this was an old Slave Graveyard. Well you know the story. 
All &quot;old torn up unmarked graveyards&quot; were slave graveyards to the uninformed 
public. I was not convinced and when I investigated further I found this was the 
Brown-Knight Cemetery in the Giles Co Cemetery Book 1986, by the Historical 
Society. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">My interpretation of 
this cemetery is based on the book Giles County Cemeteries. If they had errors 
then I may have carried them forward. If not we have an accurate translation of 
the inscriptions from the fragments of the tombstones in this cemetery and the 
book in combination. Also some of the translations are based on years of 
knowing what and how a tombstone will be inscribed as they tended to be all be 
inscribed with similar language.</font></b></p>
<p><b><i><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Visited 18 Jan 2017 
on an overcast day 
at about 1 PM in the afternoon. I thought for awhile this may have been the Rich 
Billy Brown Cemetery but not so.&nbsp; Added here on 31 Mar 2017. This cemetery 
was also presented on page 60 of the Giles County Cemetery book about 1985 when 
evidently most of the stones were readable. Not presented on Findagrave.com 
until I added the menu and Martha Brown's listing.</font></i></b></p>
