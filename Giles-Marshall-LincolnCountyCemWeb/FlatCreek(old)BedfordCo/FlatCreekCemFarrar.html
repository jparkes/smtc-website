<p align="center"><font color="#008080" face="Lucida Sans Typewriter">The 5th 
Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry was a Union Army unit (https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/5th_Regiment,_Tennessee_Cavalry_%28Union%29). 
My GG-Grandfather was in action around Murfreesboro and went home (not too far 
away) to visit his family. He was captured at home and spent the rest of the 
Civil War at Andersonville a Confederate Prison.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph H. was the son of Jordan Farrar. Jordan is buried somewhere in Flat 
Creek, but I read somewhere that his grave may have been covered by a road. 
Joseph married his first cousin, Permelia Farrar, also buried at Flat Creek. Her 
father was John Howard Farrar. I believe John Howard Farrar is buried somewhere 
in Arkansas.<br/>
