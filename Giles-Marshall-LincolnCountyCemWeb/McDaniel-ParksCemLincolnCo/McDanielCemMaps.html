From Hwy 50 &amp; Hwy 64 (Lynchburg Hwy) take Hwy 50 for a 1/2 mile and turn left on 
Badenhop Blvd. Go four tenths of a mile and turn left on Providence Road. Follow 
that for about a mile and the cemetery is thought to be in a cow pasture in 
front of two houses and also in front of a pond. I cannot positively say you 
will find this cemetery at this location. The GPS points here and so far that is 
about all I have to go on. However, from the road I did spot some rough rocks in 
the area which is thought be what is left of this cemetery.<br/>

This aerial map shows with a red check the cemetery north of the road. This is 
in front of the pond and in front of the houses shown above. Even if you go here 
you will not likely find anything except scattered field rocks.<br/>
