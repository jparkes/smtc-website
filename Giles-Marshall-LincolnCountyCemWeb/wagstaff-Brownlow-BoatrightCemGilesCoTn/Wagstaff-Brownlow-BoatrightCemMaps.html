This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Wagstaff-Brownlow-Boatright Cemetery 
as N 35.37682 W 87.05519. After permission &amp; access from the owners, the Mark Thurman 
family, your mission is to cross the creek and follow north along the hedge row 
spanning north out from Lynn Creek Rd. There are several approaches but I chose 
the most direct. There are cleared paths and field roads that one can 
follow paralleling that hedge row. 
Obviously get instructions and permission first if this confuses you.<br/>

north on Hwy 31 for 12 or so miles and turn left (west) on Yokley-Waco (Old 
Lynnville) Road. Go abt 1/4 mile and turn left on Lynn Creek Rd. Go just over a mile and the 
residence on the right is of the Mark Thurman family 1684 Lynn Creek Rd.. They have a road that goes back into the woods and open fields. 
However, there are locked gates &amp; a creek to cross so I recommend walking. </b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery marked with a white check inside a yellow 
outline inside a stand of 
trees which is a part of a long tree lined hedge row on private property. There 
are cattle present here that may follow you around. Be aware of their presence 
and do as little as possible to disturb them, but let the Thurmans' advise you 
of that.<br/>
