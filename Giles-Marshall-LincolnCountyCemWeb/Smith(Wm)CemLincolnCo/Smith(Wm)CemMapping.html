This map shows the GPS coordinates of where I believe this cemetery to be 
located. Since I have not been here and can't say for sure I have put checks in other places where I would also look if my first 
suspicions were wrong. I have mapped this for now at N 35.22938 X -86.61852. I 
cannot guarantee the above GPS will find this cemetery because it is just my 
mapping experience in play which is usually right. This cemetery is not mapped 
on United States Geological Survey.<br/>

Location: From 
Fayetteville go northeast on Hwy 431 a few miles and turn left in Howell onto 
Shields Road. Follow that for a half mile and pass Hayes Mill Rd aka Brown Teal 
Road and continue 
north a few more yards until you see Round Square Rd on your left. Take that and 
the cemetery location or clump of trees I have zeroed in on is the most prominent one seen after 
you bend back more north from your northwest direction. That is a clump of 
trees. This is private and cultivated land so you may not be able to get 
here during crop season or without permission.</b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <br/>
