		<br>
		W.T. &quot;Tom Cat&quot; Pillow died suddenly Monday forenoon at the home of a 
		neighbor, Tom Holt, near Vale Mills. Mr. Pillow after spending the 
		night with his daughter, Mrs. George Dodson, in town, started home. The 
		weather was bitter cold Monday and Mr. Pillow was 83 years old. He 
		stopped in at Tom Holt's to warm. And while sitting by the fire enjoying 
		its warmth, collapsed, dying almost instantly. Funeral services were 
		held at the home of Mrs. Dotson in Pulaski, Tuesday afternoon. Services 
		were conducted by Elder Clifford Murphy, followed by burial at Mt Moriah. Mr. Pillow was a tenant farmer having spent the greater part of 
		his life in the neighborhood of Vale Mills and Chicken Creek. In his 
		younger years he had the reputation of being one of the best cotton 
		farmers in the county. He knew how to plant, cultivate, and gather the 
		crop to get good results.<br>
