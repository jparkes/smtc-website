<span style="color: black; font-weight: 700">                William T. 
McCanless died Tuesday night at his home at Young after several weeks illness 
with typhoid fever and complications. The burial occurred at the family 
graveyard yesterday after funeral services by Revs. A. M. Ezell and G. E. 
Eubank. Mr. McCanless was the son of the late Frank McCanless and was a quiet, 
unassuming hard working and God fearing man. He was in his 57th year. He is 
survived by his wife and a little daughter, who have the sympathy of the 
community.</span></p>
