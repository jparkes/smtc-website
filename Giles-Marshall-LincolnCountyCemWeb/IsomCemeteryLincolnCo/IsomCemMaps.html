  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville eastern bypass go 
		north on 231 and after a short distance turn right Old Mulberry Road and 
		follow that for a short distance and turn left on Mimosa Road and follow 
		that several miles. After you pass Golf road on the left go 1/4 mile and 
		turn into the driveway to a house and farm. Cross the creek and continue 
		to go straight bearing out into the field and go straight toward the 
		distant hay storage shed. The cemetery will be on the east side of the 
		shed in the thicket.<br/>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery marked with a red check. You can follow the 
		outlined road above to get to this cemetery though it is further that 
		way. Also the (short) other way may be trampling on someone's hay crop.<br/>

		I have outlined the path in yellow I took to get to this cemetery. I was
