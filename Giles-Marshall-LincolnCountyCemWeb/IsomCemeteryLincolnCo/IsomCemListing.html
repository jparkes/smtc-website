	<p><b>I don't know what the situation is 
	regarding the missing stones of this cemetery. Neither I nor anyone lately 
	have been able to find any monuments to the other folks grouped into this 
	cemetery. Maybe the other stones are located away from the above three 
	monuments and no one saw them. I did look around, but sometimes in these old 
	graveyards stones can be scattered a 100 yards apart with nothing in 
	between. The area of this cemetery is really just a part of a tree lined 
	thicket which extends north and south. One would think all the Isom kin 
	would be found in one area of this cemetery but I cannot conclude that. 
	Either the old historical cemetery listers were capturing the others as 
	unmarked graves or something is amiss here regarding grave locations.
