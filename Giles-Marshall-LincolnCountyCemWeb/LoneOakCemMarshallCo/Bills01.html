<p align="center"><b>LONE OAKÂ  CEMETERY (Lewisburg) MARSHALL COUNTY TN<br/>
</b><b><br/>
BILLS, Jesse S., 1890 - 1950.<br/>
<br/>
I have the "Cemeteries of Marshall County" book pages copied for Lone Oak &amp; I 
actually found Jesse's name listed in Lone Oak. I knew what section he was in 
and the graves surrounding him. However, when I got there I found the 
surrounding graves but it's just bare ground where Jesse was supposed to be 
buried. I thought it was odd.<br/>
It wasn't until I got to Temple Cemetery (Marshall County, TN) &amp; found Kittie's 
grave that I saw that she has a double headstone. I saw "Jesse" on the stone 
with hers &amp; looked at the info I had on Jesse Bills in Lone Oak. That's when I 
realized that this Jesse was the same as the one I had looked for at Lone Oak. 
The only difference in his information was the year of death. The information on 
the headstone reads 1890 - 1950 for Jesse. He died the year before his wife. I'm 
not sure what happened. I don't know if they moved Jesse to Temple when Kittie 
died or if they removed his headstone from Lone Oak when she died because they 
wanted a double stone..... I don't know lambs4lynn@yahoo.com <br/>
Commentary more than likely they wanted the double headstone. [CWA 1 Dec 2012]</b><i><b><br/>
