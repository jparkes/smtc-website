					troubles incident to the infirmities of age. Had Mr. Story 
					lived till the 22nd of February he would have been 85 years 
					old. Joining the Presbyterian Church early in life, he had 
					lived a faithful, consistent member of the same, and had 
					been an elder of that denomination 40 years, and belonged to 
					the Young�s Chapel congregation since its organization. 
					Coming home from the confederate army with an honorable 
					discharge after four years faithful service to his country. 
					He started in life with nothing, but managed by hard work, 
					frugal industry and practical economy to accumulate an ample 
					sufficiency to make life comfortable in his declining days. 
					Mr. Story was born near Spartanburg, S.C., married in 
					Lincoln County, Tenn., and in his death leaves his wife in 
					age and feebleness extreme, and a widowed daughter, Mrs. 
					Alice Fautt, and the following sons: R. L., Hugh, Elmo, R. 
					F., and Richard. His remains were interred at Young�s Chapel 
					with appropriate services by his pastor, Rev. G. H. Turpin.<br/>
