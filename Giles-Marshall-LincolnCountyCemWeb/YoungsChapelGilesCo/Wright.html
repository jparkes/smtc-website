					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 29 Nov 1917<br/>
					<br/>
					On Nov. 17, 1917, Ruby Lee Wright died with membranous 
					croup, after a few hours illness, aged about three years, 
					and was buried at Young�s Chapel, Sunday afternoon. She was 
					the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Wright of Bradshaw. It is 
					not pleasant to stand at the door of an open grave, and hear 
					the wail and sobs of a broken hearted father and mother but 
					they should find consolation in the fact that their little 
					darling has exchanged a home of earthly property for a home 
					of heavenly riches. And if we could all make this change it 
					would be better for us. We sympathize with Mr. and 
					Mrs. Wright in their sorrow.<br/>
