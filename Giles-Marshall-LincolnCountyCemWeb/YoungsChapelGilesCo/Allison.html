					Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 23 Apr 1903 Bradshaw 
					&quot;Evergreen&quot;<br>
					On last Tuesday evening the death angel came and claimed for 
					its victim, little Vera, the four year old daughter of Mr. 
					and Mrs. C. Y. Allison. Vera had been suffering for some 
					time with cancer of the eye, when five weeks ago she was 
					taken to Nashville to have the eye removed, thinking, 
					perhaps she would then recover, but God in his infinite 
					goodness saw fit to remove her from this world of pain and 
					sorrow to her heavenly home. She was laid to rest Wednesday 
					in Chapel Cemetery. Funeral services were conducted by Rev. 
					Carden. We extend our heart felt sympathy to the bereaved 
					family.</font></p>
