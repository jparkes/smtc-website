This road map shows the cemetery at the foot of the west bank of Hwy 64 just 
back from where it merges with the new Pulaski Bypass aka Hwy 64 bypass. This is about 
3 miles 
southeast of of the center of Pulaski.<br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery in the dense thicket at the foot of the 
highway.<i>
</i>You have two choices to get to this cemetery. Climb down the steep highway 
bank (recommended only for mountain people) or go in to the residence shown in 
this view from Owl Hollow Road and get permission to go thru a gate on the right side of the driveway 
and go across the pasture to the cemetery. Carry brush cutting equipment if you 
go because the monument is covered in honey suckle and cow itch vines to an 
extent it is not visible, except within a few feet.<i><br/>
