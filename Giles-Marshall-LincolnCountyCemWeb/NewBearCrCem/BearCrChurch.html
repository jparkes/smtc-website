The church is back from the road on the same side as the New Bear Creek
Cemetery.<br/>
While I have not researched this church it is clearly historic. I see no
evidence
the facility has ever had electricity indicating it was not being used at the
time electricity was installed in the neighborhood in the 1930s. <br/>
The Middle Tennessee State University Historical Preservation Department <a href="../OldBearCreekCemMarshallCo/OldBearCrCemPreservation.html"> has had
a program for preserving this relic in the past</a>. There is a booklet in the Maury
County Archives explaining that.<br/>

Alert: I visited this church building 30 Dec 2005 and all appeared well with the
property. However, while visiting 26 Feb 2008 I noticed the front doors were
standing wide open. I also noticed some glass broken &amp; missing from the
windows. This openness will compromise the building quickly if something is not done.
Birds &amp; insects will take up residence soiling the inside. Also vines are running up the
north side of the brick wall. One deteriorating event will follow another to the
eventual total detriment of the property. Best to repair the broken glass immediately. I
closed the doors but they should be locked and the windows repaired along with
destroying the vines climbing the brick. Maybe a shop vacuum cleaning of the
inside is in order. I would say with proper closure the property is good for a while. The
roof looks solid, but some of the lower window seals may need paint to fend off
decay. <i><br/>
