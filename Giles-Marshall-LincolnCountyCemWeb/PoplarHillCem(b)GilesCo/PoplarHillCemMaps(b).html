This map shows the coordinates of the Poplar Hill Cemetery, known incorrectly as 
Polar Hill Cemetery in some of the mapping industry. The Poplar Hill 
Cemetery (White section) GPS is </b></font></font>
<font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>N 35.03000 W 86.96164. 
The Old Poplar Cemetery (Black section) GPS is: N 35.03017 W 86.96205. and the 
new Poplar Hill (Black) Cemetery GPS is as depicted below: N 35.03174 X W 
-86.96334. OK let there be no more confusion about the Poplar Hill Cemetery<br/>
</b></font><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">As in any old 
Black cemetery it is not proven that the inhabitants of this cemetery were all 
one race. 
Many times whites of long ago started cemeteries and abandoned them as then 
moved off to the west etc. Sometimes 
the cemetery was then taken over by the black community and used even into 
modern times. Unrelated to that is this cemetery was abandoned 
by the black community and restarted at the church north up Old Poplar 
Hill School Road. I am unaware of the why that happened except maybe there is a 
shortage of good lots here due to the land being unlevel and it may have also had 
something to do with moving the church building. This site was a complete 
mess of bushes when I was there. I met and discussed that with the lady who lives across 
the street. She said some of her kin had planned on clearing it, but just 
procrastinated. However, now I see a photo on findagrave.com that shows a 
clearing happened, at least partially.<br/>

From Elkton go west on Prospect Road toward Prospect and turn south on Poplar 
Hill Road. Travel to the junction of Old Poplar Hill School Road and Poplar Hill 
Road and on the left just past the junction find the white cemetery in a clump 
of trees. The black cemetery is on the right in the (dense) thicket in the 
northwest corner of the junction.<br/>
