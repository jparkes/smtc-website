original pioneer family setting up in Lincoln County very early in the 1800s.

There was one partly broken stone protruding from the ground essentially causing 
the necessity to dig out this cemetery from the past or at least what is left of it. I show 
no area photos because this is in the midst of private property. The 
current landowner was only recently notified that this was a cemetery and has 
allowed it to be reclaimed as the Rambo Cemetery or at least the stones to be 
dug out. It is not my nature to hide 
the ugly nature of our human capacity to abuse old cemeteries, though it may not 
be intentional. It is with that position that I show you this cemetery which 
in the past has been designated as a spot to set the trash burning barrel for 
one family.  I was shown this cemetery by Mr. Stevenson from across the 
highway and he has lived about all his life in this area and knew of the 
existence of this cemetery but was not aware it had sunken below the ground. A 
trained eye for identifying what is a fragment of tombstone help out here, even 
when this tombstone history has been largely lost.</font></b></font></p>
