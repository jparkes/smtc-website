									I recently discovered 
									a website for the Phillips Farm which is the 
									property where the Center Church used to 
									stand. <a href="http://jimandmarilyn.com/">
									http://jimandmarilyn.com/</a> There are links on 
									the left for the Church and the cemetery 
									with some history and pictures of the 
									interior, but no explanation of why it is no 
									longer there. I used the email address on 
									the Church page to contact Jim Phillips (who 
									lost his wife Marilyn just last November) 
									and inquired about the old Church building 
									that is no more. Since you expressed concern 
									as to the fate of the building at the bottom 
									of your Center Cemetery page, I knew you 
									would be interested in his reply. The 
									contents of his email are pasted bellow. <i>

										Sorry for the slow response, I am using 
										another email address 
										<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1338218790_0">
										jralph43@gmail.com</span> 
										and just check this one periodically.</font></div>
									<div>
										<font size="3">The building had started 
										to fall apart. The siding was falling 
										off and several windows had fallen out. 
										The remaining brick chimney above the 
										ceiling was unsupported and threatened 
										to fall to the floor. There are also 
										instances in the rural areas near here 
										where vandals have set fire to old 
										vacant church buildings. Possibly the 
										same type rogue that enjoys knocking 
										over tomb stones.</font></div>
									<div>
										<font size="3"><br/>
										The church building itself was taken 
										apart and taken to Cullman Alabama to an 
										architectural antiques dealer 
										</font>

										 Much of the timber has been sold, a few 
										of the pews and other items. The old 
										chandelier was originally advertised at 
										$25,000 but most recently a price of 
										$10,000 was discussed with a buyer in 
										Chicago. Apparently it is the only 3 
										tier kerosene chandelier in the US. It 
										will have to be put in a large building.</font></p></div>
									<div>
										<font size="3"><br/>
										All the money from the sale of the 
										church materials is being put into a 
										cemetery fund. So far none has been 
										spent. All the restoration work in the 
										cemetery has been manually labor and 
										adhesive and bleach. Long range plans 
										for the cemetery include a modest 
										entrance and signage and long range 
										maintenance after I am unable to care 
										for the grounds. I am 68 and have helped 
										care for the cemetery and grounds since 
										I was a teen. </font></div>
									<div>
										<font size="3"><br/>
										One couple has marked off grave plots to 
										be buried there. I am encouraging more 
										of this so there will be new families 
										who can take care of the cemetery after 
										we are gone.</font></div>
									<div>
										<font size="3"><br/>
										We aren't doing much in the way of 
										cemetery restoration other than trying 
										to get the stones back upright, pieces 
										bonded together and some cleaning. We 
										are back in the older graves now and a 
										lot of work needs to be done. We have 
										pretty well picked the low hanging 
										fruit. Decoration is this coming Sunday 
										so I'll spruce it up; although few if 
										any people come any more.</font></div>
