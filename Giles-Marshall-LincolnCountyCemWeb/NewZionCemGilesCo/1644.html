CRUNK, Delia Crunk Tinnon 18 Jan 1861 - 11 Aug 1929.<br/>
This stone could be listed under the surname Tinnon. It appears she was 1st the
wife of J. J. Crunk who died years before and perhaps Delia remarried to ---
Tinnon. Tinnon does not have a tombstone in this cemetery if he was laid to rest
here. <br/>
We are in the old section, on the south side, of the old church building.<br/>
