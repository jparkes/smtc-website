Newton.)<br/>

<p>**Interview with Littie West Newton Williams
Carpenter, born 1917 on 7-2-08, by Wayne Austin, at
her nursing home, out on hwy 64 east of Pulaski. **</p>
<p>The grave heaped up with rocks belongs to her grandfather Jack West.
It is an unmarked grave in New Zion cemetery. Jack West died long before Littie was
born. Jack West was a native of either east or west Tennessee she could not be
sure. He is probably not closely related to Samuel West and his siblings also of
Giles County.<br/>
Littie was born 1917. Her father's name was James (Jim) Terry Newton also buried
in New Zion Cemetery. "Littie was in her thirties when her 92
year old father
died." Based on that the year death date  would have been about 1949 when
her father died. That put him being born about 1857 and dying about 1949. I
suppose that is accurate within 10 years either way. <br/>
"Littie and her family lived in a house in
the middle of a field near New Zion Church."<br/>
Littie's mother was: Cassie West Newton,
16 Oct 1890 - 15 Feb 1932. Buried in the Johns-Hamlin Cemetery.
</p>
<p>Littie married 1st Arthur Williams. 2nd to Alford Carpenter buried in New
Zion.<br/>
Littie had a son named Lester Carpenter and he is interred in New Zion Cemetery
also.</p>
