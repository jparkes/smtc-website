  Mary F. Ferguson. Boxtomb. 17 Jul 2008 photo. We can't seem to get this
  inscription. In 2005 (photo below) there was a large tree lying across the
  tomb. Today most of the tree has decayed,Â  but the tomb is broken and the
  top part with the inscription is lying upside down on our left. It weighs
  about 500 lbs and I am not going to lift it back on without equipment. This
  tomb was not broken in 2005, that is a fresh break. [WA 7/23/2008]<br/>

  FERGESON, Mary F., Oct 23, 1798 - Jul 30, 1859. It is obvious how buried into
  the fallen Cherry tree this memorial is. I don't know if today it is free of
  the limbs but will be shortly thru decay. However the rotting limbs are
  usually replaced by a vigorous growth of brush which becomes equally hard to
  eradicate. This is a vicious cycle.<br/>
