<p align="center">CAMPBELLSVILLE CEMETERY (Campbellsville) GILES COUNTY
TENNESSEE<b><br/>
<img border="0" height="381" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/CampbellsvilleCemGilesCo/Campbellsville1878.jpg" width="332"/><br/>
This 1878 Map of Campbellsville Tennessee shows an H. English as owning the
Clarence Campbell home. Shows the C. Presbyterian Church and a school (Academy just
(below) south of that.) Looks like the big property owners were Dr J. H.
Campbell, H.N. Campbell, H. English, H.S. English, J.H. Cook, J. Yokley, I
Yokley and J. J. Prentice. An A. Baker had just died and left an estate is shown
as A. Baker Estate. A Shoe Shop, Cotton Gin &amp; General Store. Looks like the
roads are about the same but the south part of the village is not shown on this
map including the Campbellsville Cemetery.<br/>
D.H. Hannah can be found on the above map. Dr. J. (James) H. (Henderson)
Campbell was the father of Clarence Campbell. Clarence Campbell didn't purchase
the house shown on this site until around 1894, and he purchased it then from
the English family.....H. English shown above, I guess, perhaps Hugh
English---not sure. I suppose that J. Yokley is Jacob Yokley and I. Yokley is
Isaac Yokley.  <br/>
