<br>
The Barksdale Tombs at the rear of the Educational Building
have attracted much interest because of their location. Mr. O.C. Walker
gives new light on this from an entry in some Old City Minutes dated Nov 25, 
1884.<br>
The entry reads:<br>
<br>
<i><font color="#000080">G. C. Sandusky &amp; B. M. Tillman petitioned the Mayor and Board of Alderman for 
permission to bury Dr. Barksdale and<br>
Wife, when they die, in the Church Yard near the fence separating it from the 
Cowan-Frierson Ground&quot;. After Dr. Barksdale's death in February 23, 1885, Mrs. 
Barksdale operated their large home as a boarding house known as &quot;Barksdale 
house&quot;.</font><br>
<br>
It was located where the Funeral Home now stands (now 1975), a parking lot for 
the Baptist Church).<br>
She followed her Husband in death in 1896. It is presumed that they wished this 
place for their interment because of their intense love for the Church in which 
both were so very active.<br>
