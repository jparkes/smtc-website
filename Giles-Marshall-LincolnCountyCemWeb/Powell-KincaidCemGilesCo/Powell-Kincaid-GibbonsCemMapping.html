Take Hwy 11 from Pulaski going southwest several miles, at Minor Hill turn right into Puncheon Road. 
After 1/3 mile turn back north (right) on Jackson Hollow Road. Follow that 
about 1 &amp; 1/2 miles and turn left (west) on Powell School Road. Go another 1 
&amp; 1/2 miles and the cemetery is about 300 yards south of the junction on your 
left upon a slope above the pond at the junction of Powell School Road and 
Shannon creek Road. The caretaker lives nearby and may be able to grant you 
permission. Access gates are found in the area of the buildings on the Southside 
of Shannon Creek Road seen on the below map. You can see the stones in the 
distance from the road in the winter.</font></b><font size="4"><b><font face="Courier New"><br/>

This aerial map shows a closer view of the cemetery on the side of a slope under a clump of 
trees where the white cross marks the spot. Cows can get to the cemetery but 
there are currently Texas Longhorns in the lowland pond area to the north of 
here. They would get their long horns tangled in the brush if they try to get 
into the cemetery. I am told an out of town Doctor owns the property, so no 
longer in Arris Bass's name. Old home has been abolished too which was down on 
Shannon Creek Road northwest of the cemetery.<br/>
