<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS">FLOURNOY CEMETERY, Locust 
Hill, Beechwood Farm Rd., GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br/>
  <u>From The Flournoy Rivers Book, (widely quoted &amp; written 
in the 1890s)</u></font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">                Judge Harris' wife was Eliza 
			Flournoy, sister of my grandfather William C. Flournoy, 1 She was 
			born November 18, 1794 and died April 16 1829. They are buried at 
			"Locust Hill" where Amos Richardson's mother lives, on the Brick 
			Church Pike, about two miles north-east of Pulaski, in the Flournoy 
			burying ground there. Upon that plateau, Silas Flournoy, Mrs. 
			Harris' father, settled in the fall of 1816 or winter of 1816-17, 
			there he died May 18, 1822.  Of Judge Harris' three children who 
			reached maturity, Martha married Jerome Pillow and died childless.  
			Alfred married Martha Jones Squire Lew Jones' sister and died in 
			Shreveport, La., childless and Eliza went to Louisiana with her uncle 
			Dr. Alfred Flournoy, married a gentleman named Watson and has 
			descendants in Arkansas, Louisana and Texas.  A small upright 
			monument marks the two graves of Judge Harris and his wife in the 
			Flournoy burying-ground. In the Minute Book of 1828, Thursday, 
			February 21, 1828, the court heard of the death of Judge Harris, 
			which took place about 6 o'clock this morning at his residence in 
			the town of Pulaski.  The court adjourned out of respect to his 
			memory, resolved to attend the funeral "this afternoon", directed 
			that the members of the bar wear crepe on the left arm for thirty 
			days, page 105, 106. There is some connection in this direction that 
			gives Newt White his middle name "Harris", and to his brother Mr. 
			George White, his middle name "Simpson", but I don't know what it is 
			and they know less about it than I do. </font></b> </p>
