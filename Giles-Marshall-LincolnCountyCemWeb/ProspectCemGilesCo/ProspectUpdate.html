She was married in 1857 to Thomas Henry Griggs, Confederate soldier, Pvt Company 
H. Tenn. 6th Calvary Regiment, who according to Kathy Wood, was drug to death by 
a horse about 1879/80 and was buried in Lynnville, TN, in a lost cemetery in the 
woods across from Lynnwood Cemetery, Lynnville, TN. I went down there today and 
there's an old house in the center of that woods, that's literally falling down. 
It's totally overgrown and I walked around it on three sides and didn't see any 
grave markers, but that doesn't mean there aren't any there. I had a hard time 
getting in there and found an easier way out. There is also another lost 
cemetery in that place the Smith Cemetery which may be where Thomas Henry Griggs 
is buried. In 1888 the Railroad is where it was today so there is woods all 
around there over to the tracks. Eliza and Thomas also has another son John Bell 
Griggs who was born in Giles County and supposedly buried in Yeager, Oklahoma 
along with his wife Mary Alice Keaton, who are my mom's grandparents. Carol
