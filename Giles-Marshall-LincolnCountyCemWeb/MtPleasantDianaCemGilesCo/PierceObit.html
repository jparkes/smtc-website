	Funeral services for Arthur Pierce, 70, retired farmer of the Thirteenth

	burial in Diana Cemetery.<br/>

	<span style="font-family">The tombstone reads, �T.L.� and not Arthur? The 
	children's obituary cite his name as Arthur as does marriage license. Have 
	no idea what T. L. stood for. I don�t find a T. L. in the records. [RHW 26 
	Feb 2013]</span><br/>
	Its probably as anyone else with a formal name which gets changed along the 
	way to a nickname I will add to the listing to include his name as T.L. "Arthur" Pierce
