  From the above map we see the Dance Cemetery GPS location. I have visited this 
spot and if the GPS is right then this cemetery is unmarked. Was this cemetery 
moved?<br/>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Take Highway 55 northeast out of Lynchburg, 
Moore County and go about a mile and 1/4 and turn right (or east) on Bedford 
Hollow Road. Follow that until it loops back north and then back west (caution 
locked gate here) and go another 
100 yards and the cemetery is to your south (or right) in the woods about 100 yards into the 
woods. Tested 1 Dec 2011 and no cemetery was found under the red check. It 
appears to be an unmarked or moved cemetery.<br/>

  This Aerial Map shows the trees where the cemetery sits. Bedford Hollow Road 
it appears only has one home on it so that is where permission should be 
acquired before visiting this cemetery. Update 1 Dec 2011 - I went to this GPS 
location and there was no sign of a cemetery that I could see. One can see an 
old decaying antebellum house just to the right of the red check and there are 
barns SW behind that. The GPS may be wrong and this cemetery is 
behind that house in another of those thickets. This location is behind locked 
gates today, unlike in the past. <br/>
