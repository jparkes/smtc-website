Location from the 64 southern Bypass take Minor Hill Hwy (#11) south and go 
about 3 miles to the Scenic Drive Rd. and turn right. Go a few hundred yards 
on that road with a grass field on your right until you reach the first 
thicket or grove of trees spanning away northward from you. Walk (or drive if 
you want the risk) along that grove of trees on the east side about 2/3 the way to the 
north end 
and look left into the thicket for the large Walnut tree that marks this 
cemetery among many Hackberry trees. Under the Walnut Tree you will find 
the marked stones. This cemetery is not maintained but the 
vegetation is somewhat shaded out by trees.<br/>
