<b>On old Aymett 
place now owned by Dr. Joe Fite near Aymett Town. Take Highway 64 go past the 
(Leatherwood) road where you see the lumber mill. Joe Fite 
lives<br/>
in the large house upon the hill. Another set of 
instructions: Go East on Hwy 64 to Leatherwood Creek Rd and turn north and go 
to Cobb Lane and turn right.Â  Follow that as it snakes around and (with 
permission) turn right into the driveway of Dr Fite's home and park near the back 
side of his driveway and walk southeast toward the barn. You will find the 
cemetery behind &amp; northwest of the barn some 20 yards.<br/>
