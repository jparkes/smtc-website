<b><br>
Thomas H Maxey married Narcissa Yarbrough in 1852. They had Cornelia V Yarbrough 
Maxey, b. 9 Oct 1853. Narcissa died ca 1854, because Thomas H. was married again 
to Louisa E Clifton by the 1860 census. Thomas H. Maxey then goes off to the 
Civil War to fight for the Confederacy and dies 26 Mar 1862 at Mound City 
Illinois as a Prisoner of War in a hospital (diagnosis Erysipelas), then Louisa 
Emily Clifton Maxey marries again to John Chaffin. Cornelia V. Maxey, Thomas &amp; 
Narcissa's daughter, is then turned over to a guardianship. At 17 she marries J. 
S. Brewer and they have 6 children. Further the daughter Cornelia V. Yarbrough 
Brewer, dies in 1881 and is buried here in Yarbrough Cemetery under a formal 
tombstone. Her step-mother Louisa Emily Clifton Maxey Chaffin who married again 
to John Chaffin lived until 1917 and is interred in the Black Cemetery Northeast 
of Lawrenceburg Tn. Black Cemetery is on the same road, but nearly into 
Lawrenceburg Tn. <br>
<br>
There is no solid proof Narcissa's grave is located here, but the indicators are 
credible. [T.B.B./C.W.A., year 2010]<br>
<br>
Her husband Thomas H Maxey was 25 yrs old during the 1860 census putting his 
birth year as abt 1835 giving us the only clue as to her birth date.<br>
