<p align="center"><b>BROWN CEMETERY, (Good Billy,
Hwy 166, Al State Line), GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE</b><br/>
<br/>
<i><b>If anyone noticed the white splotchy
stuff on the stones from the photos you are very alert. That my friend is
vulture droppings. Yes vulture poop. A flock of them have taken to roosting here
at night. There is obviously nothing here for them to eat so they don't come
here during the day. I don't think the caretakers are aware of that because they
otherwise are doing such a great job of caring for this cemetery.Â <br/>
As I was about the business of photographing this cemetery I began to notice the
droppings, but was not sure what kind of bird made them, except it was clearly a
large one. Soon the answer practically fell out of the sky. I looked up and saw
a large flock the big black bare necked creatures swooping overhead circling
around as if I was vulture bait. More than likely they wanted their afternoon
nap, but when they got close enough and noticed me they moved on for they are
very shy birds. <br/>
When I got closer to their main roosting station on the tall monuments I began
to notice an awful odor filling my sensitive office worker nose. It bacame a
"close pin on nose affair" from that point on. Ha! <br/>
I had to be careful not to contaminate my hands for these and all birds can be
carriers of certain diseases like Hepatitis B. I was never more glad to have an
available supply of Windex and Listerine &amp; paper towels in my trunk to clean
my hands that day. <br/>
The vultures like to use the cemetery as a roosting place because it is next to
a creek. Also they can better navigate their large wings while taking off into
the open from the tops of the tombstones than from the ground where coyotes can
catch them. Taking to the air from inside leaf covered trees also presents a
difficulty for them. Maybe a big colorful scare crow would drive them to find
another place to roost. Who knows? Awe, the hazards of cemetery photography.</b><br/>
