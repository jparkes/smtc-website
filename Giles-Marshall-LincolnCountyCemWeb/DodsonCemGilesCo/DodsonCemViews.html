Ahead and to your left 200 yards is the thicket. Notice further on your left is
the Rail road tracks.<br/>

Looking northeast while standing on the Rails yields this photo of a cemetery
long abandoned &amp; impossible in this state to survey.<br/>

From inside the cemetery this train roared by, as I was trying to clear enough
brush to make photos.Â <br/>
The Engineer spotted me and acknowledged my presence with a wave of his hand. I
am sure he
wondered who that crazy guy was that was so deep into the thicket only with a machete
hacking away at the growth. Truth be known the soot from the train engine
fertilizes the growth and causes it to be denser than normal.<br/>
I did not show but few photos of this cemetery because it is impossible to see
anything beyond about 1 foot next to the ground.<br/>
