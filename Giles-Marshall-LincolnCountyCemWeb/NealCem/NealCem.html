Location: East on East Jefferson Street in Pulaski continuing on Beech Hill Road
if the road changes to that name. Look for the high rock wall on the right as
you travel out of town about a mile and one half.&nbsp;Cemetery is just before you get to Mark St. on the
right.<br>

Only one stone was found here in this very large and imposing rock wall
enclosure, but there could have been other memorials in past times. the rock
enclosure is big enough for 25&nbsp; to 50 graves. The weeds and brush were so
thick that I could not see well. However a nearby neighbor informed me that
there were no other memorial stones inside the rock wall enclosure.</font><b><font size="2" color="#000080"><i><br>
