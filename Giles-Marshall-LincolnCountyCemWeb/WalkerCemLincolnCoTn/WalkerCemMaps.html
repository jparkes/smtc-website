L</font>ocation: From Fayetteville go south on Hwy 231 to W. Lincoln Rd and turn 
west for a mile and then turn North (right) and go about 1/2 mile and the 
cemetery is just past a drive-way upon a bank and hard to spot because of 
hedgerows along the road. <font face="Comic Sans MS">Since there is no good 
place to park along this road parking in the residential drivewayÂ  shown in 
these maps is a given. This cemetery is located in a very dense privy hedge so 
you will likely have to cut your way into it with some kind of brush cutters.<br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the right after one passes the driveway 
going north on the right.<br/>
