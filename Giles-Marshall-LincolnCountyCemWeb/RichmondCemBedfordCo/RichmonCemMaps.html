Location: From 
Shelbyville go south on Hwy 231 and turn right on State Route 64. Follow that 
for about 3 miles and turn left (west) on Richmond Road (Hwy 130). Follow that for 
about 7 miles and turn left (south) on Hannah Gap Road. Go less than a mile and 
turn into the Richmond Cemetery Road and the cemetery will be on both sides of 
that road.</b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br/>

This is my rough attempt to draw out the boundaries of this cemetery, but do not 
take it as a legal document. I know there is an east side of the road and a west 
side of the road. Also I understand there is an African American Section, but 
since I did not cover the whole area I failed to identify that or to find any of 
the African American graves.<br/>
