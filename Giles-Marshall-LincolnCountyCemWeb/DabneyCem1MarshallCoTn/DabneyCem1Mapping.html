From Exit 22 of I-65 go southeast on Hwy 31 Alt to Buford Station Road and turn 
right. Go a 3 tenths of a mile and turn right (north) into Hart Leonard Road. 
Follow that up the slope until it goes into Marshall Co and becomes (or bear 
left) Cedar Knob Rd. Go about a 1/2 mile further and notice on the right a slope 
above the road and a field road leading to a visible locked gate. There is a 
locked gate and a walk-in gate. The walk-in gate is not locked. Go thru that and 
follow the field road or path northeast to the forest line 400 yards away and go 
nearly to the corner of the open field. Just back on your left is a crossing 
gate that will allow one to get into the next field without crossing over the 
wire fence. After that turn right and go straight toward the forest another 100 
yards and you will find the cemetery about 40 yards straight into the forest. 
Warning there is Deer &amp; Turkey hunters that keep company around this cemetery. 
Avoid their hunting seasons to remain safe from accident.<br/>
