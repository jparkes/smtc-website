Location: From 
Fayetteville go west on Hwy 64 past Boonshill and turn north or right on Parker 
Rd. Go all the way to the end of the road (abt 1/2 mile) and with permission 
turn left at the last house and drive by the house and out into the field road. 
Follow that and when the road comes out into an open field turn sharp right and 
follow the tree line on your right (south). Go about 200 yards to the cemetery 
which juts northward out into the field and has a noticeable rock wall and 
several cedar trees inside.</b><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"> 
There will be private property and private assets all around so leave that alone 
and don't touch. Camera are on this premises. Not sure they were active, but by 
all means do not touch them.<br/>
