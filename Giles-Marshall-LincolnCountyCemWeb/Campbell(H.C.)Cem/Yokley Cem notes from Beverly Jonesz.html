<div>Yokley cemetery - at Hwy 245 (Campbellsville Pike) and Smith Hollow 
Road. It's up on a hill and is visible from Hwy 245. It's in the middle of a 
farm property/cattle pasture, but is fenced around the cemetery. Lots of graves 
in it.<br/>I took pictures of as many as I could. Some were tipped over and too 
heavy to lift, and some were unmarked or marked with just a simple stone. It 
didn't have a sign or anything on the gate. There are some other families buried 
there as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The old cemetery book gives directions thusly: 
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yokley Cemetery location:  Hwy 64W, right 
through Campbellsville to Columbia Road. Cemetery on right on hill behind Angus 
house, in chain link fence.  </font></div><font face="Arial" size="2">

<div>Terina Boyd, who provided the photo of the stone 
for Emma Hayes, had this to say about Yokley Cemetery:</div>
<div>
<div class="CurrentMessage" style="WIDTH: 477px">
<div>I could not get every grave as some were tipped over and too heavy to lift 
and see who was on the stone. Cattle have been in the cemetery and have tipped 
over/damaged several stones and it is somewhat grown up with grass and weeds. 
Whoever owns the farm has also been dragging their dead cows into the cemetery 
to rot, lots of remains scattered around. There was a fairly "fresh" one in 
there when I went in, so I didn't stay in there as long as I would 
like.<br/>There were a few "box tombs" that were very worn or were damaged. Some 
I could read, and some not.<br/>There were some unmarked graves or graves with 
just a plain rock and no name.<br/>So I just took as many pictures as I could. 
<br/>Needless to say, there are definitely a few more graves that still need to 
be identified in that cemetery. May have to go back in there again.<br/></div>
<div>Beverly again.  Maybe you should see what Terina has already 
shot.  I'm glad to ask her, or just to ask what kind of dogs and people she 
encountered. (I only know about the cows.)  I've only seen one of her 
pictures from Yokley Cemetery:</div></div></div></font></div></div><span contenteditable="false"><span layoutemptytextwellfont="Tahoma" style="DISPLAY: block" xmlns:canvas="canvas-namespace-id"><span style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15px; HEIGHT: 19px; OVERFLOW: visible"></span><span style="DISPLAY: inline-block; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 25px; HEIGHT: 241px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: top; OVERFLOW: visible; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px">
