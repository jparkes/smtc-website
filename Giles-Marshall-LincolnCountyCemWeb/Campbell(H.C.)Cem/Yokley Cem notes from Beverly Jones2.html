<div>That's great!  Congratulations!</div>
<div>I wonder if Sarah Elizabeth Yokley (1858-1936) 
could be the stone "matching" the Sophronia Yokley stone.  Sophronia 
Yokley's dates were 1855-1931,</div>
<div>and the two sisters were unmarried (to the best 
of my knowledge) with close birth and death years.</div>
<div>I did not get to Yokley or Sam Yokley Cemeteries 
when I visited.  I did get to Morristown Cemetery where I photographed the 
gravemarker of Susannah Tacker Morris (1770-1840).</div>
<div>There are only five graves at Morristown, and my 
picture is not great.  I was totally lost when we arrived there, so don't 
ask <u>me</u> for directions!</div>
<div>I will share my photo, if you want to assess it 
for yourself.</div>
<div>Thanks again!</div>
<div>Beverly</div>

<div>Greetings Beverly</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Had a successful day yesterday visiting and photographing several 
cemeteries around Campbellsville. These are the ones.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Yokley Cemetery (100+ stones and not on any mapping to show it 
exist.)</div>
<div>Campbell-Rittenberry Cem (20+ stones, Campbellsville)</div>
<div>Campbellsville Cem - (about 400 stones, finished about 1/2 of it) Will 
return later for completion.)</div>
<div>Wilkerson Cem (10 stones)</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don't tell Terina I went there yet as I want her to send the photos 
she has and we can get the best of both photos. I did cover everything including 
the box tombs, but  there were two of the Yokley 
memorials tumbled on their face with the inscription down toward 
the ground and unmovable by me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Was this the case on your visit? Did you get the photos?</div>
<div>Also made a photo from the road of the Sam Yokley Cem but not a close up. I 
am counting on Terina's photos there. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dead cow is still there. Shooooey!. Got photos of this and might 
use it against the owner. One stone is within 10 yards of the carcass and that 
was the photo of the century as I see it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Saw the graves of my great aunt, hubby &amp; deceased children. The 
Vick's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of the stones I missed was Jacob Yokley. Hope there is a surviving 
inscription somewhere for that. Another was near Sophrinia Yokley and just like 
her stone so maybe her sister or spouse. </div>
<div> </div>

  <div>Mea culpa.  That's why it looks so neat and

  Cemetery.</div>
  <div>Terina DID also photograph the much larger and 
  cow-troubled Yokley Cemetery.</div>
  <div>I just sent you the wrong photograph, and figured I'd 
  better clarify before more confusion was created.</div>
