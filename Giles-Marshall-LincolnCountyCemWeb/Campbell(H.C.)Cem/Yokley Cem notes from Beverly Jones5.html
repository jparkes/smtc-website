<div>There are two other historic notes I failed to mention on the stones in 
Yokley Cemetery. There is a Franklin A., son of Andrew &amp; Delia Yokley who 
died in 1852 at the age of 21. He professed religion at the Popular Grove 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Well to me (and it has been my 
experience) this means this cemetery was probably founded by the Cumberland 
Presbyterians and that there as a church nearby with that name. Now try to find 
that bit of history in the cemetery book. I doubt if they even read it on the 
stone. Photo #1859. The church may have sat down where that house is 
now. Have any knowledge of that? Mary Bob will love translating that long 
poet inscription. Challenge now is to find some history on that old 
church.</div>

<div>Another note on a stone was in the cemetery book. A Civil War 
soldier David G. Alexander was wounded at the battle of Resaca, Ga. 15 May 1864 
and died 6 Jun 1864. Photo #1710.</div>

  <div>This was one of the names blocked by your fingers in

  <div>The two matching stones are for children of Jacob Yokley &amp; Almanza Ann Abernathy, so 
  the third stone is likely also to be their child.  It looks like seven of 
  their </div>
  <div>children are buried at Yokley Cemetery.  Terina 
  has photos of six of those stones----all but Andrew 
  "Geon" Yokley.  What do you think?</div>
