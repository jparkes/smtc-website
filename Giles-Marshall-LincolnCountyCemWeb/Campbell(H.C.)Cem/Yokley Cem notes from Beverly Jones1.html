<div>Morristown Cemetery</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     My vague memory doesn't 
include Morristown cemetery being on a hill.  I think we parked on the 
road immediately adjacent to the cemetery.</div>
<div>I will ask my cousin Porter Hannah where it is and how 
to get there.</div>
<div>     I THINK the 
Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery is on the land of Mark Dunavant, who is the person 
I have recently written to about the </div>
<div>Margaret Hannah mystery.  Mark and I are related 
through the Hannahs and the Campbells. He's a walking encyclopedia of local 
history, and very entertaining.</div>
<div>The name for Campbell-Rittenberry cemetery in the 
cemetery book is H.C. Campbell Cemetery, but I started using 
Campbell-Rittenberry because of the sign </div>
<div>on the gate.  You could be a 
trendsetter if you add West!  I read about the Rittenberrys 
recently.  They all lived in Alabama and seem like remarkable</div>
<div>people.  I ended up wondering why they were buried 
in Giles County, Tennessee.</div>
<div>     I sure wish I had had a bigger 
vision of what I was doing in 2002.  I could have photographed all five 
graves at Morristown.  I was a beginner.</div>
<div>I'm going to give another shot at figuring out who the 
mystery grave might be, but your process of elimination will be the key.  
Did you find a lot</div>
<div>of field stones in Yokley Cemetery like Terina 
did? </div>
<div>     Mark Dunavant may be the go-to 
person about the sorry condition of Yokley Cemetery.  I think I mentioned 
it in my letter.  Being a local landowner,</div>
<div>he may have standing to get something done about it 
(without having to sue----cheaper).</div>
<div>Later...</div>
