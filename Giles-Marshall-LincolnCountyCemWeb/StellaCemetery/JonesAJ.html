  <br/>
  </b>Obituary; The Pulaski Citizen 
	26 Dec 1912</p>

	A. J. "Uncle Jack" Jones, as he was 
	familiarly called by his friends, died suddenly at his home near Minor Hill, 
	Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock, his sudden death being a sincere shock to 
	his neighbors. He had not been feeling well for a day or two, but was up 
	going around the place, looking after some work. He ate dinner as usual on 
	Saturday and went to his bed and lay down. When some member of the family 
	went to arouse him they found that he was dead. Heart trouble is said to 
	have been the cause. Mr. Jones was over 83 years old, and had lived an 
	exemplary life, being kind and charitable to those who needed alms, and was 
	liked by all who knew him for his goodness of heart. Just two months since 
	his wife passed into the beyond and had expressed himself that he too soon 
	would follow. The funeral was conducted Monday by Rev. Mr. Hendrix of the 
	Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and the interment was beside his wife at 
	Pleasant Hill graveyard. Mr. Jones leaves five children, all grown and 
	married, two sisters, Mrs. M. Bassham and Miss Fannie Jones of this county 
	and one brother residing in Texas. In the death of "Uncle Jack" Jones, Giles 
	County loses one of its best citizens. Peace to his dust.<b><i><font color="#BB2206" size="2"><br/>
