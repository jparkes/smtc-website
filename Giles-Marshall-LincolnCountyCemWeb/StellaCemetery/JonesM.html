	morning of pneumonia and the infirmities of age, at her home near Stella, on 
	Tacket's Branch. Besides her husband, five children, all grown, survive her. 
	Mrs. Jones was a good woman and a good neighbor and her presence will be 
	greatly missed by a large concourse of friends. The funeral was conducted

	Church and the body was laid to rest in the adjoining church yard . Ref:
