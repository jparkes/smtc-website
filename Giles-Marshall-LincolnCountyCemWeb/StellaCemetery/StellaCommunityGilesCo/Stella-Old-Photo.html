This is an old photo that depicts the original village of
Stella. The structures are not so visible but shows us the original
layout of Stella.  We can see
the road is in about the same location as it once was.  I cannot for
certain say which store is on the extreme left, but will ask at homecoming Aug
1, 2004. Nearer the left middle are stables where students kept their horses
while at school according to my mother. The log looking building on the hill is
the original old Stella school before 1926 according to an article on Stella by Mary Lee
Harris published in the 178 page Homecoming '86 Giles County. On the right the white church is the Methodist Church which was moved from Mt. Carmel to Stella
in the late 1920's, disbanded and demolished in 1964. The Mt Carmel Cemetery
spring up around that church and is 2 miles north east of here on Tackett Branch
Road. Apparently one can see the
Stella Cumberland Presbyterian Church just above the Methodist Church but it is not clear from
this copy. Marilyn Hare 22 Jul 2004.</p>
