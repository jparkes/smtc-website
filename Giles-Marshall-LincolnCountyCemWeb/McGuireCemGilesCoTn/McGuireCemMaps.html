Exit 14 of I-65 which is the junction of Hwy 64 &amp; I-65 go east a few hundred 
yards and turn south (right) on&nbsp; Bradshaw Creek Road. Follow that south 
until it crosses into Lincoln County Tennessee and become Dee Solomon 
Road then back to Bee Springs road after crossing back into Giles County. Just 
past that turn 
right (west) into the long driveway of the old Story Farm. The cemetery is past several 
barns and sheds and requires accompaniment by one of the Story Brothers. </b></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

This aerial map shows the cemetery just north of a barn and west of a pond in a 
clump of trees. A fence line runs on the east side of the cemetery, but actually 
the whole cemetery is fenced.<br>
