David Abernathy, an American Revolutionary Soldier, 1759 - 1838. A tree is
growing up in the middle of his grave. The headstone is broken off and leaning
against the tree and the original footstone and new military marker is at the
foot of the grave.Â So restorers cut the tree down, and after making sure
the headstone is level enough to stand epoxy glue the top of the headstone back
onto its bottom part. Finally reset the military marker footstone higher above
the ground so it does not sink under the top soil and we are hopefully good for
another 100 years.<br/>

David Abernathy memorial. On a real rough surface stone the chalk to bring out
the inscription makes it worse. Compare Trina's photo to mine next below. <i>Photo

</i>"SACRED to the memory of David Abernathy was born the 22nd day
of July 1759 And died the 23 day of August 1838 aged 79 years and 1 Month."
The birth day is different from below 22 here and 29 on the military marker. The
death month is inscribed as April on the Military Marker. Since the age
calculation on this stone figures to August that is what I am using.<br/>

Military Marker for David Abernathy inscribed as: "DAVID ABERNATHY, NC
TROOPS, REVOLUTIONARY WAR, JUL 29 1759 - APR 14 1838." The day and month of
death is inscribed as 14 April on the Military Marker and 23 August on the
headstone. Since the age calculation on the headstone figures to August that is
what we will use. This military marker also has 29 Jul as the birth month and day and
we will present the original stone dating entirely.<br/>
