The Mrs Mary Echols Rainey monument as <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">photographed
by Terina Boyd 10 Oct 2009, before the stone was chalked in Dec 2009. <i><br/>
Notice the green and gray mosses and lichens that live on this stone. Their
presence there is good and bad. In a hail or ice storm they cushion the impact
of the ice striking this soft stone. However, in rain they hold water and
prevent the stone from drying causing expansion and contraction which ultimately
weakens the stone surfaces. Maybe the effects cancel out, but there is a lot
more rain than ice that falls.</i><i><br/>

This monument is on the ground. I don't recall turning this monument over to
determine if there was an inscription on the side next to the ground. Previous researchers do
list two inscriptions on this monument. Mary Claiborne Rainey &amp; Thomas
Rainey who was born 3 years after her. It is almost certain that the inscription
for Thomas Rainey is face down on the ground and I will show this information
reflecting that. <br/>
We
can see several field stones in this photo. They probably mark not only the
foot of Mr. Thomas Rainey &amp; Mrs. Rainey's graves but also the head or foot of graves of
other interments,
unknown to us. This is not a full view photo and I can still see four fieldstones
here two of which marks the foot of the Rainey graves. The others are unknown but chances
are they are related to the Raineys'. The maiden name of Mary Rainey is spelled Ech<u>a</u>ls
with an "a" on the gravestone. <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><i><br/>
