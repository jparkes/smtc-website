This is a fictional story of the death of a Johnnie in 1893 explaining an example
of fieldstones in Graveyards</u>:<br/>
<br/>
</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">"This year
(1893) we had a poor harvest because of the weather. Pa says our savings are
low. Last year 1892 Grandpa died and the cost of his headstone was high, but we
managed it somehow. He has one of those new pretty gray granite kind and it is supposed to last thousands of years. This year our 11 year old, fourth son, Johnnie died from the
croup. We marked his grave with simple stones until the tombstone salesman comes to
our neighborhood. Also we can save up for a pretty little memorial stone. After all everyone in the family knows
Johnnie is
buried two graves over the other side from Grandpa and his new stone." <br/>
The traveling memorial  stone salesman came to their area and left and as the
years counted by it became a little easier to ignore the two unmarked stones at the
head &amp; foot of Johnnie's grave. Other priorities continued to loom. They
kept on with their busy lives &amp; putting it off. Soon that generation matured
and passed and the next generation who had vaguely been made aware of the omission
at the graveyard concerning Uncle Johnnie's grave was into full season. However,
they too had other priorities. Soon they passed on too and the third generation
was not told about the fieldstone that marked then Great Uncle Johnnie's grave. This
was also complicated by the sudden death of members of the second &amp; third
generation who intended on telling each generation about the unmarked grave and
adding a headstone for Johnnie, but they died before that happened. <br/>
Well, now along came (us) the graveyard researchers asking this question: Whose
grave is this? We know it is a grave because we see the head of the grave is
marked with a stone, buried standing on its edge, facing east, and another
(foot) stone at the east end of the grave also buried standing on its edge,
facing east. There is enough space between the two  stones for an adult
grave. However, there is no name to be found and no answer is possible as to who
this mystery person that died long ago may be. Three generations have now passed
and we are into the fourth one &amp; no one in this generation can remember any
discussion of who is buried under this fieldstone. This was Great Grandma &amp;
Great Grand Paw's generation. Gr-Gr-Uncle Johnnie our subject under the
fieldstones was born in 1882 and died in 1893. There was no surviving census
from 1890 to tell us who all the children were in this family, so there is no record of
his birth or death exist in commonly found places. Death certificates were not yet invented either
at least in the
south.<br/>
We can find one consolation in all of this. Gods records are complete, but he is
not telling us earthly inhabitant. He does leave many clues for us to ponder and
occasionally figure out who may be buried under that common rock in the old
ancestral burial ground.<br/>

Fieldstone #5 above in its environment adjacent to the Wright Memorials. The
wright memorials have formal footstones so these and other fieldstones in that
area are for unknown graves. The white patch in the upper right area of the photo
is the Wright memorial. <i>Info and Photo by Wayne Austin 21 Dec 2009.<br/>

Fieldstone #7 &amp; #8 beside (this side of) the fallen tomb of Mrs. Mary C.
Echols Rainey. Her husband is believed to be buried here but his inscription may
be on the side of the memorial next to the ground. Fieldstone #8 can be seen in the
lower middle area of the photo sticking up among the weeds. <br/>
 Now I would be the
first to admit that these two fieldstones may mark the Rianey's graves and a
short number of years later someone set their memorial on the north end of their
graves and left the fieldstones to mark the head of their graves. Plausible,
but, I don't know the truth. I have seen many graveyard researcher make a simple
case of scenarios such as the above to keep it simple for the public. It is not simple and
anything is possible. They make statements such as 25 fieldstone marked graves
as if it were the perfect truth that there were twenty five more unknown graves. It is never
that simple, mainly because fieldstones become dislodged in time and become
scattered around the cemetery.<br/>
This photographer made a reasonable attempt to gather the fieldstones in the
photography session, but may have missed some. They are hard to see in the
weeds, being small
and next the ground.<i><br/>
