Cora Lee West, 17 Apr 1881 - 17 Aug 1881, daughter of J.C.
&amp; Delia West. This stone, though fallen, was set upon its base for the
photography. Notice the washed out look compared to the photo below. That is due
to the lighting poor conditions for this photo</b><i><b><br/>

Her parents are interred in the H.C. Campbell Cemetery aka Cambpell-Rittenberry
Cemetery in Campbellsville two miles south of here. Maybe the Wests' moved (or
at least started to using the other cemetery) to
Cambpellsville about the same time as the Poplar Grove Cumberland Presbyterian
Church was moved there? By 1903 J.C. &amp; Delia were burying small children in
that cemetery instead of here.</b><i><b><br/>
