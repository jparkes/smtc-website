<p align="center"><b>YOKLEY CEMETERY, (Hwy 245
&amp; Smith Hollow Rd) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<img border="0" height="250" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/YokleyCemGilesCo/DeadCows.JPG" width="399"/><br/>
Not the prettiest thing to look at. Please shield your children from this awful
photo of the carcass of a cow in this cemetery. The photo was made 10 Oct 2009
when the carcass was much fresher. The white splotches are vulture droppings. I
was told by a reliable source a (messed up) deer hunter killed this cow. Well he
bears the first responsibility for this, but the owner also should have buried
it or burned it.<br/>

</i></b><b>Q. X. Lane memorial.</b><b><br/>
This photo looking across the Lane grave lots also as you see finds the carcass
of a cow in your view. The deceased cow has been here for a long time and nature
has ravaged the remains. If this were fresh an individual could not get within
500 yards without gagging. I don't understand anyone tolerating this on their
farm. Farmers should not be disposing of cattle remains in graveyards, not
according to health standards nor especially improperly such as this. </b><b>There
was also evidence that cattle remains had been burned in this graveyard in the
past such as spent fires and scattered cattle bones. <u>Lawmakers</u> now you
see why we genealogist clamor loudly for more control over our ancestral
cemeteries in the Tennessee Laws.<br/>
