Someone has left the carcass of a deceased Cow in this cemetery. The vultures
paid their visit and were roosting on the stones as they fed on the carcass
leaving these stones in a mess and potentially medically harmful to humans. By
the time I visited there in December to help Terina with the photography the
vultures had left and this stone was somewhat washed (except for the white
residue) clean by rainwater, but much of the carcass was still nearby. Photo by
Terina Boyd 10 Oct 2009.<br/>
