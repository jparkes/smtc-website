&amp; Smith Hollow Rd) GILES COUNTY TENNESSEE.<br/>

This fieldstone marked grave with a head and footstone is likely for an infant
child. It is located in the Vick area of the graveyard, about 15 feet northeast
of the head stone of John H &amp; Annie Jane Vick.<br/>

Vick family memorials under the tall shrub bushes out next to the fence. Here we
also see the fieldstones that line the same row adjacent to the Vick memorials
as we are looking south from over next to the gate. We will track them
individually down the row going south down the north/south row.<br/>

This is a close up view of the same photo at the  top of this page where we
are looking down the row of what I believe to be the Vick family graves many of
them unknown interments and the last 5 of them with marked stones. Due to the
high weeds and summer brushes coverage many of he photos that Trina took were
not as visible as the ones taken in December by this photographer, but these are
surperb photos. <i>Photo by Trina Boyd 10 Oct<br/>

</b> <b>VICK, W.A. or W.J., (</b>no dates, fieldstone hand inscribed with initials W.A. and surname
Vick in the row with the Vick family graves. This is thought to be Wesley J. 
Vick born 1821 and died unknown. Might be the father of John H. Vick.)<br/>
<b>This rough cut (2nd in our row) fieldstone is hand
inscribed with the lettering W. A. (or J) Vick . Findagrave.com says it is
