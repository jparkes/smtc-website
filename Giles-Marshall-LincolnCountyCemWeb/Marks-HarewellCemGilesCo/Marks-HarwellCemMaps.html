Go East on E. Jefferson St which becomes Beech Hill Road aka old hwy 15. Veer left 
or north and continue on Beech Hill Road and turn right on Old Smith Hollow Road 
after about 7.5 miles. Go about a 1/4 mile after crossing the creek and with 
permission veer right into a driveway and the gate is on the right to go up to 
the cemetery above you on a small hill top. You may not be able to climb the 
steep hill so walk if necessary. Permission should be acquired before crossing 
into the gate.<br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery fenced in an odd shape. It was not well 
maintained when I was there. Brush and weeds were head high. The owner 
apologized for that but it is not his responsibility to keep this cemetery up. 
The descendents have that failed obligation. The road to the cemetery 
also doubles as the road to the residence and also to the farm operation so be 
sure you go here with deliberate upscale intentions and secure permission.<br/>
