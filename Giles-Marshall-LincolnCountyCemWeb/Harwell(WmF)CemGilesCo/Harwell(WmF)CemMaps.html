Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski on Mill St./Hwy 166. Continue south passing the 
Airfield then the <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: #000080">Rock 
Crusher on the right. Just after the rock Crusher turn right on Donahue Rd and take the first 
left 
(south) on what is mapped as Story Lane or Fry Lane or it seems to continue as 
Donahue Road. This road immediately bends back westward. After about 2/3 a mile 
the road forks to Garner Hollow Road (left) on the south fork, but turn right on 
the right fork to continue on Donahue Road as shown on the above map. After about 
6 tenths of a mile take the road left which two serves two homes. When 
confronted with a fork take the right driveway and go to the A-Frame home. With 
permission cross the field to the northwest of the home to the cemetery which 
sits just back inside the tree line under a chain link fence. This  is only 
about 300 yards across the field from 
the home as shown in the next map. The home and (I think) the land also is today 
owned by the Hopper family.<br/>

This map shows the location of the cemetery across the field from the home. 
Please do not disturb anything private while here. This cemetery is threatened 
by Privet Hedge and will be impassable in a few years if this (invasive, rain 
loving) stuff is allowed to grow unchecked.<br/>
