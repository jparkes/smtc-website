<p align="center"><b>EZELL/ABELL/MENAFEE
CEMETERY, near Ardmore,GILES COUNTY,  TENNESSEE.<br/>

Here we see in this view looking northeast the fallen and plundered memorials of
the Ezell Cemetery. This cemetery would restore beautifully if it was first
fenced to keep out the livestock. Then the memorials could be stood back up. A
few of them would have to be Epoxy glued to stand. How can one tell if the
stones were knocked over by livestock. The bases are still level and there is
livestock and cow poop in the area. Now I can't say whose cattle knocked over
these tombstones. It could have happened years ago.</b><b><br/>

</i>Here is the memorial of James Thomas Rather shown in the foreground of
cemetery. That is a Fire Ant Hill surrounding the stone. It will not likely go
deep enough to harm the stone.<br/>

Here we see the home-site the only remaining evidence of the old Ezell Homeplace.<br/>
It lies about 100 yards to the north of this cemetery. As you can see only the
partial standing rock chimney remains of the home now. Electrical equipment nearby indicates this
place was still being used as a home after the 1930s when electricity was
installed around the south.<br/>
