					This E-mail relates to the sone William

					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
					For sometime Sue Davis and I have exchanged ideas as to 
					where Carr Bailey White and his second wife Mary Elizabeth 
					Watson were buried. I have suggeted that they may have been 
					buried near the White home on White Ridge. However, she has 
					pointed out that people who have spent much time on that 
					ridge say that they have not seen any sign of graves there.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 1.25pt; margin-left: -1.25pt; background: white">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
					My view is based mainly on a story that Paul R White related 
					about two years ago that Collie White (now deceased) of 
					Athens Alabama told him. Collie, a descendant of C B White, 
					remembered that when a boy he attended the burial of "an old 
					lady White", believed to be the widow of Carr Bailey White. 
					It was up on White Ridge, in late December, ice and snow 
					covered the road, the horses were unable to pull the hearse 
					up the hill, men carried the casket up to the burial place. 
					Those are the kind of details that would stick with a boy 
					for life.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
					Sue recently corresponded with Randall and Dean Noles, only 
					living children of Deward Noles who was the son of Matt 
					Noles and wife "Mattie", daughter of Willis Warren White, 
					son of C B White. I am attaching their response (below) 
					which may be of help to you. (It may not mean much if you 
					have not been to that area.)</span></p>

					 I asked Randal Noles, youngest son of Deward Noles about a 
					graveyard on White Ridge. <br/>He asked his brother for me 
					and this is their reply.<br/>Please forward this to other 
					descendants for me.<br/>We really need someone to check deeds 
					that understands them then maybe we could figure out where 
					CB White owned if this could be him.<br/>There are missing 
					Forsythe people that lived on the ridge.<br/>So the graves 
					might not be of the White family.<br/><br/>The road beside 
					Sugar Creek Bridge goes to Avery Word's farm.<br/>One way 
					goes to Puncheon, so be sure you go the correct way.<br/><br/>
					Talked to Dean and he said to say "Hello" to you. He said 
					that at one time there were a couple of very old markers . 
					If you go up on the Henry Goar road just below our old place 
					and just before the Goar place. At the top of the hill, 
					there were two huge Oak trees on the Goar Property to the 
					right. Follow that ridge line out until it starts to go down 
					to the old Avery Word Farm. The markers were at the top of 
					the ridge overlooking the bluff going down. He thought it 
					may have been 60 or more years ago when he saw them. He also 
					reminded me of the old grave yard on the side of the hill 
					just below our old house on the Wade Farm side of the 
					Highway. It was almost straight across from where our barn 
					was. There were several graves there but we always knew it 
					as The Old Slave Grave Yard. Other White People could have 
					been buried there also. Don't know if this helps or not but 
					it all we have. </span></b></p>

		<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: black">Paul, Did you see the E Mail I 
shared yesterday regarding the Thomas Jefferson White buried in Iowa. His 
parents are listed on FindAGrave. This Thomas and his parents are from Ohio and 
Indiana. He is not our Thomas Jefferson White. I recall an article but can't 
recall if on Lincoln Co TN Fayetteville Observer newspaper articles but it 
probably was. It stated that James Franklin White�s daughter, Diannah Frances 
would be responsible for her brother Thomas Jefferson. I thought that her 
brother was retarded but obviously my first thought was he was still a minor. 
Why is everyone sure he is not buried where his father, mother and siblings were 
buried? I missed something here it seems. James Franklin had a couple of 
children who died in same period he did of Flux. Need to look up their names. 
Seems like James Carroll was one son. One was just an infant. Why are we looking 
all over for his children Ginny</span></p>

		<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;color:#1F497D">My information 
indicates that Thomas Jefferson White, son of James Franklin White also has a 
tombstone in Rose Hill Cemetery, Fayetteville, TN which, in addition to his 
dates of birth and death, also indicates that he was the father of Willie 
Holland Green. Who was he? This is perhaps the reason for Mike Scott�s 
information in his telephone call to Jim. This was a fairly common name. The 
original Thomas White seems to disappear from Lincoln Co., and has no grave 
listed in the various published cemetery listings for Lincoln Co., which, by the 
way, I re-checked at the State Library here last weekend. Maybe he did die in 
Iowa, but Ginny�s Find-A-Grave information does not completely fall in sync with 
what we think we know from previous research. I would caution once more that 
internet genealogical research is all suspect unless and until documentary proof 
� often lacking in the online information and family lineages located there As Jim so aptly 
says, �Keep Looking.� Very truly yours, Paul R. white. </span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Cousins and 
friends,</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">I just concluded a 
long conversation with another caller in response to the newspaper letter. This 
was Mike Scott who lives in Fayetteville. I will relate his story as he told it 
to me. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Mr. Scott was born 
in 1925 on or just off Stephens Creek and grew up there. The community was then 
called Ego and had a school where he attended. He was in the Navy 21 years 
during WW II and the Korean War. He knows the Stephens Creek area well.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">His grandmother was 
a Copeland and a cousin to Bob and Jim Tucker who lived just around the corner 
on Tucker Hill (now Loyd Chapel Rd). At that time a Tucker owned and lived in 
the house on the land where White Cemetery is located. Mike was there nearly 
every day playing with their daughter. The house was still standing during WW 
II. It was probably torn down in the 50's. (Are these Tuckers descendants of 
William White, through his daughter Edith Chapman by his first Unknown wife, who 
married James Tucker and had sons Bob and Jim?)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Mike said that Mr. 
White (Thomas Jefferson) ran a store where the barn now is. On Saturday nights 
they would have music and dancing in the store. The store closed before he was 
born and was converted to a share-croppers house. Later it was made into a barn. 
Someone, (I think that it was a Tucker woman) told how the body of Mr. White (T 
J) was dug up and moved to another place, but he is not sure where. (Paul take 
notice). </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">{I think that 
fairly well covers the high points of our talk. I have his address and phone 
number and will get back to him. If he is able perhaps he could ride out to the 
White place with me sometime.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">He certainly opens 
up debate on some issues for us to consider. It appears that the land where the 
house and cemetery are remained in the William White family for many years. The 
deed to a Martin by James F and Carr B White may have not have been completed. 
After A J White it belonged to the Tuckers who were possibly descendants of 
William White. The house that stood on the ground with the chimney may not have 
been the original home of William White. However he may have had one that 
preceded this.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Dr. Akin, who now 
owns the land, told me that he was told that the barn was used as over night 
stables for travelers. A store, public stables, all indicate more use of that 
area than it now shows.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Here is more work 
for all of you to jump in and see what you can find out. I would suggest that 
any replies be sent to all on the list and not just to me. That would make it 
necessary for me to pass your information on to the others. Remember, we are all 
in this same family ship. Let us all row, row, row.</span></p>
