 200 yards. The stones here are five in number. From left to right: Emma Frances

descendents. They are L to R, Wayne Austin, Administrator of this site, of
Alabama &amp; Linda Stevens Munroe of Bartow Florida. I believe the logging
company installed the caution tape to prevent damage to the cemetery. <i>Photo

This view looks west at the memorials. Here we can clearly see the
small footstones in front of the main headstones all facing east. This cemetery
has been burned over. There are bits of burned wood all around. It is not good
to burn a cemetery as it softens the stone and may set them it up for future
crumbling.&nbsp;
