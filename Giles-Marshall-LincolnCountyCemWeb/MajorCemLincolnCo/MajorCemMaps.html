  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go east on Hwy 
		64 a couple of miles or and turn left on Hwy 273 - Old Elkton Pike. 
		Follow that for more than 17 miles and turn left or south on Hill Road. 
		Follow Hill Road for a couple of miles and junction off on Mullins Road. 
		Mullins at first is only a residential road to one house and the Major 
		Cemetery. When it junctions to go to the house go right and that takes 
		you to the cemetery. Now this road becomes abandoned after a few hundred 
		yards so expect fallen logs etc to stop you and cause you to walk the 
		rest of the way. Also in the wet season water flows down the old road. 
		It is cut deep into the ground being an old unimproved horse drawn wagon 
		Road from the pioneer days. The Cemetery is upon the bank of this road a 
		few hundred yards after you branch off the residential part. Though the 
		Major Cemetery is probably on private land you may not need permission 
		assuming Mullins Road is not private and the right of way into the 
		cemetery is not private.<br/>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly located on the left side of 
		the abandoned Mullins Road which at the cemetery is almost a gully. You 
		might want to notify the owner of the 
		property of your 
		visit to the cemetery to avoid alarming them and you will have to do so 
		if the gate is locked.</font></b><br/>
