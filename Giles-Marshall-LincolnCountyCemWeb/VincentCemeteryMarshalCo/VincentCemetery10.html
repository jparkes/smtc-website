<font size="2"><b>VINCENT, J. A., 17 Oct 1840 - 31 Jul 1933. (3rd Tenn Reg.,
C.S.A.)<br/>
VINCENT, Martha C., 14 Mar 1846 - 7 Jun 1882.<br/>
<br/>
This is the largest monument in this cemetery. It is about a one ton modern gray
granite memorial. It was toppled on its face probably by the tree trunk you see
above pushing against the base rendering it out of level. Couple that with
cattle rubbing against it to appease their itching and it fell off its base onto
its face. One can tell the cattle rubbed against it because the corners are
rounded off very smooth with the polish gone. The stone cannot be raised without
equipment. <br/>
I was therefore unable to confirm the inscription for J. A. &amp; Martha
Vincent. Unless Marshall County translators did so, Mr. Fred Hawkins was the
last person during 1987 to read &amp; publish the inscription so we are relying
on him or even prior predecessors.<br/>
