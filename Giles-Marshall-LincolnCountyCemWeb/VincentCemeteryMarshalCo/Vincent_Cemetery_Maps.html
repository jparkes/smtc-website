</b><b>From I-65 take Exit 32 toward
Mooresville 2 tenths of a mile and turn right (North) onto Gupton Road. Go about
1 1/4 mile north on Gupton Road and look left and there will be a Fence Row
(shown above as a green line) going away from the Road (west) leading first down
into a hollow and continuing up a sharp hill to a ridge running parallel with
the road. The cemetery is to the right (north) of that fence row upon the top of
that ridge among a stand of Trees (mostly Cedar). The cemetery is at a distance
of about 250 yards west of Gupton Road. <br/>
