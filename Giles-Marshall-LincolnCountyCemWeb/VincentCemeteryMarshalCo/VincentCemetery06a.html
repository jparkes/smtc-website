Footstones are mostly all that remains here. Folks this is the works of a
vandal, better known as the "Scum of the Earth." A tree falling on a
stone will not cause widespread random scattering and missing pieces that I
found here. The works of a Vandal generally manifest itself this way. First they
take stones and smash them together and break as many of them as they can. Next
they engage in a throwing party, scattering the fragments around causing
actually more damage than breaking them.<br/>
