The Bettie Orr memorial showing the headstone (upper part of the photo) smashed
and parts scattered around the cemetery by vandals. We can see the footstone
with the top just barely above the ground near the bottom of the photo. <br/>

The Footstone for Bettie Orr. As you can see the inscribed initials had to be
uncovered from the earth.<br/>

Footstone is mostly all that remains. Folks this is the work of a vandal. A
tree falling on a stone will not cause random scattering and missing pieces that
I found here. I can only make out "Bettie" "Born N _ _  10,
1_ _ _, DIED _ _ _ 1, 188_." There is a fragment with the Mason symbol that
is probably part of another missing &amp; broken memorial. I left this
collection near the Vincent
memorials. There were stone fragments found all over this cemetery, but
many of them were eroded and unreadable. <br/>
