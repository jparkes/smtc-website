This view standing in the center of the old historic section looks at the
Crockett, Montgomery, Shields and others. Notice the old clumps of Bear Grass.
This stuff can grow for hundreds of years and was planted there because it would
last.<br/>

This view focuses on the Crockett &amp; Ausban areas. That is Jane Carr memorial
closest to us with her footstone closer than that. The memorial just in front of
the bear grass clump on our right belongs to infant Robert Monroe Kerr. Not sure
what his or Jane's relationship to Crocketts' was but close for sure. Robert
Crockett's wife Rachel was a Kerr it is believed. Her stone is the tall pointed
top one just under the rear tire of the white truck in the distance. In some
circles the Kerr and Carr surnames were one in the same.</p>
