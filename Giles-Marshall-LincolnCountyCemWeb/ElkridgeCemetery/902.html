<p align="center"><tt>Colonel John Washington Shields Alexander was the son of  
General Milton King Alexander and Mary Shields. Colonel John Washington Shields 
Alexander was born<br/>
1822 in Giles County,TN and died 1863 at the Battle of Chickamauga.  Milton King 
Alexander was born in Elbert County,GA in 1796 to John Brown Alexander and<br/>
Barbara King who married in Charlotte,Mecklenburg County,North Carolina in 1786. 
Barbara King was a sister to Hugh King.  Hugh King applied for a revolutionary 
war pension in Maury County,TN in the 1830's. James 
Shields of Maury County,TN, gave a sworn statement that he knew Hugh King in 
Mecklenburg County,NC who was his neighbor. This James Shields was born in 1762 
and died in 1840. He<br/>
married Jane Montgomery. They are buried in the Elk Ridge Cemetery in Giles 
County,TN. <br/>
I was hoping this Mary Shields might have have been the daughter of George 
Shields who is listed in the 1820 census, but seeing the name "King" Mary<br/>
must have been the daughter of James Shields and Jane Montgomery.
The wife of Hugh King, Mary Montgomery, is buried in the 
Elk Ridge Cemetery in Giles County,TN.<br/>
Hugh King,Milton King Alexander and wife Mary Shields,John Brown Alexander and 
his wife moved on to Vermilion County,Illinois.The 1850 census of Vermilion 
County, Illinois lists Milton K. Alexander, age 49,b, Elbert County,GA and  Mary 
Shields, age 49, b. Elbert County, GA. Here is a picture of Colonel John Washington 
Shields
Alexander &amp; burial record: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=28085339.  <br/>
I am interested in George Shields and his son Alexander Shields who appear on 
the 1820 census of Giles.<br/>
Correction: Milton King Alexander and Mary Shields Alexander are on the 1850 
census of Edgar County, IL, not the Vermilion County census of 1850. Vermilion<br/>
County, IL borders Edgar to the north. The name of Hugh King is written in stone 
at the Vermilion County, IL courthouse.</tt></p></blockquote>
