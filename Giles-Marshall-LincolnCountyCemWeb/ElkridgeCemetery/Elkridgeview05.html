We are standing in the eastern part of the old
section of the cemetery and looking almost due north across Highway
129. There are many children's memorials in this area. The Elkridge Presbyterian Church I am told was across the road and a bit further
east of the open field shown above. Also notice the black section is up the bank
across the road to your upper left.<br/>

This view standing on the northwest side of the cemetery looks southwest  out over part of the cemetery.
Families <br/>
tended to cluster together leaving wide open spaces in these old cemeteries.
Sometimes the wide open space <br/>
contains the remains of unmarked graves and sometimes not. Also sometimes the
spaces contained the remains <br/>
of slaves most times in unmarked graves. I do not believe there are slaves
buried here though because the <br/>
families I have studied here in this cemetery had very few if any slaves. They
did their own back breaking <br/>
work and were proud to tell you that.</p>
