  </b>MONTGOMERY, Samuel, 1732 - 1808,
  Revolutionary War Soldier, Pennsylvania Capt. 3 Regt. We are blessed that
  those who went before us preserved the knowledge of such as that shown here.
  Without their works we would not even know this important grave existed. This
  is a modern military marker of a very old American Revolutionary War Soldier.
  As evidenced above there are at least two graves here denoted by the lined cut
  limestone rock that line the two graves noticeable in the next photo from the
  bottom. Also we have provided a 180 degree view with the photos above. <br/>
  According to history the Montgomery's and Shields and Crockett's all came here
  in the Elkridge community and founded the Elkridge Presbyterian Church about
  1807. I am told the building was located across the highway north of here but
  may have been built later. This place is blessed with fertile valleys of rich
  farming soil on the banks of the Roberson Fork Branch of the Richland Creek
  which empties into the Tennessee River about 50 miles south of this
  place.  <br/>
