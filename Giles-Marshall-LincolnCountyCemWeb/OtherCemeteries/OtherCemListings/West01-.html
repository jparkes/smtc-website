Nancy B. "Nannie" Anderson West<br/>
Birth: unknown<br/>
Death: unknown<br/>
<br/>
Wife of John Walter West (1834-1924)<br/>
Birth &amp; death dates unknown - no cemetery listing has been reported yet - This 
could be an unmarked grave.<br/>
Born about 1840 died prior to 1824 when her husband reportedly died as a 
widower.<br/>
<br/>
Censuses show Nancy B. (?) West as deceased wife's name. Further investigation 
by Linda Munroe find a death certificate with her name as Nancy B. (Anderson) 
West<br/>
So far no gravestone has been reported in Maplewood Cemetery for either John 
Walter West or his wife. Either he is in an unmarked grave or it was missed by 
transcribers thus far.</p>
