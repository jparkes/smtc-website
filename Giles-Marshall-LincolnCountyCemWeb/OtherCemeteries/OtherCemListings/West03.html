Draft registration filled out in 12 Sep 1918: Christopher Carson West was born 
10 Nov 1878 (note gravestone says 1884. Because of the birth dates of his 
siblings I am staying with 1878), was white, tall, slender, had black <br>
hair &amp; brown eyes, and his occupation was an Auto Repairman. His nearest 
relative was (father) John Walter West who lived in Pulaski, Giles County 
Tennessee. The document was signed by Christopher Carson West and <br>
certified by Henry McMillian of the board of registration, 12 Sep 1918. This was 
a WWI draft registration. He also gave his name as Carson C. West. [C. Wayne
