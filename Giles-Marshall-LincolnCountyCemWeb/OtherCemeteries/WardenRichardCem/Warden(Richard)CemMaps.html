</font><font size="2" color="#0000FF">This map shows the various historical sites of the Warden family along Big Dry 
Creek &amp; Road. We are a few miles south of Campbellsville Giles County</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
Perhaps a spot that could be used here would be GPS Latitude: 35.29613, 
Longitude: -87.14241, not the exact spot on the above map. I chose the spot 
under the nearest tree line. I must say this is an archeological perspective and 
not a legal one. Lets not hold the land owner accountable for this spot. This 
information stands on theory only.<br>

is today Big Dry Creek Road on the west side of the road.</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>

as being somewhere in this photo above on that hillock. At Richard Warden's time 
of death (1881) all that land upon the hilltop was woods</font><font size="2" color="#BB2206">*</font><font size="2" color="#0000FF"> 
and his grave was probably destroyed when the area was bulldozed sometime in the 
mid to late 1900s. I do not know if he had an inscribed gravestone. No doubt 
they at least marked his grave with a common boulder. <br>
</font><font size="2" color="#BB2206">*</font><font size="2" color="#0000FF">It 
was woods because in those days they had no reason to clear off the hill tops. 
Crops could not be grown up there. The soil was not good enough - without 
fertilizers. Folks wanted to be interred on the hill tops because that was 
better for preservation and closer to heaven.<br>

conclusions drawn from the Newspaper Obituary, Family information and overlaying 
the 1876 DG Beers map of Giles County onto today's topographical maps showing 
where the Richard Warden farm house was located.<br>
Please keep in mind this is an archeological (theoretical) perspective. I have 
no absolute proof of the grave site, so don't go visiting here for the 
gravestone &amp; pestering the current land owner looking for the grave of Richard 
Warden. C. Wayne Austin ggg-Nephew.<i><br>
