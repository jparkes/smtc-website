This map shows where I have placed a red check along Tatum Road as the Long Cemetery. This cemetery is about 35.2887 degrees North X 87.13 degrees West.<br/>
From Highway 166 take Big Dry Creek Road south from Campbellsville three miles 
to Tatum Road and turn east or left. Go 1/2 mile and look left at the cemetery 
between the two houses, one is a modular home.<br/>

This Aerial view shows the Long Cemetery road misplaced 800 feet too
far (Red X'es) to the east spanning from Tatum Road northeast. In the bottom left of the view there 
is really the Long Cemetery road but it also serves as a road to the two Long 
families living in the two houses here. A long yellow pointer points out the 
cemetery marked with a red check between and in front of the two houses.<br/>
