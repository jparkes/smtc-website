This is a family cemetery started in 1989 by the Longs. They moved up here in 
the 1960s and have been a farm family since.  This 
cemetery is as a place of quiet solitude to reflect on the memories of the 
Long family.  Added here 1 Nov 2010 from photos dated 16 Oct 2010 and 
interviews with James &amp; Minnie Long. [C. Wayne Austin]</font></p>
