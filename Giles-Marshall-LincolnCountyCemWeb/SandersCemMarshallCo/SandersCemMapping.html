  From the above map we are given the Sanders Cemetery GPS location as Lat. 
	N. 35.34961, Long. W. -86.67603.<br/>

	Location: Go north from Petersburg about 1/4 
	mile on Hwy 130 aka Richmond Road to Bert Watts Rd and turn (east) left. After the 
	road bends back NW go to the 1st house on the right and the cemetery is 
	on the hill on the right side of the home behind a locked gate. This elderly 
	lady was clearly sick but she answered the door and allowed me to get 
	past the gate (up the slope) and into the cemetery. Bless her soul. <br/>
	Do not go to this place if your intentions are not
  honorable. Respect must be shown at all times for those gone before us by
  not disturbing (harming) their monuments &amp; graves.<br/>
