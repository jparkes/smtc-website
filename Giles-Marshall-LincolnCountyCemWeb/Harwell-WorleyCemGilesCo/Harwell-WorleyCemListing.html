<br/>
</font><font color="#000080" face="Georgia">I paid a visit to what I think is this cemetery and there is evidence of graves here but no 
inscriptions remain that can be found. One grave is lined with rough cut stone and has a 
eroded sandstone for a headstone. Nothing remains that appears to me to be a formal 
tombstone. The gentleman who owns this property showed me this cemetery. His 
family has been in possession of this land many years 
and he said there was at one time a granite tombstone with the name McLin on it, but 
neither he nor I could locate any tombstones. <br/>
I offer this listing from Jean Cosby which has the original entry in the book 
and some research to add more genealogy. Originally this or a similar 
listing was presented on Page 527 of the book Giles County 
Tennessee Cemeteries but it cannot be verified using the tombstone 
records even though the locations match. </font></b></p>

<b><font color="#000080" face="Georgia">Oddly this unedited listing  
appears in the cemetery book on page 170. It has some of the same names, dates and a 
different location as being across I-65 &amp; Hwy 64 and southeast of here in 
Cucumber Hollow. I could not identify Cucumber Hollow on any map I had. As of 
yet I do not know the location of this cemetery nor the cause of he confusion in 
names.<br/>
<br/>
Harwell is a very old surname in Giles County. Studying the censuses shows that. I was not able to quickly identify any of the above Harwells' in the census. 
This shows up as the Dist 20 in the 1876 Mapping.</font></b></p>
