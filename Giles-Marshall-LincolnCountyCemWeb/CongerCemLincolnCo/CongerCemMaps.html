This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Conger Cemetery. I have verified these 
coordinates and they appear correct.<br/>

Location: Go north on from Fayetteville on Mimosa Road to Hamestring Road. Turn 
right or east there and go about 1/2 miles and with permission turn into the 
farm road and go south about 500 yards. The cemetery is on your left in a field 
next to a fence row.Â  <br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery in the edge of the tree line. You will have 
to follow the farm road southward that is wavy. The old road, shown as a straight 
line on this map, is not passable any more. I was shown this cemetery by the owner 
who descends from the folks buried in this cemetery. His house adjacent to here 
was built in 1808 and is known as the historic Conger Log Cabin or the oldest 
home in Lincoln County Tennessee. The home is visible from this map to the east 
of the cemetery.<br/>
