Obituary: The Pulaski Citizen 18 Mar 1942<br/>
Mrs. Lucy R. Grigsby Baugh, aged 92 years, one of the county�s oldest citizens, 
died early Saturday morning at her home in the Aspen Hill section, following an 
illness of a few months. Funeral services were conducted at the residence of 
2:30 o�clock Sunday afternoon, with the Rev. J. W. Bryson, pastor of the Pulaski 
Presbyterian Church officiating. Interment took place in the family cemetery 
nearby. Mrs. Baugh, the widow of John L. Baugh who died many years ago, has been 
a leading business woman, operating her farm &amp; other interests with the ability 
rarely found in a woman of her generation. A daughter of the late Col. E. W. 
Grigsby &amp; Mrs. Permelia Adams Grigsby, she was born in Limestone County, 
Alabama. Col. Grigsby moved his family to Elkton, Tenn., soon after the close of 
the Civil War, where her marriage to John L. Baugh took place in 1871. In later 
years the Baugh family settled in the Aspen Hill community where they were 
identified with the interests of that section. Mrs. Baugh is survived by one 
son, J. F. Berry Baugh; three grandchildren, Berry Baugh, Jr., Birmingham, Mrs. 
Paul Reinking, &amp; Glenn Baugh, of Dallas, Tex., &amp; a great-granddaughter, Lucy Fay 
Reinking; one sister, Mrs. Ida Beasley of Birmingham; one brother, E. N. Grigsby 
of Elkton, &amp; several nieces &amp; nephews.<br/>
