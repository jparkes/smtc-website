From Lewisburg go west on Hwy 373 to just before I-65 turn south (left) on Globe Road 
and go a just over a mile and the cemetery is east (left)on a hill 
about 1/4 mile with a well maintained road to visit. Turn into the road that doubles as a residential road and follow that due east until the 
road goes up a hill and the cemetery is just ahead of you on the right. The road to the 
cemetery is open but you may need permission. You will pass very 
close to a house on what appears to be a private road.<br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery under the small clump of trees out in a big

This image shows the cemetery and the road into there. The road is lime gravel. 
The cemetery was well cared for. <br/>
