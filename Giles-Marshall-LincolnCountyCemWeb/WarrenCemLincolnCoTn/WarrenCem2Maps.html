  <font color="#000080"><b>Location: Take Highway 64 east out of Fayetteville 
and turn north on Hwy 50 toward Lynchburg and go 1/4 mile and turn back right on 
Providence Rd. Follow that for several miles and the cemetery is near the road 
on the right behind a security fence.<br/>
</b></font></font>
<font color="#800000" face="Arial">This is a large Cemetery, under a clump of brushy 
trees. It is behind a tall security style fence of a large food consortium with 
keep out signs. The cemetery is next to the road, but no entrance is provided or 
allowed across the fence except thru locked gates and warning signs. There are 
hazardous materials operation warnings of processes in progress. Understandable. I am all for business progress but this is overboard as far as the cemetery 
being off 
limits is concerned. The visitor can walk to within 5 feet of the cemetery and 
not go 50 more feet to visit it. Since this security issue probably involves food 
safety I advise anyone wanting to visit this cemetery not to break any laws or 
rules here. Believe it is Frito Lay Company who are owners here or one of the 
big chip companies.</font><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b><br/>
