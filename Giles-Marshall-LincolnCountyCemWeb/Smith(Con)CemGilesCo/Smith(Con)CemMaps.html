  <b>Location: From Elkton take Ardmore Ridge 
		Road to Lewter Hollow Rd and turn left (north) on Loftin Hall Road and 
		go about 1 and 1/2 miles and to the top of the ridge. The cemetery is in 
		a tree lined thicket behind a house. You will go down the private 
		driveway passing the house before reaching the cemetery so this requires 
		permission. The owner took me there and helped me find all the stones in 
		the brushy thicket.<br/>

  This Aerial Map shows the cemetery more clearly in a clump of trees behind a private 
		home marked by a red check. The Google map marks the driveway 
		incorrectly. There is actually two driveways here so take the one 
		further south. The gentleman there (I do not name) had a common past. 
		Both of us were retired from manufacturing businesses. 
		Our paths along the way had crossed some. He in management and me in 
		accounting. He had retired and bought this farm many years ago and lives 
		now a quite life with an occasional consultation job.</b><i><b><br/>
