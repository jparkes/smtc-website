This aerial view shows the route to the Cook cemetery and the Joines Cemetery.
Once you see a barn on the left of Petty Hollow Road look left out to the
cemetery on the slope. You will
need permission from the owner. There are two gates to cross to get to the
cemetery; one at the barn and the other across a fence line and they both may be locked
with cattle in the area. The cemetery is inside a barb wire fence. Please travel quietly and give the
cattle ample space so they are not disturbed.
