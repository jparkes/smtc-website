This aerial view shows the route to the Cook cemetery and the Joines Cemetery.
Once you see a barn on the left of Petty Hollow Road look left out to the
cemetery on the slope. </font>You will
need permission from the owner. There are two gates to cross to get to the
cemetery; one at the barn and the other across a fence line and they both may be locked
with cattle in the area. The cemetery is inside a barb wire fence.&nbsp;Please travel quietly and give the
cattle ample space so they are not disturbed.<font size="3">
