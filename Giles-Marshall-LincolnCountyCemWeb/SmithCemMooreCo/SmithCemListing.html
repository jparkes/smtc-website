		This cemetery is caught up in the expansion of 
		Jack Daniels Distillery, but seems cared for, except for the weeds 
		growing very tall. I may have missed one stone but there are many 
		listings on Findagrave.com classified into this cemetery which are 
		really Smith Chapel Cemetery located elsewhere.</font></p>
