Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and turn east (left) on Bunker Hill Road. Follow 
that several miles and turn right (south) on Old Stage Coach Road. Old Stage 
Coach Road will terminate at junction of King &amp; Newman Roads. You will find yourself at a gate with 
multiple no-trespassing signs present into (old) King Road which evidently has 
been reverted to private land over time. Your journey probably ends here. The owner 
sadly has made it known he 
allows no visitors on this land.<br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery behind a rock wall. I cannot tell here if 
there are invasive trees or brush present in this cemetery. If you get 
permission please respect the 
crop being grown here and do not cross into the cemetery when crops are green 
and subject to being trampled upon.<br/>

From this Google view we see the cemetery in the distance looking west out from 
I-65. The dark spot in the field is probably the rock wall. This is about 600 
yards from I-65.<br/>
