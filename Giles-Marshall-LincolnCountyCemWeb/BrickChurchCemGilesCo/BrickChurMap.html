  From Nashville take I-65 South to Exit 22. Go left or southwest on Highway 31
  Alt toward Pulaski for about 1 mile. Pass the Brick Church Community sign and
  find the road that veers left off Highway 31 Alt called Clock Creek Road. Take
  that and just down the road on your left is the church and cemetery. That is
  also the road to the historic Lairdland Farm Bed &amp; Breakfast about 1/4
  miles further, a good place to stay.<br/>
