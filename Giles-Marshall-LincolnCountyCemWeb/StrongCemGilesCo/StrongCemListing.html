Virginia - died&nbsp; between 1851 &amp; 1859, Giles County Tenn., (wife of David S.

STRONG, W. N., 3 September 1846 - 13 June 1912<br>
</i></font>STRONG, William N., 3 Sep 1846 - 13 Jun 1912. (married Minda Whitmire 
on Dec 22 1875, in Giles; son of David &amp; Lucretia Strong. I do wonder if W.N was 
a natural son of David with his birth date being 1846 (unless that is wrong). 
That means His parents mother: Lucretia was age 73 when he was born and father: 
David was 72 years old. That is likely too old to bear children so maybe he is a 
grandchild of David &amp; Lucretia, and from a generation which is lost in unmarked 
graves. Another possibility was that William N., was an adopted child? [CWA 26 
Jan 2013])<br>

	<div>
		<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">Lucretia was born Oct 4 1773 
		VA, likely Campbell County, married David S. Strong May 30 1794 in 
		Campbell County Virginia.</font></div>
	<div>
		<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">I have David S Strong
		<strong>still in </strong>VA in <strong>1810, </strong>but by <strong>
		1820</strong> they are in <strong>Giles County. T</strong>his relocation 
		is identical to what I have for her sister Nancy and husband James 
		Maxey, so I am guessing that they migrated together with other family 
		members and/or friends.</font></div>
	<div>
		<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">Husband David S Strong died 
		in 1860 of &quot;old age&quot; according to the death record and was 86 years old 
		and a widower therefore we know Lucretia died before 1860. However we do 
		know that she is alive and age 76 yrs old in the 1850 census. So she 
		died sometime between 1850 &amp; 1860. </font></div>
	<div>
		<font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">David is shown on the 1860 
		Census Mortality Schedule so Lucretia not being on that schedule means 
		she died between the census years (1851-1859)<br>
		W.N. as you might imagine is their son William. He married Minda 
		Whitmeir, but I suspect it was actually Whitmire on Dec 22 1875 in Giles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		[Trish Brewer Boone, 25 Jan 2013]<br>
		<br>
		</font>
		<font size="2" face="Arial">From Trish a bit later: Opps I just noticed 
		that their son James was born in VA according to the 1850 census and he 
		was 37 making his birth in 1813 so they were still in VA in 1813. <br>
		<br>
		I was mistaken about an earlier factoid I sent I said W. N. was the son 
		of David and Lucretia. I was looking at the 1850 census to get that fact 
		for William on that census. Therefore I meant that William&nbsp; N. is 
		the son of James therefore the grandson of David &amp; Lucretia.&nbsp; So 
		this is their grandson and his wife buried here. Now where are the son 
		James and his wife buried? Well possibly in one of those unmarked 
		graves. <br>
		<br>
		I also noticed that Lucretia was 76 in 1850 and her son was 37 making 
		her 39 when he was born SO it is likely that James was their LAST child 
		and the ONLY one that migrated with them so perhaps there are lots of 
		other little Strongs that were already married and therefore stayed in 
		VA when the family migrated here </font></div>

Giles County Historical Society, page 503 dated 1986 and revised to include 
Jackie Adams identification and further clarification of two graves in this

family. I take no responsibility for that being correct. No supporting 
evidence was provided, but the assumption is reasonable based on the research by&nbsp; 
cousin Trish Brewer Boone. If you know where this
