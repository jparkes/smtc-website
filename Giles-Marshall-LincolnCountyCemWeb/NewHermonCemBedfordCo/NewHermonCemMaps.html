			coordinates of the New Hermon Cemetery, located in New Hermon. This 
			cemetery is not to be confused with the Mt Hermon Cemetery two miles 
			northwest of here.</font><font size="2"><br/>

			</font><font color="#000080" size="2">To find this cemetery go 
			southeast on Hwy 82 from Shelbyville Tennessee to Flat Creek. Turn 
			right on Center Church Road and almost immediately turn back left on 
			New Hermon Road and travel 2 miles and you will be in New Hermon, a 
			very old community. The cemetery is upon a hill above the village on 
			your left at the junction of Mullins Hollow &amp; New Hermon Rds. That 
			is past the Church on your left 150 yards.<br/>

			Here we see the New Hermon Cemetery marked with a red check. The new 
			Hermon Church is located north of the red check about 300 feet. I 
			think since this aerial photo was made the house that we see there 
			in the junction of the road was torn away and a trailer set in its 
			place. Also there was a hedge row between that torn down house and 
			the cemetery which was also cleared away. Access from Mullins Hollow 
			Road is difficult due to the steepness of the incline up the hill 
			and the lack of parking. Go around to the church and walk southeast 
			into the cemetery from an angle where the new signage is today.</font></font><i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b><br/>
