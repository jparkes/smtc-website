Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 431 to Petersburg &amp; turn right (East) on Hwy 129. 
Follow that several miles and turn north on Bledsoe Road and follow that for 
about 1 &amp; 1/2 miles and turn right into Poor Grab/Chestnut Ridge Rd. After a few 
hundred yards look for the Bledsoe aka Poor Grab Church of Christ building on 
the left and there is a field road on the left side of the church that takes you 
to the old house &amp; cemetery but the cemetery is in a clump of trees before you 
get to the house but on the left. The road takes you thru a gate that must be
