			go southeast on Hwy 82 from Shelbyville Tennessee to Flat Creek. 
			Turn right on Center Church Road and almost immediately turn back 
			left on New Hermon Road and travel 2 miles and you will be in New Hermon. Next turn right on the Mt Hermon Road and 
			go 3/4 mile and the 
			cemetery is upon a hill above a residence on the left.</b><br/>

			<b>With this photo I am showing you the clump of trees where the 
			Parker grave(s) is located according to mapping. I cannot confirm 
			this because I did not stop and visit this site. The actual GPS 
			takes one northwest up close to the top of that hill on the left 
			maybe in the middle of those cattle and I am inclined to believe 
			there is no monument up there. Therefore I will look first in that 
			clump of trees. If I am correct the GPS needs correcting.</b><br/>
