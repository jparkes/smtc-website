			<p><b>Large stack-stone limestone Slabs mark the 
			graves of unknown persons buried here. This cemetery is not 
			documented by anyone in the past. <br/>
			Typically these types tombs were in style from about 1820 to 1875.<br/>
			The only reason I gave this cemetery the name Parker cemetery is 
			because the lady who lives in the house across the road said the 
			folks that lived in their house a long time ago were the Parker 
			family. </b></p>

			Gammill Road..</i></p>
