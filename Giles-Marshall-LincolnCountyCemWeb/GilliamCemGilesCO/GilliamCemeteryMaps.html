placed. I have plotted the GPS to the best of my ability. <br/>

</b>The book Giles County Tennessee Cemeteries says the directions for 
finding this cemetery are: Go west from Pulaski on Hwy 64 and turn (right) north 
on Hwy 166 and go past Minnow Branch Road and the cemetery is on the right in a 
clump of trees. Further they say this is a large cemetery with many fieldstone 
marked graves among 4 listed marked headstones. <br/>
Thanks to Kristi Henson for pointing out this hard to find cemetery and Mr. 
Childress's patience for allowing me to park in his driveway. I accidentally 
went up the wrong road. The place is owned by Mr. Edward Henson and permission 
is necessary to visit.<br/>
