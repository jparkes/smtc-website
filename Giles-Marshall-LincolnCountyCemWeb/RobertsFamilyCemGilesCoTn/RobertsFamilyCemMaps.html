west on Highway 64 (toward Lawrenceburg) from Pulaski and turn (left) south on Johnson 
Branch Rd.  Go about 3.5 miles on that road and look for the Campbell's 
place with a thicket that juts out 
into a hay field from the surrounding forest. The Cemetery is about 100 yards out into the field from the road. Mr. Campbell who owns the property, 
is a very likeable gentleman, and can if available direct you to the cemetery which is </b></font>

Directions from Daniel Vaughn: The Bachelor Roberts Family 
Graveyard is on the property of Mr. Campbell. If you go down Johnson's Branch 
Road it will follow the valley floor for several miles before climbing to the 
top of the ridge. When you get to the top of the ridge there is a nice size hay 
field on the left. The first house you see on the left is a white house with a 
green metal roof. As you follow the road it will curve gently to the left and at 
the end of the hay field is a house with a nice size garage to the left of it. 
This is Mr. Campbell's home. He was very helpful in showing me the cemetery. 
There use to be an old Roberts family home to the right of the current white 
house. Mr Campbell told me that he grew up in the old house and use to play in 
the area around the cemetery.<br/>
