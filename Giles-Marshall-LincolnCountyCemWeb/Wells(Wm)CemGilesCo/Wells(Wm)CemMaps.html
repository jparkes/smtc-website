Go south on Hwy 31 from Pulaski and cross over Hwy 64 bypass. Continue on for 
nearly two more miles and turn right (west) on Crescent View Road. Proceed about 
� mile. and turn left (south) into the 1st driveway across Britton Branch for 
permission. From the house go across the pasture west to the clump of trees 
which contain the cemetery. That is about 250 yards nearly due west from the 
home. The cemetery is also very near Richard Johnston's house but to the east 
(but not on) his land.<br/>

This aerial &amp; GPS map shows the William Wells Cemetery under the Hackberry tree 
lined cemetery. It is out in a field in on the west side of a home and actually 
closer to Mr. Johnston's home on the east side. This is near Britton Branch 
Creek which I am sure served as a source of water for the Wells Family.<br/>
