In the death of Mrs. Rebecca McCracken Apr. 30, at her home in Bunker Hill, 
Giles County loses perhaps its oldest resident. Mrs. McCracken was born in 
Lincoln County, Nov. 30, 1809, her maiden name being Collins. She was married at 
the age of twenty-two to John Lytle McCracken, and moved to this county, where 
she has since resided. Her husband died in 1857.<br>
Mrs. McCracken was survived by none of her five children, but at her burial were 
eleven grandchildren, and fifteen great-grandchildren, and two 
great-great-grandchildren. She is survived by one sister, Mrs. Harriet Wright, 
aged eighty-seven years.<br>
The burial was in the family graveyard at the old home place.</font><i><font size="4" color="#800000" face="Courier New"><br>
