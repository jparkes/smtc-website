MAYS, Calvin The Pulaski Citizen 06 Feb 1902 Indian Creek "Hill Billy"<br/>
The friends of Calvin Mays here were painfully shocked to hear of his death 
which occurred at Spring Hill Saturday night after a brief illness of pneumonia. 
Calvin was a noble young man and well thought of by every body. To the family we 
extend sympathy an despecialy to his aged grandmother, Mrs. Rebecca McCracken 
who raised him from infancy who is past 92 years of age and quite feeble at this 
time. The body was laid to rest at the family burying ground at 10:30 Monday.
