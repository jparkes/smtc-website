Go south from Shelbyville on Hwy 231 pass Center Church Road access on your left
and keep on until you get to the Robinson Road access on the right. Turn right
(northwest)
there and the road will bend back left or (almost due west) and a brick home
will be on your left after you travel about 1/4 mile further. Go into the driveway and the owner will direct you to
behind their house in a hedge row that spans north/south directly behind their
home about 200 yards. There was at one time a dedicated field road to the
cemetery but it has faded into the dust.<br/>
