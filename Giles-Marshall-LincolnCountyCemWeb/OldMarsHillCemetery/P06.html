Hannah Patterson, Born 1774, Died Nov 28, 1847 �Mother of Thomas Ross�.
Hannah Kennedy married first to Thomas Ross, then 2nd Francis Herron, and then
3rd to Thomas Patterson. She only had one child, Thomas Ross, by her first
husband. Her 3rd husband, Thomas Patterson, had been married to a Hannah Adams
first and they had children together. I am not sure where Thomas Patterson is
buried but I assume in Bedford County. Hannah either moved to Marshall County to
be close to her son, Thomas, after her husband's death, or county lines just
changed. I do know that in the listings I have found that there is no grave
listed for Thomas Patterson in the Old Mars Hill Cemetery. [Rick Gray 7/26/06].
Rick I my research corroborates your conclusion that Thomas is not here unless
he is in an unmarked grave. [WA]  <i>Photo
