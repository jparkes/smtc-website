I'm trying to re-locate William Abernathy's grave in the William Abernathy 
Cemetery in Giles Co, TN. About 15 years ago I found it in the weed/bushes on 
Stovall Rd. Unfortunately I did not make pictures or record the exact location. 
Recently I've been back twice to find it to no avail. Does anyone know WHERE on 
Stovall Rd this is located? A GPS would be awesome to have! My memory is that it 
is about 100 ft from the road and in a curve. Thanks for any help anyone can 
give me. Dixie Waters, dswdew@bellsouth.net</span><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Added

Dixie I have him listed without a headstone in the Wm. Abernathy Cemetery. That 
is probably because that is how the Giles Co. Cemetery book had him listed . 
However, they acknowledged there was no re-survey because it was grown up. </span></strong></p>

Sorry you cannot find that location, because that probably explains why I could 
not find a headstone in the William Abernathy Cemetery, because there was not one.</span></strong></p>

There is only one large bend in the Stovall Road. Remember which way the road 
bent? This awfully long URL should take you to a bend in the Stovall Road. If 
you can detail the spot from memory it would be a way to get the GPS. This is 
the best GPS map out there in general use:</span></strong></p>

				My family and I (14 of us) recently toured the cemeteries of 
				Giles Co that had our blood line kin in them (5 cemeteries in 
				all). First I�ve learned via a descendant (Lisa) of Wm Abernathy 
				(1742-1832) who via her mother owns the �Abernathy farm� at 
				1600(?) Amos Hamlett Rd.  She maintains the cemetery in their 
				side yard and does a great job; <b>her mother is sure there used 
				to be a stone there for the above Wm</b>.  Lisa lives in 
				Hartselle, AL but goes to the farm occasionally, plus she rents 
				the farm to a nearby farmer.  <br/>
				Have I mentioned to you about knocking on the door of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
				�red roof� house on Stovall Rd. The resident was a �civil war 
				re-enactor� and stated there was no cemetery between he and the 
				1<sup>st</sup> red roof house.  I know you�ve probably done more 
				research on this than I, so if you have thoughts on this let me 
				know.  For interest sake I did relate to my relatives the Amos H 
				Rd place is where Wm b. 1742 is buried.</span></p>

				Second, regarding  Bee Spring cemetery and John Abernathy 
				1785-1861:  I had my niece take pictures of the old broken 
				marker beside the new one; she was to put it on the Find a Grave 
				but I don�t see it yet or maybe one can�t replace the photo 
				already on there? (not a problem) Anyway I have contacted her; 
				have not heard back yet.  If she is having a problem, we may 
				call on you to help?</span></p>

 <p>Wow must have been fun to go exploring cemeteries like that. I had one 
		time like that years ago. No I have done less than you on this Stovall 
		Road Cemetery query, but thought it looked like a cem on Google maps 
		between the 2nd red roof house and a red roof shed behind it, but 
		nevertheless if the guy there did not know of a cemetery that close to 
		his house then case closed, as it must not be there. He is not likely to 
		have wanted to deceive you. But you mentioned in your earlier query 
		Stoval Road leaving me to go roaming Google maps looking for it, but now 
		deny it so or disclaim it so OK. I do though follow all leads to find 
		lost cemeteries and many of them have dead ends as it seems this one 
		does. C. Wayne Austin 11 Jun 2015</p></div>
