<p align="center"><b>BLACK (Alexander) GRAVE
SITE, GILES COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br/>
<img border="0" height="551" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/Black(Alex)CemGilesCo/BlackAlex1878Map.jpg" width="579"/><br/>
A. (Alexander II &amp; perhaps I) Black home locations can be seen inside the
yellow circles as owning 230 acres each. This likely was the home sites of Alexander
Black 1st and Alexander Black 2nd each at 230 acres. Since Pulaski has expanded
to the north the today's cemetery is difficult to place based on this map.<br/>

This map shows inside a yellow circled highlighted area an area marked off as
the home-site and also gravesites of Alexander Black (I) born 1777;
Alexander Black (II) born abt 1810.<br/>

This Topographical Map shows the area of the cemetery. This cemetery is not placed by
GSIS mapping. The coordinates are Latitude 35.21398 degrees North, Longitude
87.04803 degrees West. This is my best estimate and may contain small errors.<br/>

Going west out of town up Madison St. one merges into Rocky Road. Go down Rocky
Road Hill and just before coming to the Intermet Factory on the right (which is
closed now) you will see a private road that turns right. An old house probably
connected with the Alexander Black family somehow is in the thickets abandoned, but there
is 1st a newer brick house on the right of the road
after you turn. That is the Bugg Home. I think it is the Joe M. Bugg instead of
Stancil Bugg according to the Telephone Book. Go past the entrance to the Bugg
home and the road will begin to bend around. As you bend sharply right at the
end of the road is today a long trailer or modular house which faces due west.
The cemetery will be straight behind that house about 240 feet or 80 yards. To the east of the
cemetery is an open field. The Buggs' know where the cemetery is and can explain
the location from their house. Mr Bugg runs an electrical company at 325 W.
College Street.<br/>

From here we can see the Old home probably connected to the Alexander Black
family somehow as I judge it to be old enough. I think two modular houses have
been aligned end to end to form one long home and the cemetery is due east of
that home about 240 feet or 80 yards. Looks like from the above Arial map
someone at one time mowed a zigzag area to the cemetery but that is now grown up
in briars now.Â
