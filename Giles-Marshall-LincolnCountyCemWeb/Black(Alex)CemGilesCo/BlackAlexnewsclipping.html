Justices (of Peace), page 73 - Monday March 7, 1814.&nbsp;<br>
First time I have seen Squire Black's name.
He was The grandfather of Mrs. John Hollins, Mrs. Brown Buford, Mrs. Eugene Anderson,
Alex (III) etc. He lived west of town on the Campbellsville road leading out by
Kellum's Gap afterwards owned by B F McGrew and W A Malone, Mr. Black is buried there, but
I have never seen his grave. I doubt if any of his grandchildren ever did. I don't know
whether the graveyard is kept repaired or not or any grave markers are there.</font></font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
