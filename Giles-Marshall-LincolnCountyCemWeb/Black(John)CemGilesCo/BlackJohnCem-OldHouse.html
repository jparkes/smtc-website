 This old house was in the Black family, it was kind of
under the hill across the road from the old pre-civil war barn. Best I (contributor, who lived
near here) remember hearing there was at one time a brick house here that was burned
during the
Civil War. John Black died before the Civil War (1855) and Helen married a Tarpley man.
John's father, Robert is also buried in this cemetery. This house was moved over
to and restored near HWY 166 or just off it a few years ago for Jimmy Black's daughter.</font><font color="#000080" size="2"><i><br/>
