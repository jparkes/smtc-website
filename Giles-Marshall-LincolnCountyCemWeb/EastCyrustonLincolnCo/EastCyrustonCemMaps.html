  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: From Fayetteville go west on Hwy 
		64 to Old Elkton Pike and turn south (left) and follow that for about 7 
		miles and look to you left at a cattle ranch with barns and silos and 
		fences. Turn into the driveway with permission/notification and as you 
		go toward the barns you will see the cemetery in a thicket straight 
		ahead of you. Follow the road around the barn and park on the (opposite) south side 
		of the barn and go into the gate closing it behind you. Walk along 
		beside the barn (going north) to the cemetery. Turn right as you bump into the fence 
		row of the cemetery and follow along the cemetery fence row to the gate 
		on the south eastern corner of the cemetery. This cemetery is subject to 
		being locked up behind gates so you may have to deal with that. There is 
		a large cattle operation going on here so be prepared to get by that 
		without disturbing the livestock or damaging anything. These operations 
		are very fussy about keeping the cattle behind fences and away from the 
		highways.<br/>
