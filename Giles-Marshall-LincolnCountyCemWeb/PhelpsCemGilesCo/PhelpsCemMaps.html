  From the above map detail we see the Phelps Cemetery GPS location. This 
cemetery is not shown on some current map services. It was on the old topography 
maps maintained by USGS. GPS plotting by C. Wayne Austin.<br/>

  <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>Location: Take Highway 64 west from Pulaski 
and turn north after a mile on Hwy 166 (Campbellsville Road). Travel that for 
about 5 miles along the pristine Richland Creek valley farming community. Pass 
by the Wales Community. When 
the road starts to climb a large hill look to your right for a locked farm gate. 
The cemetery is about 1/4 miles due north behind that gate. Notice this map 
above shows the cemetery and farm road. Just before you reach the cemetery there 
will be a large farm pond on your left as seen in the map below. If you pass 
Wales Estate Road you have traveled too far. There is actually two gates with 
access into farm roads on the left in that area so don't go to the wrong one as 
the other one goes directly to a house. I am not aware if this is a private or 
public cemetery but the locked gates reminds me someone thinks it is private.<br/>
