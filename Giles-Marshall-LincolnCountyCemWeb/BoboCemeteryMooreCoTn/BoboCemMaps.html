  This Aerial Map shows the area I have roughly outlined as the Bobo Cemetery 
area where the cemetery resides. One can see the faint outline of the stones 
under the trees here. The caretaker is doing a great job of keeping this 
cemetery maintained. This in no way represents a legal boundary.<br/>
