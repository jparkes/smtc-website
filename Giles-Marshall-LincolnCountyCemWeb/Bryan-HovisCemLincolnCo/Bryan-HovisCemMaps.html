This map shows the GPS coordinates of the Bryan Cemetery.
It is mislabeled as the Bryant Cemetery on all major maps as it is above.Â <br/>

Location: From the state line going north on Old Railroad Bed Road and turn right 
(east) on Coldwater Creek Rd to Molina Road and turn (left) north. Follow 
that for just over one mile and turn right into the Cemetery Road which also doubles 
as a road to the area homes there. The cemetery is in a grove of trees 300 yards 
up the slope on the left. Currently the cemetery is maintained. <br/>

This aerial map from Google shows the cemetery on the north side of the road 
marked Cemetery Road. An outline was drawn in yellow but I am not aware if the 
lines are the same as the perimeter of the cemetery. <br/>
