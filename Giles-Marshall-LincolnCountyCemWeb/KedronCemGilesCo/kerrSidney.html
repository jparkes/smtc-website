  </font><b><font color="#BB2206" size="2">Story goes that sometime after <a href="../StellaCemetery/kerrSam.html"> Samuel
  Kerr's</a> wife Anna Paisley Kerr died Samuel heard a suspicious noise in his hen
  house. When he went to investigate he was confronted by a robber who shot him.
  Though he survived he was bedfast for a time and Sarah/(Sidney S.) Ball came
  to nurse him back to health. They fell in love and married. However, soon
  afterward the
  marriage fell apart and Sarah moved back with her family. Kerr Family legend said she did
  so when she found out she was not substantially included in Samuel Kerr's will
  though we find she was willed a small partial of land near her home in Kedron. We find Sarah Kerr as Sidney S. Kerr
  interred beside her family in the Kedron Cemetery a few miles northeast of
  this place.Â </font></b>
