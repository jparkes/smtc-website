</b></font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>Location: From 
Fayetteville go north on Hwy 231 several miles to Cold Spring Road and turn left 
or northwest. Travel that past Union Hollow Road and turn right into a driveway 
branching northeast away from Cold Springs Road and get permission at the home 
to visit this cemetery. Careful don't let the horses out. What I found was 
frustrating. I walked around in a tall Johnson Grass weeds area for 15 minutes before finally finding two stones fallen and almost 
completely covered in soil. It had been many years since anyone had attempted to 
keep these monuments from sinking below the ground and disappearing.<br/>

This is what I found and what I scrounged around thinking the stones were 
likely to be found near the remaining section of the wrought iron fence but then 
the lady told me some of the stones were out a ways north of the fence, but still they 
were hard to find. Since all this is pasture it would do no good to set them up 
because they would be knocked over again.<br/>
