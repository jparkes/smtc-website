Citizen 08 Jun 1905<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Annie Abernathy, wife of M. T. Abernathy, and eldest daughter of Rev. John 
H. Birdsong, deceased, after a lingering illness of many months, departed this 
life May 24th, 1905, aged 54 years.<br/>
A good woman has left us. A kind and affectionate wife, a loving and tender 
mother will be missed in the home made happy by her affable, gentle nature.<br/>
To the bereaved husband and children, I deeply sympathize with you in the loss 
of the dearest friend on earth to you, but rejoice in her gain. Few such noble 
women bless the many homes of our land. You have many reasons to be grateful.<br/>
Annie is not dead, but sleepeth, and on the Resurrection Morn, will rise in that 
splendor and beauty to an eternal home with God.<br/>
Children! Emulate her noble character, and you will live with her again. Mother 
can't come back to you, but you can go to her.<br/>
Annie died in the full assurance that her home would be with Jesus, whom, in 
early life she learned to love and serve. God has called a prize home. So you 
have attraction to draw you Heavenward. Therefore mourn for her, not as lost, 
but saved with an eternal Salvation.<br/>
"Beyond this vale of tears - There is a life above, Unmeasured by the flight of 
years, And all that life is love." P. J. A.<br/>
