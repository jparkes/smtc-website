This map shows the cemetery upon the side of a slope just inside the edge of the
tree line pointed out with a yellow pointer. From Highway 129 at Robertson Fork travel south on Robertson Fork
Road a few hundred yards and turn east (left) on Hyde Road. Follow that road for
about 2/3 of a mile and look upon the bank on your left for the cemetery inside
the edge of the tree line about 60 to 75 yards from the road. The stones can be
seen from the road only in the wintertime. The cemetery will be visible to you
just before the tree line begins again along the left side of a field. Once the
tree line begins you have traveled too far. When you approach the cemetery a
large triangular shaped pond will be on your right. You can see it on this
Aerial Map. All this is private land.<br/>
