  From the above map we see the Bethel Cemetery GPS location. Actually 
Fayetteville is the nearest Town about 5 miles northeast from here.  <br/>

</b>

  <b>Location: Take Highway 64 out of 
Fayetteville and go several miles and turn south (left) on Old Bethel Road. Go 
about 1 and 1/2 miles and the cemetery is on your right just before you reach 
Gunter Hollow Road.</b><img border="0" height="451" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWebImages/BethelCemLincolnCo/BethelCemAerial.jpg" width="1011"/><b><br/>
  This Aerial Map shows the plot where the cemetery resides next Old Bethel Road 
indicated with a yellow pointer. Most of the cemetery is in the clearing but 
parts are in the tree line west and south of the clearing. This is a very old 
and fragile cemetery with stones easily damaged by overzealous people so be 
gentle on these soft monuments if you have business here. <br/>
