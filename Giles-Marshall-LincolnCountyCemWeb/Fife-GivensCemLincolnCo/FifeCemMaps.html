</b><b>Location: From 
Taft Tennessee go east toward Fayetteville about 5 miles and turn north on 
Carmago Road. Follow that until it comes to the Carmago Church of Christ where 
the road becomes McDeal Road. Follow that another mile and look right upon the 
bank of the road at a tree and under that is the three fallen &amp; broken box tombs and two upright 
monuments, one no longer complete enough to be readable. The cemetery is between 
two driveways about 500 yards apart.</b><b><br/>

This aerial map shows the cemetery on the right of the road after one passes a
