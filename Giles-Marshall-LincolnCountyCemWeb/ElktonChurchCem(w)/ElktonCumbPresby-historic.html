<b>Here we can see a more detailed drawing of the cemetery 
in its prime.  This is the church, rock enclosure, tombs and streets needed 
for access to the old Cumberland Presbyterian 
Church &amp; Cemetery. All this is barely discernable today. The only thing present 
today are a few fallen &amp; broken box tombs &amp; the rock wall enclosure along with a 
few scattered and broken gravestones. The Rock enclosure is in severe danger of 
falling as trees both prop it up as press on its sides leaning it further toward 
that ultimate day when about 20 tons of it will come crashing to the ground 
burying anything around it. The average stone making up that rock wall weighs at 
least 1/2 to a ton.<br/>
