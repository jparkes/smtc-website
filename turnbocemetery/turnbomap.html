We have corrected this calculation as 87.17432 degrees West and 35.46434 
degrees North from other sources where we have seen it as incorrectly placed. I have placed a red check at the correct location.</br>

This map shows the 
Turnbo cemetery in the center of the map and it is my position that it is 
slightly wrong as placed on this map.</b><center>
<b>Directions: Go south from 
Mt Pleasant Tennessee on Hwy 166 (Enterprise Road) and pass Enterprise. 
Continuing on south of Enterprise from the Old Enterprise School, brown brick, Building)
Community Center on left go about 1/4 mile until the road bends back (leftward) eastward. 
Just after that, look to your right upon
the bank of the road and you should see a Loblolly pine Tree and a decaying
Cedar tree amidst a small clump of brush. There just ahead of you also on the 
right is a big barn. There are two small upright markers about 15 feet west from 
the Cedar. The old barn is about 100 yards southwest of the two stones which are 
hard to see in the summer when the weeds are grown up. Also the hillock where 
the cemetery sits will obscure your view of the two stones.The road into the 
cemetery also serves as a road into the barn lot and indicates private property.<i></br>

Turnbow Cemetery as seen
from Hwy 166 looking north and closer up. Memorials are visible here denoted by
the black arrow pointing downward. The stones look like fence post from here.</br>

I am giving you a variety of looks to help find this little cemetery, because it is 
hard to find. Without the help of neighbors I would probably have never spotted 
it because of the mapping error. I am not sure if the error is in USGS mapping.</br>
