<p align="center"><b>TURNBOW
(JAMES) FAMILY CEMETERY, ENTERPRISE, MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
An endangered
Cemetery<br/>
<br/>
</b>This is an endangered cemetery
but one that has been well recorded within the genealogical circles. The
cemetery is highly visible but neglected. The markings are now faint and
probably will not last many more years. The marker to the north belongs to James
Turnbo(w) and the one on the south (of James' memorial) belongs to Fecilia
(Coffee) Turnbo(w), his wife. There are several <b><a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/turnbocemetery/IMG_4290.JPG">stones around the base 
of the old Cedar tree</a></b> which at one time probably marked graves of other relatives or perhaps
friends. A nice little rule there is to never move a stone in a cemetery without at
least making a permanent record, whether it is a common rock or an elaborate
tombstone, unless one is convinced they are restoring a stone to its original
place. <br/>
