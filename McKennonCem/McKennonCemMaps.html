<b>
From Columbia take Williamsport Pike and go five miles beyond Baker School. Turn south on a farm
lane (the second lane on left beyond Viola Baptist Church on your left) and go about three fourths of a mile. 
Stop and walk east but in a bit of a southward direction. Climb up Monument Hill 
to the top. Follow the top ridge east until it turns more south east and then 
when that ridge top bends further south follow that to the cemetery on the east 
side of the top of the ridge, but before one begins to seriously descend back 
down the hilltop.</br>
As stated this hill is called Monument Hill and the cemetery
is on the south end of its snake shaped ridge and might be better located in 
February-March
when the leaves and weeds are low. The cemetery will be 170 meters or about 186 
yards due west of the pound center of the pond, but slightly north of that 
point. Pond shown above in the clearing.</b></br>
