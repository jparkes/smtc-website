<b>Much of t</b><b>he above information was given to Fred Hawkins by Sara Tom McKennon and her
husband Jimmy, during 1987. Tom &amp; Sara McKennon had been there a few years 
earlier and said that the cemetery would be practically impossible to find 
without a guide. The area was stripped by phosphate mining operations and was 
allowed to grow up in bushes and trees. However, according to topographical maps 
on this web the cemetery site was not harmed by phosphate mining? The area all 
around the Monument Hill was though.</br>
</br>
I have not visited this cemetery either. It is in the deep forest
and upon a hill top. The GPS Coordinates appear to be correct making the job of 
finding this cemetery easier using Delorme Map devices on a laptop. This GPS 
software is activated from a Satellite. (always on-anywhere).

<b>Genealogical records: After the death of Elizabeth McKennon in
1845, a case was brought in
Chancery Court, McKennon vs McKennon in which the following children were
mentioned; William; Daniel M.; Catherine, wife of James McFadden; Elizabeth,
wife of John M. Faris; and James, but earlier mentions in a request for Rev War 
pension Daniel a son mentions 8 children: William (1776-1856), Mary Ann (1785 - 
unknown), Elizabeth Farris (dates unknown), Catherine McFadden (1786 - unknown), 
Jane (1787-1860), John (1791-1862), James (dates unknown) &amp; Daniel (1791-1865)</br>
</br>
** John McKennon's grave site is unknown, after the war he 
went back home to South Carolina where he had previously married in 1775 to 
Elizabeth Nichols. He died in Feb 1803 according to Elizabeth. </br>
There is a cenotaph (He lived from 1745 to Feb 1803) in his honor in the 
Cantrell Gilliand Memorial Garden in </b><b>
Spartanburg County, South Carolina.</b><b> 
May that memorial serve as an expression of the gratitude we owe him for risking 
his life and braving the unknown to help build a new country: our beloved 
America.</br>
