<P align=center><b>HARDISON
(Robert) CEMETERY, Rock Springs Rd., MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</b></P>
<p><b>Directions 1987: On Rock Springs Rd., about 1 1/4 miles north of Baptist Church. Located on
the Coleman Williams place, which was the old Wilburn Hardison and later the Horace
Hardison farm. From the house, cross pasture to wooded hillside. The cemetery is
in upper edge of woods.</br>
Directions 2008: Many of the above descriptions are long since gone. The old
house no longer stands. That leaves us with instructions assuming the mapping
coordinates are correct. Go south on Rock Springs Road for three and 1/4 miles
and the cemetery is back in the easterly direction on a hillside. You will need
permission to take the private road at the top that connects to Rock Springs Rd.
in the bottom aerial view on this site. It spans southward toward this abandoned
cemetery.</b>

This cemetery listing was listed in the various books of the past. Mr. Fred
Lee Hawkins in the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries listed with the help of Rev. Dwain Brown 14 Mar 1986 on page 107. Before that
it was listed in the book They Passed This way page C-41, about 1967.&nbsp;While

with various ancestral books some of it having common original sources.&nbsp; [Wayne Austin
