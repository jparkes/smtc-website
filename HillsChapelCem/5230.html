PARKER, John E., 24
May 1894 - 24 Feb 1946.<br/>
PARKER, Mrs. Bell Kelley, "70, died Thursday 25 Mar 1954 (actually 21 Jan 
1954); daughter of Rufus
Morgan and Martha Jane Holt Kelley; native of Maury Co.; married to John E.
Parker (Daily Herald, 29 Mar 1954.) She is interred as stated below in this 
Certificate of Death. Evidently Bell does not have a marker. We
conveniently list her with her husband in this cemetery. Hopefully this is what 
she would have wanted.<br/>
