sign makes no mention of the original name assigned &amp; kept by historians who
named it the Hills Chapel Cemetery. This cemetery was founded and at first
affiliated with the Baptist Church that stood near here in the latter part of
the 19th century. It now has the same name as that of the Cross Bridges
(Methodist Church) Cemetery next to the old Methodist Church on Hampshire Pike.
That is south Cross Bridges Road in the photo.<i><br>
