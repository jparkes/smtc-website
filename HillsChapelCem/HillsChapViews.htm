Panning the camera south to east from near the northwest corner of the cemetery.
The last two photos were taken pointing the camera northeast to east from the
southwest corner of the cemetery. Unique stones can be picked out from these
photos and will aid you in knowing where specific stones are located in a
cemetery. One can gain familiarity with these photos to determine the location
just from the backside of all the stones in a cemetery and label them with the
individual photos. I hope we have made it easy enough that it does not take a
prolific memory or a keen eye for detail to do that.&nbsp;<i><br>
