<i>To interpret this historical Rev.
William O. Roberts stood for values not widely popular around and even after the
Civil War 1861 - 1865 in this area. That is freedom for all along with religious
&amp; good moral values. I am sure he was also against the civil war. Those
principles were usually bound together. He was of the age whereby he had to make
a choice of which side he would fight on, but may have been a "Minister of
the Gospel." In those days the Republican party stood staunchly for ending
slavery as they do today. Oddly it was the Democrats that promoted
slavery. <br/>
