<b>From Athendale, go west on
Roberts Bend Road for three miles. The old church building is on the right of
road and the cemetery is beside it.Â <br/>
Interestingly there is an old road bed leading up to the church that is cut deep
into the ground. That is caused by the wagon wheels of horse drawn carriages
carving into the ground as happened in the olden days before roads were bedded
with rock. It comes in from the northeast side almost parallel with the new
road. Parts of it can be seen in this aerial view as small ruts running
northeast/southwest on the left of the green lake. That road went obsolete prior
to the 1950s as it is not shown on the topographical map above which was drawn
up then.</b><b><br/>
