<b>Unknown old house in a decaying state in the
neighborhood of this cemetery. Likely one of the inhabitants of this cemetery
lived here. This is a very large house with the porch &amp; chimneys fallen
away. I would remind you this is private property so respect that if you are in
this neighborhood.&nbsp;</br>
