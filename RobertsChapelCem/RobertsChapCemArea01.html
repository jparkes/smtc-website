The cemetery signage for Roberts Chapel Cemetery at one time called the Sedberry
Cemetery. Oddly there are no marked stones here with that surname. We know they
lived nearby because they donated land for this cemetery plot. <br/>

<b>This is a view that
shows the beautiful array of plant growth here. I call the low plants that bloom
white &amp; yellow Daffodils but here in the south they are commonly known as Buttercups.
The white blooming shrub is called Bridal Bush or Bridal Wreath according
to Linda a descendent of the interred in this cemetery who reminded me of that
in an E-mail 2 Oct 2009.<br/>

 Here we can see the old church building in the background against the
backdrop of memorial stones and overgrown plant growth. I inspected it and from
what I can tell the architecture appears to be to be original as early as around
1840. The use of narrow tack boards inside is an old feature along with the
window size and styles.  <br/>

This is a closer view of the old declining church building. It has been used as
a barn for a lot of years but will not stand much longer given the abuse it is
taking. The roof is no longer
intact which is letting water get into the timbers inside and that will hasten
the decay. Of course the open windows allow birds to infest the inside
allowing dirt and other critters to build up and inhabit the interior. <br/>
 This is not a typical old time church
building with twin doors to separate the genders as was a common southern custom in
olden times. <br/>
I don't know but it seems to me that the building should be as public property
as the cemetery and should not be used as private property. If the roof were
repaired it would still stand another 200 years given no catastrophic events. We
know the Sedberry's donated this property to the church &amp; cemetery so how
did it get back into private use?<br/>
