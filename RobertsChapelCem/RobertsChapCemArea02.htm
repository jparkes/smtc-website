This view looks west at most of the cemetery but it is a bit obscured by the
shrub growth being too tall.</br>

<b>Here is the corner of the
wrought iron fence with the red flowering plant in the background. We can also
see the large lake in the background. We are looking northwest.</b></font><b>&nbsp;</br>

In this final view from just inside the cemetery we can see the old church
building. Someone in the past tried to at least save the building by boarding
the windows and keeping the roof repaired, but no more. It is called creeping degradation.
Each generation does a little less than the previous one to maintain such
property until one day is it too late.&nbsp;This was certainly a historic
structure and should have been preserved as a part of the cemetery.</br>
