</font><font color="#000080"  size="2">This photo shows the
signage of the Hargrave Cemetery. According to the sign on the pole this road is private. This is really an extended family cemetery so
permission to visit is
in order by outsiders. If you go there visit with love, respect &amp; appreciation for
those gone before. Visitation for any other reason will bring an alert
response from the community toward swift disciplinary action. This is also a
fenced and gated cemetery so by all means keep that closed.</font><font color="#000080"  size="3"><br>

This is a broader view of the entrance area showing the lime graveled road on
our right and the cemetery sign in the center of the photo. The sign says
founded in 1800. If true that means this cemetery was in use prior to the mass
influx of settlers from the east across the Blue Ridge and other mountain chains
to the east about 1805. Though the land belonged to the Indians there were white
settlers here successfully thriving long before the major treaties that opened
up this land to all.&nbsp;</font><font color="#000080"  size="3"><br>
