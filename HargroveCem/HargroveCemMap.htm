Kedron Pike, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HargroveCem/HargroveTopozone.jpg" width="417" height="360"><br>
</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This old
Topographical map dated in the 1950s shows the the cemetery as placed by
Longitude and Latitude coordinates in two places. The further up one (or northern
one) is wrong and is based on incorrect USGS mapping. The southern red check is my
corrected placement and shows the cemetery on one of the highest elevation
(hilltop) points at 760 - 780 around.&nbsp;<br>
 I believe the road to this cemetery is actually
private. This is really an extended family cemetery so permissions to visit are in
order by outsiders. If you go there visit with love, respect &amp; appreciation for
those gone before. A visitation for any other reason will bring an alert
response of the community toward swift disciplinary action.</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><br>

We have placed two yellow pointers on the above map. The one further north (up)
is at the incorrect place and represents the USGS mapping position of this cemetery
or at least the TOPOZONE Mapping Service's placement. The corrected yellow southern
pointer
is the actual located position of this cemetery. One can see the rectangular layout of
the cemetery from this map under the tip of the pointer.</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><br>
