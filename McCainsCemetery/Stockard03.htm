  I just wanted to let it be 
  known that</strong><strong> 
  Alice Stockard is buried at McCain's Cumberland Presbyterian. She and Robert 
  Stockard are interred there in unmarked graves.</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp; 
  On one of my trips down I found the location of the graves in their site map 
  that they have at the gate, but it is no longer there. They are buried
  </strong><strong>next to his parents, Joel Brevard (J.B.) Stockard and 
  Margaret Anderson (Margaret M.) Stockard , and his sister Susan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"></br>
  Also according to an obituary that I&nbsp;found at the archives </strong><strong>
  James Stockard a&nbsp;four yr old son of Mr and Mrs Robt. Stockard of Bear Creek 
  Pike who died on 3 Oct 1901 is interred at McCains Cemetery.</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"> 
  I did find that the family lived near there at that time, so I am assuming he 
  is my kin. Yes, according to the obit</strong><strong> he is buried at 
  McCains.</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400"></br>
  &nbsp;</br>
  I do not have a date of death for Robt. Stockard. I know that he died after 
  the 1910 census, and Alice is listed as a widow in the 1920 census. I am 
  guessing that he passed prior to the issuance of death certificates, so that 
  is between 1910 and 1914? </br>
  </strong><strong>Stockard, Robert, died about 1912, birth known (husband of 
  Alice McDonald Stockard). (unmarked grave)</br>
  Stockard, James, died about 3 Oct 1901, birth about 1897, (son of Robert 
  Stockard; unmarked grave)</strong><p>
