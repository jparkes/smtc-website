</i>Adkisson Eliza (abt 1831) - 3/20/1859</br>
</br>
Eliza Adkisson was born abt 1831 according to the 1850 census. Her maiden name 
was Eliza V Craig. She was the first of 5 wives married to John G Adkisson. I 
found the inscription you noted from the headstone interesting as I did find a 
marriage certificate for John G and Eliza. They were married Mar 20, 1849 in 
Maury County, TN. </br>
