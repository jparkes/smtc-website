R. Moore, 81, long-time Alabama banking executive, died Saturday, Dec. 16, 2006,
at his residence on Columbia Highway in the Lynnville Community.</br>
</br>
Services were conducted at 1 p.m. Wednesday Dec 23, 2006 at Oakes &amp; Nichols
with the Rev. Scott Sessions, the Rev. Dallas Baggett and the Rev. Douglas
Hendon officiating. Burial was in the historic McCains Cemetery in Maury County. A
memorial service was also conducted at 11 a.m. Saturday at the First Church of
the Nazarene in Sheffield, Ala. where Noel &amp; his family were members for so
many years. The family visited with friends from 4-8 p.m. Tuesday and again from
11-1 p.m. Wednesday at the Oaks &amp; Nichols funeral home.</br>
</br>
Noel was born and reared in the Culleoka Community of Maury County, he was the
son of the late Carter Timmons Moore and Elizabeth Stacy Moore who also lye here
in this cemetery.&nbsp;<br clear="all">
</br>
He spent most of his adulthood living in Tuscumbia Alabama. His home was near
the late Senator Howell Heflin's in the historic district of Tuscumbia, Alabama.</br>
</br>
He was a 1944 graduate and valedictorian of Culleoka High School and the School
of Banking of the South at Louisiana State University. He began his banking
career in 1945 with Commerce Union Bank in Columbia. In 1948 he became
associated with First National Bank of Tuscumbia, Ala. He remained there until
1977 when he became Executive Vice President of Bank Independent in Sheffield,
Alabama. He served in that position until retirement in 1990, continuing as a
member of the Board of Directors until his death.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
He was a long-time active member of the First Church of the Nazarene in
Sheffield, Alabama furthering a religious tradition which began with his
grandmother Alice Kerr Stacy and her sister Otie Kerr Austin back in the early
1900s. Survivors include his wife of 56 years, Jacquelyn Grayson Moore of
Lynnville; a daughter, Patricia L. Moore of Houston, Texas; two sons, David N.
(Cheryl H.) Moore of Americus, Ga. and Carter G. (Pamela E.) Moore of Lynnville;
four grandchildren, Brian E. (Sandi) Moore, William C. Moore, Jason N. Moore,
and Jared L. Moore; a great-grandchild, Alexander G. Moore; a sister, Pauline
Moore Holcomb of Columbia; two brothers, Loftin V. (Margaret) Moore of Lynnville
and O'Neil D. (Joyce) Moore of Columbia and several nieces and nephews.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
Active pallbearers were Brian E. Moore, William C. Moore, Jason N. Moore, Jared
L. Moore, Doug McCormack and Gary Cox. Honorary pallbearers included Jimmy
Price, Jerry Wages and members of the Board of Directors of Bank Independent of
Sheffield, Alabama.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
Memorials may be made to First Church of the Nazarene Building Fund, 1515 East
27th Street, Sheffield, Alabama 35660.</br>
</br>
As a banker Noel's credentials were well respected. He was one of the few
remaining bankers who had the foresight and leadership to keep the bank he
served primarily local. Noel insulated his bank from the on-slaught of banking
takeovers which has made that industry just another group of national and
international businesses bent on trying to centralize the almighty dollar into
fewer and fewer hands. These international and national banks sometimes move
money around the country and world without regard for local insight and
sometimes in my opinion they have no regard for our laws, our culture or respect
for the middle class. The bank Noel served under his leadership recognized that
local people were important and always knew and could serve local interest
better than any of the national interest. Therefore he chose to keep the bank he
served locally owned and operated which was a tribute to the strength of his character.</br>
