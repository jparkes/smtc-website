<p align="center"><b>McCAIN'S
CUMBERLAND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</b>&nbsp;<b><i></br>
</br>
</i>JONES, William Duncan, 29 Jul 
1831 - 22 Jun 1909. (26th Ark. Regiment Co. G. C.S.A. alternate name W.D. Jones; 
s/o Charles Gillespie &amp; Nancy Anne Moore Jones; h/o Mary A. Comstock, married 19 
Nov 1859. Ref: Faye Bradford e-mail 15 Feb 2011.)</br>
</br>
According to Judy 
Sanders e-mail this listing appeared in (and I (WA) confirmed here) Mr. Fred 
Hawkins' book in the Mills-Black Cemetery as having a tombstone listed as such:</b><p align="center">
<b>JONES, William Duncan, 29 Jul 1831 - 
?????. (Son of Charles Gillispie &amp; Nancy Moore Jones; Arkansas Regiment, C.S.A.)</br>
</br>
</b><b>However 
this listing also appeared in the McCain's Cemetery listing again in Mr. Fred 
Hawkins' Book:</br>
</b><b></br>
</b><b>JONES, W.D. (William Duncan), 
29 Jul 1831 - 22 Jun 1909. (Son of Charles G. &amp; Nancy A. Moore Jones; Arkansas 
Regiment, C.S.A. stone broken.) </b>

Mills-Black Cemetery has not been surveyed by this researcher so I cannot say 
why he is listed in two cemeteries. Even if I had surveyed the Mills-Black 
Cemetery I still might not know which graveyard he is actually interred in. 
There were many lost graves in the Mills-Black Cemetery but the way they were 
listed by Mr. Fred, W.D. Jones appeared to have had a memorial stone. I am not 
aware of the particulars here, I do quite often see persons being buried long 
ago in old nearly abandoned cemeteries in unmarked graves and without any way to 
mark a lost grave some later member of the family adds a monument to another 
nearby more prominent cemetery maybe beside a close member of&nbsp; the 
interred's family. Did this happen here? I don't know? Jones obviously cannot be 
buried in both cemeteries.</b></br>
