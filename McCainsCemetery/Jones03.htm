Mills-Black Cemetery has not been surveyed by this researcher so I cannot say 
why he is listed in two cemeteries. Even if I had surveyed the Mills-Black 
Cemetery I still might not know which graveyard he is actually interred in. 
There were many lost graves in the Mills-Black Cemetery but the way they were 
listed by Mr. Fred, W.D. Jones appeared to have had a memorial stone. I am not 
aware of the particulars here, I do quite often see persons being buried long 
ago in old nearly abandoned cemeteries in unmarked graves and without any way to 
mark a lost grave some later member of the family adds a monument to another 
nearby more prominent cemetery maybe beside a close member of&nbsp; the 
interred's family. Did this happen here? I don't know? Jones obviously cannot be 
buried in both cemeteries.</font></b><br>
