above are two views of the historic McCains Cumberland Presbyterian Church and
Cemetery.&nbsp;<i></br>
</i>The ladies on the left are Paulene V. Barlar Thurman and her daughter Wanda
Jones. Paulene lived about all her 80+ years within a couple of miles of this
church and can tell you much if it history.&nbsp;</br>
There has been a great little history written about this church and it appeared
on the Historic Maury Site for a time. I do not know where it is now but it is
worthy reading.<i> These photos were taken from a (Barlar, Coffee &amp; Wiley)
Family History tour conducted by Wayne Austin, 5/27/2003.&nbsp; </i></b><CENTER><b>NEXT PAGE<a href="McCainview2.htm"><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/McCainsCemetery/../forwkey.jpg" </font width="68" height="22"></a></b>
