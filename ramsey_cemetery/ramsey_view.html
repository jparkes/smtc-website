&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This
is a panoramic photo of the Ramsey Cemetery. As you can see the cemetery is
cared for and quite open compared to what Fred Hawkins found in 1987. He stated
it was a thicket at that time. The Coffey family occupy the first row on your
left with the three box tombs and the Ramsey families have the rest of the
cemetery. The fancy stone in the upper right (southeast corner) of the Cemetery photo belongs
to&nbsp; that of Mary Allen. I did not find the stone of Silas Allen who was
probably Mary's husband. He died in 1845 so the stone by now may have fallen and
sunk below ground. Upper portions of this photo out of the range of cemetery
area were altered to protect private property from public view. Please do not
visit this cemetery without permission or notification of the owner of the
private property that surrounds the cemetery. <i>Graphics
