<b>RAMSEY, William, d. 4 Dec
1841. 19 years. Inscription remaining: "...Here lies the Body of William
Ramsey Who Departed this life on Dec..." <i> Photo &amp; info by
Wayne Austin 12-23-03. This stone was compared to the records of Maury County
Tennessee Cemeteries page 521 to complete the inscription as that of William's.
The above circular part actually belongs to the stone of Margaret Isabella but I
was not aware of that when this picture was taken or I would have placed it on
that memorial to get a reading.</i><p></p>
