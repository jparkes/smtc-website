<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy">Ramsey Cemetery may be found by taking Martin
Hollow Road from Campbell Station and going south 3/4 of a mile. Turn east on
the road leading to the Billy Allread Place. This is a very historic home
setting far back off of the road. Please get permission to visit this cemetery
so all will be comfortable with the purpose of your visit because you must use a
private drive to get there. The Cemetery is on the right in a cleared area back
300 yards from the house. Compared to the description Mr. Hawkins&nbsp; gave in
1987 the cemetery is well maintained but a bit barren without the cover of trees. It
is maintained and surrounded by an electric fence today. Thanks to the volunteer
who is maintaining this cemetery. If you have
relatives here you should consider making a contribution to the upkeep. The
(private) home &amp; cemetery has a very historic place in Campbell Station
History. Originally it belonged to the Ramsey &amp; Clark families but you may
read about that in the other histories.</span></h1>
