(Miller Lake Rd.), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

This is a map to show you the GPS coordinates of the Hubbell Cemetery marked by 
the red check as 35.45845 X 
-87.110372.&nbsp;</br>

In Southport on Hwy 245 take 
Bethel Church Rd aka Miller Lake Rd west/south about 1 mile. Miller Lake is on 
your right. With permission find the cemetery just up from the bank of the lake 
into the woods. It is near the lake in a beautiful location with the lake just 
200-300 feet away. I parked in the sharp bend (to the left) on Miller Lake Road, 
then climbed beside the dam of the lake back to the north side of the lake. The 
walk was about 400 feet (or 133 yards.)</br>

This is the clearest map of the 
Lake Area shown here as Badger Spring Lake, but probably known at one time as 
Miller Lake. We can see the red check marking about where the cemetery will be 
found back into the woods and up the slope some.</br>
