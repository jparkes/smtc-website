<p><b><tt><u>Salty Dawg - 
2013</u>:<br/>
On this Lord's day November 12, 2013, I was fortunate to visit the Hubbell 
graves on Miller Lake Road. The owner of the lake was very kind to allow me leeway to the graves and neighbors helped me locate them. At first I searched 
for them using Google maps online, but the location was wrong. Here are the 
exact GPS coordinates of the cemetery: 35.45845, -87.110372 <br/>
<br/>
There are only two graves:  George Washington Hubbell and Elizabeth Adaline 
Hubbell. I didn't have paper to copy the names... going by memory.<br/>
<br/>
The graves were not hard to find, just off the bank of the lake in the woods. 
You can tell that the cemetery has been peacefully left alone. There's no sign 
of a fence or wall, and also no sign of visitors for many years. I was impressed 
to find the graves still standing with fairly readable inscriptions. Both graves 
have foot stones with their initials: G. W. H. and E. A. H.<br/>
<br/>
The cemetery is in a beautiful location with the lake just 200-300 feet away.  
I parked in the sharp bend on Miller Lake Road, then climbed beside the dam of 
the lake. The walk was only about 400 feet.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I visit (very soon), I will take a camera and paper to copy / 
photograph the inscriptions. (done &amp; shown above)<br/>
