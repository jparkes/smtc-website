CEMETERY,&nbsp;Natchez Trace

</p>

<p><b>GRIGG, Winnie F. Cartwright, died Aug 1926.
(We are told actually the name is Winnie Francis (Griggs) Carter.)</br>
</br>
From David Mc via e-mail to Mary Bob McClain 10 May 2010:</br>
</b></p>
<p><b>Mary Bob,</br>
Although the headstone reads Cartwright, this is actually Winnie Francis Carter
(Griggs). My Great-grandmother, Lavina Jane Harris (Griggs) was in her dottage
when she had her mother's stone made and had been watching a lot of Bonanza at
the time so when asked to give the name particulars for the tombstone she got
the names mixed up with the Cartwright clan name.</b></p>
<p><b>Also I'm not sure why, but all of the
Griggs' family tombstones seem to leave off the &quot;s&quot; even though all
the official records I can find (birth/death/marriage certs, etc) have it
included.</br>
