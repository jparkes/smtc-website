Although the headstone reads Cartwright, this is actually Winnie Francis Carter
(Griggs). My Great-grandmother, Lavina Jane Harris (Griggs) was in her dottage
when she had her mother's stone made and had been watching a lot of Bonanza at
the time so when asked to give the name particulars for the tombstone she got
the names mixed up with the Cartwright clan name.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#BB2206" size="2"><b>Also I'm not sure why, but all of the
Griggs' family tombstones seem to leave off the &quot;s&quot; even though all
the official records I can find (birth/death/marriage certs, etc) have it
included.<br>
