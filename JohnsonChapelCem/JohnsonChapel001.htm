<p><b>Feb. 20, 1935 - Joe Harris, First district
tenant farmer, in jail on a charge of murder in the first degree growing out of
the death at 5 o'clock yesterday of Odie Hay, 23, a neighbor, was scheduled to
be arraigned before Squire M.S. King today to be bound over to the grand jury,
which is now in session.</b></p>
<p><b>Tom Humphreys, owner of the land on which
Harris lives, has indicated he would go on his bond.</b></p>
<p><b>Harris, found at his home near Fly's Store
yesterday afternoon several hours after the shooting which occurred on his land
about 10:39 o'clock yesterday morning, was calmly helping his wife in mounting a
quilting frame.</b></p>
<p><b>He handed the officers the pistol used in
the shooting, a .32 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, which had been shot three
times, and which he told officers was just as it was when the shooting ended.
Constables Austin Harlan and Gerald Holcomb were the arresting officers.</b></p>
<p><b>Harris did not deny the shooting, but was
reticent except to indicate that he was not the aggressor and that Hay was
advancing toward him at the time, meanwhile upbraiding him. As far as officers
know, Hay was unarmed.</b></p>
