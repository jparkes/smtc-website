Go out Santa Fe Pike and enter Leon Walters farm (1987) south of Pike. Go by

This photo points out the place the Hughes Cemetery should be found in the distant
hills. We are shooting from the Timmons Cemetery across Santa Fe Pike. It is
something less than half way to the Duck River from the Santa Fe Pike.</br>
