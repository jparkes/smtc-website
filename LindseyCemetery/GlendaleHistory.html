<p align="center"><u>Glendale, A History</u>

</p>


<p>
Early in this century a number of communities thrived and contained almost
everything that was necessary for the existence of its inhabitance. Glendale
called then Hurricane was
one of the most substantial of these. It came into existence in 1866 in a major
way when the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad located a Rail Switch and small station at this point, calling the
station, &quot;Hurricane Switch.&quot; This tended to alter the name from
Hurricane to Hurricane Switch for the community as a whole. Within a couple of years the Thomas family opened
a general store and other business enterprises followed. In 1868 a Methodist
church was organized and the first church building erected. Hurricane became
quite famous for its religious fervor throughout the region as early as 1870 when an annual
camp-meeting
was begun. People from as far away as Nashville and Pulaski crowded into the
tents and brush arbors, often numbering in the thousands. September was the
month designated for this activity and it continued until at least 1883. Like
most villages, Glendale/(Hurricane Switch) lost its attractions when highways were built, cars
became numerous and the railroad downgraded its services. It continues as
Glendale, however,
with its churches, a small convenience store (1980s) and a few other business
activities. The center of Glendale today (2009) is at the point where the Culleoka Road
(Hwy 373) &amp; new Lewisburg Pike (Hwy 50) intersect, but encompasses the
larger residential and commercial area. The name Hurricane/(Hurricane Switch),
no longer heard, fades into history.

<u>Glendale, a 1906 perspective</u>

</p>


<p>Glendale is on the L. &amp; N., six m. south
of Columbia, It was formerly called Hurricane Switch, and lost that designation
with the invention of the Automobile &amp; decline of the Rails in that area.
Benjamin Thomas was one of the pioneers to Maury Cu., and its first treasurer.
His son, Alfred, lived near Glendale; and B. S., son of the latter, was born
here, Jan., 1846, and opened a store here in 1870. A few years later he erected
the handsome home, where his son, Hardin W., resides. He married Hattie C.
Mayberry, and from this union came H. W., Robert Smith, Alfred L., and Katie
Lee, wife of D. A. Oliver, of Groveland (about 2 miles n. of here). Mr. Thomas
died, Oct. 2, 1903, and the store was continued by his sons, H. W., A. L., and R
S., as Thomas Bros. The Glendale Mercantile Co., started, 1901, was purchased by
Thomas Bros., 1903, and, having lost their store by fire, March, 1905, they at
once added a new stock to the Glendale Mercantile Company building, and have
continued as a good store.</br>
</br>
The Thomas Brothers have a 200-acre farm, and keep a good line of blooded stock
that has made some notable records on the turf. Van Buren Wilkes and Pearl A.
are especially worthy of mention. Hardin W. Thomas. whose efficient services as
secretary of the building committee of the new Columbia Herald, is favorably
known to those who visit the County Clerk's office, where his courteous services
have won many friends and made him a popular candidate for that office next
year. He married Daisy, daughter of J. C. McClendon; while his brother, Alfred
L., married Virginia, daughter of A. F. and Virginia (Morgan) Brown.</br>
</br>
The Glendale Post Office was kept by B. S. Thomas until his death, when Alfred
L. was appointed, and Hardin W. succeeded, Sept. 1, 1905.</br>
A Blacksmith and Repair Shop was found conducted by D. S. Hancock, who was born,
Dec. 5, 1867, at Bellbuckle, Tn. and has been in this business since 1901. He is
son of J. L. and Sarah (Lowe) Hancock, and married Nell, daughter of T. J. and
Mary (Booker) Douglas. This shop was owned by Benjamin S. Thomas and managed by
B. F. Haywood for 17 years prior to the purchase by D. S. Hancock, who does good
work and holds a large trade.</br>
Dr. J. S. Covey, son of W. R. and Martha Lou (Craig) Covey, of Culleoka, was
born Oct., 1868, attended the Webb Bros and Wall &amp; Mooney Academy,
graduating from Vanderbilt University, 1892, since which he has been in practice
at Culleoka and Glendale, which are but four miles distant. August, 1903, he
married the widow of W. W. Cochran, who was Willie, daughter of M. B. and
Mildred (Dillard) Tomlinson, of Culleoka. Her daughter, Virginia Cochran, is a
student at the Glendale School.</p>
