 A red check is placed on the Worley or Whiteside Cemetery. Other cemeteries that are on this map are the
Jones Presbyterian Church Cemetery 300 yards east of here; the Kittrell
Family Cemetery 350 yards east and north of the Jones Presbyterian Church
Cemetery. At the top of the map is the Kittrell
Cemetery aka Catheys Creek Church of Christ Cemetery. Catheys Creek Church
of Christ can be seen just south of and on the other side of the road from the
Kittrell Cemetery. <br/>

From Columbia traveling Hampshire Pike go about 10 miles and veer right off of Hampshire Pike onto Taylor Store
Road. After
3/4 mile turn left on
Catheys Creek Road. When that road bends sharply right (or north) then turn left
into the Worley &amp; Jones Cemetery Gravel Roads. <i>This happens to be the old
community of Isom.</i>  Next follow the right fork of the road (marked Worley Cemetery) up the hill toward the
cemetery at the end of the road.  <i><br/>
