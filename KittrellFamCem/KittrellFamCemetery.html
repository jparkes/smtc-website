<center>KITTRELL FAMILY
CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
Directions 29 Oct 1987: In Isom, on south side of Cathey's Creek, between barn
&amp; barn on Hyle Cathey place. <br/>
Directions 28 Oct 2008: Veer off of Hampshire Pike onto Taylor Store Rd. and after
3/4 mile turn left on Catheys Creek Road. When that road bends sharply right or
north then turn left into the Worley &amp; Jones Cemetery Gravel Roads. 
This happens to be the old community of Isom. Follow the left fork of the road (marked Jones Cemetery Rd) up the hill toward
the farm house. The cemetery is on your right on the same hill as the sprawling
Jones Presbyterian Church Cemetery.  There are two barns there and the
cemetery and rock wall are just (or the other side) south of the 2nd barn between the barn and the
Jones Presbyterian Church Cemetery.     <a href="KittrellCemeteryMaps.html">Maps

<p>This small cemetery is enclosed in a high rock wall
with no entrance. It is badly grown-up in bushes and weeds with the trees
threatening the wall and the memorials. Mr. Fred said this in 1987 and it is even
more true today 28 Oct 2008, 21 years to the day later. The wall next to the barn
is
collapsing under the lower part and will soon completely fall on that side
leaving a place 10 feet wide without a fence. <br/>
