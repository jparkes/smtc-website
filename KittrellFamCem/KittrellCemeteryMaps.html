&nbsp;A red check is placed on the Kittrell Family Cemetery sometimes called Catheys
Creek Church of Christ Cemetery. Other cemeteries that are on this map are the Worley Cemetery
otherwise known as the Whiteside Cemetery; the Jones Presbyterian Church
Cemetery and at the top of the map the Kittrell Cemetery. Catheys Creek Church
of Christ can be seen just south of and on the other side of the road from the
Kittrell Cemetery.&nbsp;</br>

Veer off of Hampshire Pike onto Taylor Store Rd. and after 3/4 mile turn left on
Catheys Creek Road. When that road bends sharply right or north then turn left
into the Worley &amp; Jones Cemetery Gravel Roads. <i>This happens to be the old
community of Isom.</i> Follow the left fork of the road (marked Jones Cemetery
Rd) up the hill toward the farm house (private property). The cemetery is on
your right on the same hill as the sprawling Jones Presbyterian Church Cemetery.
There are two barns there and the cemetery and rock wall are just south (or the
other side) of the 2nd barn (or small shed) between the barn and the Jones Presbyterian Church
Cemetery.</b><i><b></br>
