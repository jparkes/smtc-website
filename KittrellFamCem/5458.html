This photo was made pointing the camera directly in the direction of the Jones
Presbyterian Church Cemetery beginning about 80 yards further up the hill in the
trees. There are several fences here indicating a change in ownership of
properties and also keeping cattle out of the cemetery areas. Something these
owners should be commended for.<br/>
