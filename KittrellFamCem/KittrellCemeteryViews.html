Â A view looking north at the high rock wall of the Kittrell Family Cemetery
it is not as visible as we would like because of the weeds. Notice the many
trees here are in various stages of growth and decay. All that ebb and flow of
the flora is slowly destroying this cemetery. From inside the wall one cannot make a view
photo of this cemetery because all that could be seen in the photo is brush &amp; thickets.

<b>People need to understand
that these trees and plant growth are feeding off the bodies of their ancestors.
That is partly why it so brushy and thick inside the wall of the cemetery. Don't
ask me to go into detail as to how that happens. You don't want to know and I
don't want to tell you.<br/>
