<b>KOONCE, Mary Elizabeth, 5 Apr 1819 - 12 Jan 1837. &quot;Consort of J. H. Koonce.&quot;<br>
It is not fashionable to pick on prior researchers errors, but they (use no
names) called the death date here as 1857 when it is in fact 1837. That is the
difference in the numeral three and five. These two numerals are the same except
for the five has a faint cross bar connecting the lower part to the upper cross
bar vertically as shown here:<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/KittrellFamCem/5-1.jpg" width="49" height="60"> whereas the three
has a faint bar traversing diagonally from the upper part of the character to
the back side of the upper cross bar as shown:<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/KittrellFamCem/3-1.jpg" width="48" height="60">.
That can be very subtle in a quick reading of the stone can be missed. Another
clue? This is not normally an 1857 era stone as those tended to be in styles.<br>
