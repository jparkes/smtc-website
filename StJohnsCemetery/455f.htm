</b><font color="#800000"><br>
<b>Edwin Wilkinson &quot;Wick&quot; Halliday died at home on Sunday, July 20, 2014, after 
an extended illness. He was born in Memphis on June 6, 1932, predeceased by his 
father, William Parker Halliday, mother Caroline Wilkinson Halliday, brother 
William Parker Halliday, Jr., and sister in law Dorothy Allen Halliday. He is 
survived by his wife of fifty-seven years, Polly Ann Trabue Halliday, son Edwin 
Wilkinson Halliday, Jr. (Sandy) of Columbia, two grandchildren Edwin Wilkinson 
Halliday, III (Wilks) and Currey Pillow Halliday, his brother in law Thomas M. 
Trabue, Jr. (Evelyn) of Nashville and several nieces and nephews. Wick was 
raised in Memphis, but spent much time in Maury County as a young man with his 
family, the Ridleys and the Jewells. He graduated from Columbia Military Academy 
in 1951 and attended The University of Tennessee where he played football for 
Coach Robert Neyland. From 1954-1956 he served in the United States Army in 1st 
Infantry Division, also known as the Big Red One. After his time in the service 
he came back to Columbia and managed his family's farm on the Campbellsville 
Pike raising cattle, corn, soybeans, tobacco and curing country hams, for which 
he was well known. He was truly a man of the soil who believed that land was a 
gift from God that was to be taken care of and improved during one's lifetime 
and left to future generations. He strived to set that example during his life 
and was voted Tennessee Young Farmer of the year by the Tennessee State Farm 
Bureau in 1969. He and his son Win were named Century Farmers in Maury County in 
2002, honoring family farms that had been in continuous operation for over one 
hundred years. He was a lifelong Episcopalian and served as Junior Warden of the 
Vestry at St. Peter's Church several times. Wick served for sixteen years as 
Chairman of the Board of St. John's Cemetery and oversaw the renovation of the 
interior and exterior of the church building. He also served on the Board of 
Directors of First Farmers and Merchants Bank for many years and at the time of 
his death was a member of their honorary board. He was a board member and past 
chairman at Columbia Military Academy, predecessor of the present day Columbia 
Academy, and a past Maury County Commissioner. The family wishes to thank the 
loyal and devoted care givers Wanda Morris and her family. A visitation will be 
held in the Parish Hall at St. Peter's Episcopal Church on Tuesday, July 22, 
2014 from 4:00 until 6:00 P.M. with a graveside service on Wednesday, July 23, 
2014 at 2:00 P.M. at St. John's Cemetery. The Reverend Thomas Wilson will 
officiate. Memorials may be made to Zion Christian Academy 6901 Old Zion Road, 
Columbia, TN 38401 or St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 311 West Seventh Street also 
in Columbia. Oakes &amp; Nichols Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.<br>
