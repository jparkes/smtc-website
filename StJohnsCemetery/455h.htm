</br>
<b>HART, Charlotte Lewis Age 63, died peacefully on July 19th. </br>
She was preceded in death by her father, Frederick Donald Hart.</br>
Charlotte was an inspiration to many with her smile and unrestrained joy for the 
simplest things in life. Even with her disabilities, she was exuberant about 
everything she did, and for all the people she met, including many, loving 
caregivers.</br>
The fellowship with her church was an important part of her life, and through 
the support of Progress, Inc. and her family, she enjoyed involvement in various 
community activities. </br>
