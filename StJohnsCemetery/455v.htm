</font><font color="#800000"  size="2">Tom C. Sharp, Jr., 
90, Executive Director Emeritus of the Tennessee Pharmacists Association, the 
voice of pharmacy in Tennessee for more than four decades, died Monday, December 
23, 2013 at Nashville Alive Hospice.<br>
Burial in St. John's Churchyard, Ashwood with military honors provided by 
Herbert Griffin American Legion Post 19. <br>
The Nashville native was the son of the late Tom Clayton Sharp, Sr. and Sina 
Russell Sharp. He and his brother Charles Russell Sharp, who both became 
pharmacists, grew up working with their father at Sharp's Drugstore in East 
Nashville. Dr. Sharp would later succeed his father, Tom C. Sharp, Sr., as 
leader of the Tennessee Pharmacists Association.<br>
Dr. Sharp, an Isaac Litton High School graduate, interrupted his collegiate 
career at Tennessee Technological University to enlist in the U. S. Army during 
World War II, where he served in a Signal Battalion stationed in New Guinea.<br>
At the end of the war, he completed his pharmacy degree at the University of 
Tennessee College of Pharmacy in Memphis and returned to Nashville to practice 
pharmacy. Dr. Sharp served for several years as Chief Pharmacist at the 
Tennessee Tuberculosis Hospital. <br>
During his three-decade tenure with TPA, from 1964 to 1994, he served as mentor 
to countless students and recently-graduated pharmacists. He was the recipient 
of several professional honors, including the highest honor bestowed upon a 
pharmacist, the Bowl of Hygeia Award in 1994. Dr. Sharp was most appreciative of 
the &quot;Tom C. Sharp Pharmacist of the Year&quot; plaque presented to him in 2000, 
originally named in honor of his father. <br>
After his retirement, he concentrated on collecting and organizing the 
historical documents and photos he had amassed over his career, and wrote the 
book The History of the Tennessee Pharmacists Association.<br>
In the course of his career, his influence went beyond pharmacy and beyond the 
borders of Tennessee. He served as President of the National Association of 
Pharmacy Association Executives in 1978 and 1979 and as President of the 
Tennessee Society of Association Executives in 1970.<br>
He was also a founding member of St. James the Less Episcopal Church in Madison, 
TN where he served in many capacities.<br>
