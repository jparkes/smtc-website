DUBOSE, Pvt. Joel, (26 Mar, 1845) - d. 29 Nov 1864. "Wounded in Battle of 
Columbia, Tenn." (Eufaula (Barbour Co. Al. native; William Joel DuBose, s/o 
Hezekiah and Mary Elizabeth Hawkins BuBose; C.S.A.; Ref: e-mail from Anita 
Newsom Nail, Greenville, Ms. nail@tecinfo.com)<br/>
<br/>
  This is the information I (Anita) 
have for Joel DuBose, which came from family letters, notes and personal family 
knowledge.  </b> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><b>
Joel was the son of my great grandmother�s sister, who (she) died 
the day after he was born.  Two months later, his father married my great 
grandmother, Amanda Evalinah Hawkins.  They lived in Aquilla (Choctaw) AL for a 
time. To escape approaching Union forces they fled to Denham (Wayne) MS, to live 
in what is now the oldest house in the county.  Joel was his grandfather�s 
namesake, and his half brother, Horace Mellard DuBose, became a Methodist 
Bishop.  The DuBoses' were descendants of Huguenots who came to Charlestown, SC 
from Normandy, by way of London, England.<o:p>  </o:p>

William �Joel� DuBose, son of Hezekiah and Mary Elizabeth 
(Hawkins) DuBose, was born March 26, 1845 in Eufaula (Barbour) AL.  He received 
a head wound on November 28, 1864 during the Battle of Lookout Mountain.  He 
died December 10, 1864 and is buried on the bank of the North Fork of the Duck 
River in Tennessee.  [I don�t know about this part�were soldiers reinterred in 
other resting places?  Is the Duck River in Maury Co TN?] </b>

<p align="center"><b>Comment by C. Wayne Austin - his burial 
place on the North Fork of the Duck River is intriguing. It probably does not 
tell us anything since the Duck River is a long winding river spanning across 
Middle Tennessee from above Coffee County Tennessee to eventually empty into the 
Tennessee River in Benton county Tennessee. The North Fork might refer to a 
location in Coffee County where the river originates and has a fork to the north 
and another branching to the southeast. This is not close to where the battle of 
Lookout Mountain took place which was fought in the Mountains above Chattanooga. 
However the listings are confusing above in that one said Battle of Columbia and 
another text said Battle of Lookout Mountain which is east Tennessee in 
Chattanooga. I think there is some misguided text here somewhere. Joel may have 
been a patient in a hospital near that North Fork River location and they buried 
the dead soldiers nearby when they did not survive. However, he at least has a 
memorial stone or his remains may have been moved to the St Johns Cemetery in 
Maury County several miles south of the Duck River and between Mt Pleasant and 
Columbia,Tn. This is about half way down the Duck River toward its final 
emptying place and some ninety miles west of the Lookout Mountain. </b>
