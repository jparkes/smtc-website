</span>Mary Edwin Walker Ryan, 13 Jul 1914 - 9 Jan 1998.<span style="color: navy"><i><br>
She was a prominent Secretarial official of the Monsanto Chemical a Phosphate 
Mining/Refining Company in Mt Pleasant at one time. Monsanto was the biggest and 
one of the last three that produced Phosphate in the County.<br>
<br>
This industry finally left Maury County due to increased operational costs, a 
decline in the market for phosphate materials (primarily in the manufacture of 
detergents), and the depletion of phosphate reserves, factors that ended the 
phosphate industry in this area. Mobil Chemical Company, which had purchased the 
Virginia-Carolina plant in Mt. Pleasant, shut down its phosphorus furnace in 
1971. Monsanto Chemical Company began its shut down in 1986. Rhone-Poulenc, 
owner of the former Stauffer Company, and Occidental Chemical Corporation ceased 
operations in 1991.<br>
