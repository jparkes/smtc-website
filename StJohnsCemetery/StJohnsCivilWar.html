tut, Johnny; all that sounds tolerable nice, but then you might want some favor
from Uncle Sam, and the teat is too full of milk at the present time for us to
turn loose. It's a sugar teat, Johnny, and just begins to taste sweet; and,
besides, Johnny, once or twice you have put us to a little trouble; we haven't
forgot that; and we've got you down now--our foot is on your neck, and you must
feel our boot heel. We want to stamp you a little--"that's what's the
matter with Hannah." And, Johnny, you've fought us hard. You are a brave
boy; you are proud and aristocratic, Johnny, and we are going to crush your
cursed pride and spirit. And now, Johnny, come here; I've something to whisper
in your ear. Hold your ear close down here, so that no one can hear: "We
want big fat offices when the war is over. Some of us want to be presidents,
some governors, some go to congress, and be big ministers to 'Urup,' and all
those kind of things, Johnny, you know. Just go back to your camp, Johnny, chase
round, put on a bold front, flourish your trumpets, blow your horns. And,
Johnny, we don't want to be hard on you, and we'll tell you what we'll do for
you. Away back in your territory, between Columbia and Nashville, is the most
beautiful country, and the most fertile, and we have lots of rations up there,
too. Now, you just go up there, Johnny, and stay until we want you. We ain't
done with you yet, my boy--O, no, Johnny. And, another thing, Johnny; you will
find there between Mt. Pleasant and Columbia, the most beautiful country that
the sun of heaven ever shone upon; and half way between the two places is St.
John's Church. Its tower is all covered over with a beautiful vine of ivy; and,
Johnny, you know that in olden times it was the custom to entwine a wreath of
ivy around the brows of victorious generals. We have no doubt that many of your
brave generals will express a wish, when they pass by, to be buried beneath the
ivy vine that shades so gracefully and beautifully the wall of this grand old
church. And, Johnny, you will find a land of beauty and plenty, and when you get
there, just put on as much style as you like; just pretend, for our sake, you
know, that you are a bully boy with a glass eye, and that you are the victorious
army that has returned to free an oppressed people. We will allow you this,
Johnny, so that we will be the greater when we want you, Johnny. And now,
Johnny, we did not want to tell you what we are going to say to you now, but
will, so that you'll feel bad. Sherman wants to 'march to the sea, while the
world looks on and wonders.' He wants to desolate the land and burn up your
towns, to show what a coward he is, and how dastardly, and one of our boys wants
to write a piece of poetry about it. But that ain't all, Johnny. You know that
you fellows have got a great deal of cotton at Augusta, Savannah, Charleston,
Mobile, and other places, and cotton is worth two dollars a pound in gold, and
as Christmas is coming, we want to go down there for some of that cotton to make
a Christmas gift to old Abe and old Clo, don't you see? O, no, Johnny, we don't
want to end the war just yet awhile. The sugar is mighty sweet in the teat, and
we want to suck a while longer. Why, sir, we want to rob and then burn every
house in Georgia and South Carolina. We will get millions of dollars by robbery
alone, don't you see?"113<br style="mso-special-character:

OF GENERAL LEONIDAS POLK <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">General
Leonidas Polk, our old leader, whom we had followed all through that long war,
had gone forward with some of his staff to the top of Pine Mountain, to
reconnoiter, as far as was practicable, the position of the enemy in our front.
While looking at them with his field glass, a solid shot from the Federal guns
struck him on his left breast, passing through his body and through his heart. I
saw him while the infirmary corps were bringing him off the field. He was as
white as a piece of marble, and a most remarkable thing about him was, that not
a drop of blood was ever seen to come out of the place through which the cannon
ball had passed. My pen and ability is inadequate to the task of doing his
memory justice. Every private soldier loved him. Second to Stonewall Jackson,
his loss was the greatest the South ever sustained. When I saw him there dead, I
felt that I had lost a friend whom I had ever loved and respected, and that the
South had lost one of her best and greatest generals. His soldiers always loved
and honored him. They called him "Bishop Polk." "Bishop
Polk" was ever a favorite with the army, and when any position was to be
held, and it was known that "Bishop Polk" was there, we knew and felt
that "all was well." GOLGOTHA CHURCH--GENERAL LUCIUS E. POLK WOUNDED
On this Kennesaw line, near Golgotha Church, one evening about 4 o'clock, our
Confederate line of battle and the Yankee line came in close proximity. If I
mistake not, it was a dark, drizzly, rainy evening. The cannon balls were
ripping and tearing through the bushes. The two lines were in plain view of each
other. General Pat Cleburne was at this time commanding Hardee's corps, and
General Lucius E. Polk was in command of Cleburne's division. General John C.
Brown's division was supporting Cleburne's division, or, rather, "in
echelon." Every few moments, a raking fire from the Yankee lines would be
poured into our lines, tearing limbs off the trees, and throwing rocks and dirt
in every direction; but I never saw a soldier quail, or even dodge. We had
confidence in old Joe, and were ready to march right into the midst of battle at
a moment's notice. While in this position, a bomb, loaded with shrapnel and
grapeshot, came ripping and tearing through our ranks, wounding General Lucius
E. Polk, and killing some of his staff. And, right here, I deem it not
inappropriate to make a few remarks as to the character and appearance of so
brave and gallant an officer. At this time he was about twenty-five years old,
with long black hair, that curled, a gentle and attractive black eye that seemed
to sparkle with love rather than chivalry, and were it not for a young moustache
and goatee that he usually wore, he would have passed for a beautiful girl. In
his manner he was as simple and guileless as a child, and generous almost to a
fault. Enlisting in the First Arkansas Regiment as a private soldier, and
serving for twelve months as orderly sergeant; at the reorganization he was
elected colonel of the regiment, and afterwards, on account of merit and
ability, was commissioned brigadier-general; distinguishing himself for
conspicuous bravery and gallantry on every battlefield, and being
"scalped" by a minnie ball at Richmond, Kentucky-- which scar marks
its furrow on top of his head today. In every battle he was engaged in, he led
his men to victory, or held the enemy at bay, while the surge of battle seemed
against us; he always seemed the successful general, who would snatch victory
out of the very jaws of defeat. In every battle, Polk's brigade, of Cleburne's
division, distinguished itself, almost making the name of Cleburne as the
Stonewall of the West. Polk was to Cleburne what Murat or the old guard was to
Napoleon. And, at the battle of Chickamauga, when it seemed that the Southern
army had nearly lost the battle, General Lucius E. Polk's brigade made the most
gallant charge of the war, turning the tide of affairs, and routing the Yankee
army. General Polk himself led the charge in person, and was the first man on
top of the Yankee breastworks (_vide_ General D. H. Hill's report of the battle
of Chickamauga), and in every attack he had the advance guard, and in every
retreat, the rear guard of the army. Why? Because General Lucius E. Polk and his
brave soldiers _never_ faltered, and with him as leader, the general commanding
the army knew that "all was well." <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Well,
this evening of which I now write, the litter corps ran up and placed him on a
litter, and were bringing him back through Company H, of our regiment, when one
of the men was wounded, and I am not sure but another one was killed, and they
let him fall to the ground. At that time, the Yankees seemed to know that they
had killed or wounded a general, and tore loose their batteries upon this point.
The dirt and rocks were flying in every direction, when Captain Joe P. Lee, Jim
Brandon and myself, ran forward, grabbed up the litter, brought General Polk off
the crest of the hill, and assisted in carrying him to the headquarters of
General Cleburne. When we got to General Cleburne, he came forward and asked
General Polk if he was badly wounded, and General Polk remarked, laughingly:
"Well, I think I will be able to get a furlough now." This is a fact.
General Polk's leg had been shot almost entirely off. I remember the foot part
being twisted clear around, and lying by his side, while the blood was running
through the litter in a perfect stream. I remember, also, that General Cleburne
dashed a tear from his eye with his hand, and saying, "Poor fellow,"
at once galloped to the front, and ordered an immediate advance of our lines.
Cleburne's division was soon engaged. Night coming on, prevented a general
engagement, but we drove the Yankee line two miles. <o:p>
