  <b>SWAN, Sarah J. Spencer,
  10 Dec 1838 - 10 Jun 1908. Mother, "Wife of John N. Swan". </b><b>If
  John N. Stone is the husband of Sarah the memorial for
  John N. Stone is high upon the hill
  above the main cemetery area.</b><b>
  Believe the lower main section of the cemetery was established later and since John
  N. died early in the history of the cemetery then he was buried in the older
  section upon the hill.<i>
