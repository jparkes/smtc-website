  <b>CLARK, H. L., 12 Aug
  1896 - 17 Nov 1925 MasonÂ <br/>
  and<br/>
  CLARK, Lillian Gipson, 14 Jun 1901 - (21 May 1971). Sometimes no death dates
  indicated the first spouse died young and the widow remarried and is buried
  beside her second spouse. Other times it indicated she lived long (as it does
  here) after her
  husband and had no one overseeing the inscription. I do not know what happened here.
  This stone is farther up the hill in the older section.<i><br/>
