This image shows you one reason why trees should not be allowed to grow in a
cemetery. Here a tree has grown up in the soft soils of a tree where of course
the soil has been made softer by digging a grave years ago. The headstone is
fallen on the left and the top of the foot stone is protruding above the soil
line on the right side of the tree. We are back in the forest where the earlier
graves for the Ebenezer Cemetery are located.</b></p>
