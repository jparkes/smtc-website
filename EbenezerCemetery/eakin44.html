  EAKIN, Margaret Gale, 25 Jul 1935 - (death or birth date missing). Not certain if this is
  small sibling children or a husband wife without birth dates. The stones
  appear to be the style and aging as if it has been there since the 1930s and
  they don't appear to be for small children. My best guess is that this is for
  a husband and wife with no birth dates or perhaps no death dates shown.<i>&nbsp; Information by Wayne Austin
