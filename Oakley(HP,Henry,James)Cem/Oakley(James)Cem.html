<p>Located here is one massive monument with nine footstones marking 
the
graves.&nbsp; Mr. Humphrey said that just a few years ago
some Oakley descendents came from California and sponsored
a ceremony and the D. A. R. plaque then was erected. Visited 1986 by Mr. Vester Humphrey &amp;
Fred L. Hawkins.&nbsp;1986</br>
</br>
Recently visited by Gloria Smith with a good report of conditions stating as: The last time
I was there, about two summers ago, there was a wire fence encircling the graves
and chickens were roaming everywhere and scratching! There was no grass, just
dirt. Cousins of mine that visited there reported that the chickens are gone and grass is now growing
and that the cemetery looks much better. [Gloria Smith, Booneville MS., 3 Jun
