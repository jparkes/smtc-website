The above cemetery with the red check is shown on this map as the Johnson-Oakley Cemetery. I believe
the position on the map for the GPS coordinates are generally correct, but have
not been there yet.<br>

<b>On Vester Humphrey farm in Fly. Turn onto small lane at garage in Fly and go
about 1/4 mile north. The cemetery is on hill behind house. Notice the blue
arrow pointing out the cemetery using the GPS coordinates. I do not know if this
is right but have no reason to disbelieve it as of now. There have been major
road changes since then and I am unaware if that has impacted the location of
this cemetery.<br>

This just one other place I will look for this cemetery in this area if I do not find
anyone who knows where it is. Maps above show it very close to Leipers Creek Rd.
(about 40 yards)<br>
