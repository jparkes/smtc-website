</b><b>Unreadable stone. There is
lettering there.&nbsp; It is not clear. The photo was slightly blurred and the
lettering is probably hand inscribed on this fieldstone.</br>
</b><b><i>This record based on a visit and photos made by Charlotte Colvett, 6 Jun 2008.
Her visit was in the early part of May 2008.</i></b><b></br>
