<b>According to the GS topographical map shown
above the cemetery is just inside Maury County.<br/>
Go to Summertown in Lawrence County and
follow Holloway road north into Lewis County and back into Maury County for about three miles.
The road crosses the old railroad bed and then turns east for a short distance
then back north before meandering back eastward. It can be found in the woods
shown below to the right of Holloway St near a home as pointed out (by the one
legged yellow arrow) on the aerial map above.</b></p>
