</font><font size="2" color="#008000">The James Holland family settled on the south side of the Duck River 
between Rieves Bend (north side) and Whithworth Bend (north side) but on the 
south side of the Duck river. The family lived near the Holland Ford at the mouth of Negro Creek where there were shallow rapids&nbsp;to allow crossing 
of the river. This was also near the Stillhouse Hole upriver, which was 
at one time a swirling mass of water that seemed not to flow forward. There is a 
fine spring above Stillhouse Hole that afforded plenty of water.</font><font color="#CC3300" size="2">&nbsp;

During April 1863 of the Civil War, the Yanks took the life of a Confederate 
Soldier close by. His name was Albert Childrey. It happened while Childrey was 
home on leave at his home. After being notified of Childrey's presence in the 
area the Yanks stationed at nearby Hurricane Switch (Glendale) pursued him. He 
escaped and fled north toward the Duck River. He plunged into the rain-swollen 
waters of the river and attempted to escape by crossing to the other side. The 
soldiers caught up with him and shot him from the bluffs overlooking the Duck 
river as he was swimming across. Albert was buried in the Hill Cemetery near his 
home, at Hill Station. His grave is today considered lost and is unmarked. See 
Hill Cemetery.<br>
