HOLLAND-WATSON CEMETERY,&nbsp;Stillhouse Hole Duck River Bluff, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</b><b>Also known as Holland Cemetery or aka 
Watson Cemetery.</br>

I hve plotted my best guess of where this cemetery can be found as near 
Stillhouse hole but concede the place may be nearer the Place as marked on the 
map. While my plotting is N 35.56352 X W -86.93693 the plotting for the USGS 
mapping is further north as also noted on this map as Holland Cemetery 
Green/white Symbol. I moved my plotting south based on this set of directions by 
Fred Hawkins:
&quot;From Groveland take 
Hill Station Rd. to Dixon Rd.; turn left and go 1/4 mile. Turn right on a Jeep 
trail and go a mile in the direction of Duck River. The cemetery is very close 
to the place where the T.V.A. transmission line crosses this trail. It is in the 
edge of the woods, on top of a bluff, overlooking Stillhouse Hole in the Duck 
River.&quot;
According to old Topo 
maps Stillhouse hole was southeast of this place about where I have my plotting 
overlooking the bluff of the river. I am sure all this area is grown up and no 
longer has open fields except the few shown above.</br>

<b>This Topography map shows some of the 
historical places mentioned. Most of the plotting are from 1940s or older. I 
have placed a yellow check pointing to where on this map I now think this cemetery 
might best be found. This is nearer the USGS plotting than my other plotting 
which is on the bluff directly over Stillhouse Hole. This assumes that the ridge 
above the Duck river in Mr Hawkins mind was not actually next to the Duck River, 
but back aways. Cemeteries were almost always set in the highest areas around.&nbsp; 
The wide place in the river is the Stillhouse hole labeled 
as such to the right of the spot in the river. My decision here is based on the 
edge of the trees at the junction of the TVA transmission lines and the jeep 
trail meets as marked on the trail spanning east/west. So now we hve three 
places to look to find this cemetery. Best to have a guide that knows where it 
is though. I probably already know enough to find it though assuming the terrain 
is not dense brush.<a href="../AndrewsCemetery/Andrews03.html"></br>
