Patterson Cemetery is 1/4
mile south of Hickman Lane on Pulaski Pike. Go past Hickman Lane and top the
hill. As you descend down other side you are .25 mile now so turn east (left)
into the farm lane. Old House is gone but a large barn stand in back. The
cemetery is in a grove of trees 50 yards behind (east) the barn on the right
next to the farm road. The road leads past the barn near a few pieces of
abandoned farm machinery.&nbsp;</br>
 Notice above the yellow arrow points to a clump of trees
behind a red barn next to the field road. The cemetery is in that clump of
trees.&nbsp;Go there only with permission.
