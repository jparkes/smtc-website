Feb 1839, aged 91 yrs. (Native of Caroline Co., Maryland; immigrated to 
Tenn. in 1803-1816.Revolutionary War Soldier DAR #626222; married Rebekah 
Fleming in 1766 Albany Co., N.Y. </font> <i><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Ref: Charlotte Covey - ccovey@sstelco.com)</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Arial"><br>

</font></i><font color="#660033" face="Arial">William Covey born 1748 in 
Caroline Co, MD, son of Matthew George Covey (1707-1783) and<br>
Mary Noble. He married Rebekah Fleming, born 1740 in Albany Co, NY, and died 15 
Oct 1833 in<br>
Maury Co, TN. She is also buried in the Pleasant Garden Cemetery, however we did 
not find a<br>
stone for her. Their marriage took place in 1766.<br>
<br>
During July, 1781 through 20 Apr 1782, William Covey served with the 4th MD 
Regiment. His DAR number<br>
is 626222. <br>
<br>
He shows up in Guilford Co, NC in the 1790 and 1800 census. The family was 
Methodist Episcopal<br>
by faith, and we found one reference in a history of Guilford County that the 
first Bishop of American<br>
Methodism, Francis Asbury, had stayed at their home on 31 Oct 1799, while 
preaching in that area.<br>
<br>
It is our understanding that he received bounty land in Maury Co, TN, for his 
service in the Revolutionary<br>
War. The date of their arrival is still in question. Many people say they were 
there in 1816, but some legal<br>
documents have their names on them as early as 1803 in Maury County (actually 
Williamson or Davidson County then.)<br>
<br>
I have not found him on a census record for 1810, but his youngest son Russell 
Ray Covey married Rachel<br>
Davis in Maury Co, TN, 21 Nov 1810.<br>
<br>
On an 1823 Tax List for Maury County he is shown to own 130 acres.<br>
