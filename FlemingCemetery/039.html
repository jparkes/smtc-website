GARDEN/FLEMING CEMETERY, CULLEOKA, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

This view looks over the cemetery to the southeast. The rock fence is on our
left and we can see the William Covey memorial in the center of the photo close
the sapling tree. The brush is so dense that we could not get good photos.</br>

Another view looking north at the row of graves. One can barely make out the
standing stones from this photo. Notice all the fallen and decaying trees.</br>

I was unable to determine what the excavation meant shown in this photo. I hope
this is not the work of grave robbers. There is nothing of monetary value
remaining in these old graveyards for anyone to dig up.</br>

This photo looks down the row to see the William O Fleming, Mary Fleming, Winny
Fleming and the baby Susan M. Fleming box tomb on the end. Notice the rock wall
surrounding a grave or multiple graves further on out.</br>
