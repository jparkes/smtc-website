PLEASANT GARDEN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH HISTORY<br/>
<br/>
In 1818, three circuit riders immigrated from Granville Co., N. C. to the area
several miles south of Columbia. These three, Rev. Nathaniel Moore, Robert Doak
and Levan Covy, purchased a lot from William Covey, who had arrived in the area
two years earlier and proceeded to organize a Methodist Church and to build a
simple log structure that served as a meeting
house for a number of years. After establishing this graveyard it is believed
this church was merged into the nearby church to the south at (Wilkes)
Campground Methodist Church then later in 1838 into the Culleoka Church, but the
community continued to use this graveyard for a while longer. <br/>
