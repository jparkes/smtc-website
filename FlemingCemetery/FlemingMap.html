Find the Fleming/Pleasant
Garden Methodist Church Cemetery by going north on Mooresville Pike from
Culleoka toward
Columbia a couple of miles. Turn left on Phinny Murphy (called Cross Rd on some maps) Road and go 3 tenths of a
mile and the road will bend left or south. Look to your right into the thicket
and back into there is the cemetery. It is thought the church building stood in front or
nearer the road than the cemetery.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"><i><br/>
