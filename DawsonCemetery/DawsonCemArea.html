The once Rock wall around this cemetery is no more. It would be very difficult
to do a comprehensive survey of this cemetery due to the random scattering of
the stones that were memorial in nature compared to the stones used for the rock
wall. There are large gapping pits (graves) of danger. The stones are sliding
into the holes and being slowly covered over time. There are no remaining
complete memorials here. Only fragments and broken pieces of memorials scattered
all around the cemetery area.<br/>

Restoration of this cemetery is still possible but it would be a challenge. Mr.
Fred Hawkins did not mention the degraded condition of this cemetery in 1987
indicating most of the damage has occurred since. Visited on a rainy day and all
the mosses and lichens have swelled and made the stones green and very
slippery. <i><span style="color: navy"><br/>
