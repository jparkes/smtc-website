<p align="center"><b>DAWSON
(JOHN)
CEMETERY,  MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
</b>From Mt. Pleasant take Southport Road east
toward Porter's Chapel and go one mile out of town. Look to your left (north)
out in a cow pasture. The cemetery is on top of a large mound left by phosphate
mining operations. It is marked by a grove of trees and a fallen rock wall. It
was on the Ray Floyd place in 1987.<a href="DawsonCemMap.html"><br/>

03 Apr 2008 on a stormy rainy Thursday with the a herd of cows peacefully
standing around observing from outside the rock wall. I had a talk with them
about staying a safe distance from me. They don't talk back and unlike people
they appear to listen too. Ha!</i><b> <br/>
