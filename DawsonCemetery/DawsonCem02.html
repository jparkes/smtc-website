DAWSON, John, Senr.,
17 Oct 1786 - 25 Nov 1843. 57-01-08. (Symbols of Masonic origin present. Top of
box tomb sunken deep into the grave pit and is in danger of being lost
underground. The top is also broken into several pieces.) Inscription as I think
it is: "SACRED to the memory of JOHN DAWSON, Senr' who was born October 17,
1786 and departed this life 25 November 1843 aged 57 years &amp; 1 month and 8
days." The inscription was uncovered and an attempt to clean it brought no
great success in the rainy weather and thus it is difficult to read from the
photo. There is a base of a box tomb beside the John Dawson memorial but
the top is gone or inverted.<i><span style="color: navy"><br/>
