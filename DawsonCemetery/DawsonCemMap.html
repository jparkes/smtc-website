&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
Mt. Pleasant take Southport Road east toward Porter's Chapel and go one mile
from the Rail Road Tracks. Look to your left (north) out in a cow pasture. The
cemetery is on top of a large mound left there by phosphate mining operations in
years past. It is marked by a grove of trees and a fallen rock wall with cattle
farming operations all around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><span style="color: navy"></br>
