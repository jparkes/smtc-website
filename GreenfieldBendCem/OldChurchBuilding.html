</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">I
could not resist photographing this little bit of history about a mile or so
east upon </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">the hill above Greenfield
Bend.</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> It obviously was an old church
building at one time. It might have also been used as a school. We know it was
built as a church because of the two front doors. There was one door for the
ladies, and one for </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">the men. They sat
on opposite sides of the building. Babies stayed with their mothers. There were
usually lots of Kids and they sat
down front and were made to behave.</br>
I don't know if this belongs under Greenfield Bend Cemetery because but it has a
history and needs to be uncovered.</br>
If you know the history of this old church building I would like </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">to
hear from you.&nbsp;</br>
