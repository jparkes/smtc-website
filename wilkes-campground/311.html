<b>RAMSEY, James Albert
&amp; Mary Lou Adkisson. James was born 8 Mar 1830 in Tennessee. He died 30 Sep
1908 in Maury County, Tennessee and was buried in Wilkes Cemetery, Culleoka,
Maury County, Tennessee. James married twice. I am not sure where his first
wife, Priscilla M. Warden, is buried, but it may be in the Shane Cemetery with
the other Warden kin. His second wife, Mary Lou Adkisson, is buried here beside
him. She was born on 22 Dec 1870 in Maury County, Tennessee. Mary was born 1 Jun
1848. She died 30 Oct 1902 and was buried in Wilkes Cemetery, Culleoka, Maury
County, Tennessee. Like his parents tombstone, this one is beginning to show its
age. A family member is trying to get new tombstones for them. Inscription: James Albert
