 PILKINTON, James, born No�.. (Mr. Hawkins in Maury
 County Cemeteries says the birth date is Nov 5, 1817, but the death date was
 unreadable then also. This is an 1850s era stone indicating the death was in
 that time frame. Wayne Austin). A note by James Pilkinton, 1/28/2004: The other
 stone in the group (they are all shaped the same) is Larkin and Nancy's son
 MINUS Pilkinton. He was born 5 Nov 1817 and died between 1853/1860. I know that
 this is his stone, because Marise Lightfoot Garrett did a reading back in the
 1960's in "They Passed This Way" in the Maury County Archives now and
 the stones were not as deteriorated then. His name was obliterated at the time
 but the date 5 Nov 1817 was visible. I know from the Larkin Pilkinton family
 bible that date matched to Minus' birth date. I believe the other Pilkinton
 stone you have listed between Tidwell and Larkin Pilkinton is actually the base
 for Minus Pilkinton's stone, at least that is the impression that I had from my
 visit to the cemetery. The Sarah Tidwell that is buried in Wilkes Cemetery is
 also Larkin and Nancy Pilkinton's daughter. Sarah E. Pilkinton married Green
 Bury Tidwell 23 July 1850. Larkin's brother Jesse Pilkinton moved to Maury
 County also for a time and Jesse's son James Smith Pilkinton left the Giles and
 Lawrence County Pilkinton/Pinkleton descendants. Most of the Maury Co.
 Pilkinton's decend from Larkin. James Pilkinton, a Pilkinton researcher
