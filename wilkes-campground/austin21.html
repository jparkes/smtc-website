</br><center><b>AUSTIN, Sadie Gladys 17 May 1905 - 14 Sep 1990, Sadie was the third of seven children
and the daughter of Charles Harris &amp; Otie Eva Kerr Austin. She was a 1932 graduate of University 
of Tennessee and spent her work life as a Tennessee State Social Worker in Johnson City. This simple 
stone is a reflection of her ways. She was however prominent and successful. She remained
unmarried but devoted to her siblings and parents. At 
one time in her career she was supervisor of the Social Workers from an eleven county area of East
Tennessee before her retirement sometime around 1970. <i>Information and 1992 photo by Wayne Austin.</i>
