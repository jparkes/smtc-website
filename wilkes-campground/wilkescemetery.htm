<P><font color="#000080" size="2">Wilkes - Campground is located near Culleoka
Tennessee off of Mooresville Pike. From Culleoka. Go west on Mooresville Pike to
Frank Moore Road. Turn Right and go 3/4 mile to Cemetery Road on the left and
turn left there. The Cemetery is down that road about 1/4 mile on the
right.&nbsp; The research and photography on this cemetery for this project was
done by Suzanne Hope Davison. She deserves our thanks for an outstanding
effort.&nbsp; If you have questions, comments or suggestions you may e-mail her
at <a href="leahy50@charter.net">leahy50@charter.net</a>&nbsp; Suzanne has made
an effort to place the graves in many cases by tracking the footstones.
Especially when one was misplaced. You should get a feel as to how many unmarked graves
there are in these old cemeteries. While it is
in&nbsp; small measure prime evidence of a family association to find an
unmarked grave next to a marked grave, one cannot just assume that the marked
and unmarked grave belong to the same family. We have assigned each unmarked
field stone a surname based on its proximity to others of a common surname
nearby we are in no way inferring that the person was of that surname. This was
done as a means identifying the location of the potential grave. We do not pretend to have
documented all of the unmarked graves in this cemetery. That is a very
complex&nbsp; task and cannot be done without a special tools &amp; procedures.&nbsp;</font><P><b>
