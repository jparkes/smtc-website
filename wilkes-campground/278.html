<br/><b>FLEMING, Unknown by
Martha H. Fleming. It is obvious this is a grave marker because someone went to
the trouble to plant flowers around the stone. I Believe this is a type flower
that keeps coming back year after year sometimes for a hundred or more years. It
is very hardy here in the south and is used traditionally around grave sites.
Unfortunately the name of the flower escapes me. <i>Photo and information by Suzanne
