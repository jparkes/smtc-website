Dickson was born in Guilford County, NC 7 Dec 1784 and died 14 Apr 1859 in Maury
County (Culleoka). I believe her stone once read &quot;Nancy Pilkinton wife of
Larkin&quot;.) This is an 1850s era stone indicating the death was in that time
frame which confirms Mr. Fred's &amp; James Pilkinton's confirmation of the
death date. I
don't know who was carving that style stone in the Culleoka area in the 1850s,
but they carved many that crumpled to dust in a hundred years. Shane Cemetery
has a couple of these along with Friendship Cemetery also, by Wayne Austin</font></b><CENTER><b>. Photo
