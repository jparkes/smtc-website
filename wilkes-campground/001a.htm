OUR HISTORY<br>
This month, we resume our continuing (I hope- if you give me some of your
ancestor information) series on the history of the ancestors of Camp 1828
members. This month, Jim Kannon of Brentwood, Tennessee shares his personal
family history.<br>
<br>
Merritt Booker Tomlinson was born in Culleoka, Maury County, Tennessee in 1840
and died there in 1939, a few weeks short of his 100th birthday. Merritt was the
product of a family with a proud military tradition. His grandfather Jesse
Tomlinson and his great-grandfather Charles Allen had served in the War of 1812,
in companies from Maury County. His parents were Charles A. and Sallie Foster
Tomlinson. Before the Yankee invasion of the South, Merritt was a farmer and
surveyor. He had attended school at the Old Brick Academy at Pleasant Grove and
later graduated from Wesleyan<br>
University in Florence, Alabama. At the beginning of the war, he and his three
brothers all enlisted in the Confederate service, but in different units.
Merritt joined Brown�s (later, Clark�s) Third TN Infantry, Company F. This
regiment was captured at the surrender of Fort Donaldson, and its members were
later paroled or exchanged. After the Third was reorganized, Merritt<br>
transferred to the 48th TN Infantry, Company F (Voohries� 48th), where he
served until the surrender of the Army of Tennessee at Bentonville, North
Carolina. He reached the rank of Captain. During the Battle of Pine Mountain,
Georgia, in 1864, Captain Tomlinson was only 100 yards away from where General
Leonidas Polk, also from Maury County, was killed by a cannon ball. The major
battle involving the 48th was the Battle of Nashville. The 48th served as rear
guard for the retreating Army, under General Forrest. Captain Tomlinson was the
Provost Marshall of Walthall�s Division, under General Stewart at the close of
the war. Following the war, Merritt returned to Culleoka and married 16 year old
Sally (Mildred) Dillard, daughter of Richard M. Dillard. Mister Dillard had been
a member of Coleman�s Scouts<br>
of the 9th TN Cavalry and was wounded, captured and �allowed� to die for
refusing to take the Union Oath of Allegiance. Captain Tomlinson and his wife
had nine children, one of whom, Willie Tomlinson Cochran Corey was the great
grandmother of Jim Kannon, our compatriot. It is said that Captain Tomlinson
walked home at the end of the war, arriving on a Friday. By<br>
Monday, he was out plowing with a team of oxen, as there were no horses left in
the area. He was later asked by some of the neighbors if he would teach school
if they did his plowing. There had been no school during the war and parents
wished to give their children an education. Captain Tomlinson did teach school
for several years but eventually returned to farming. When he reached his
nineties, Captain Tomlinson was interviewed every year by a reporter from the
local paper. He was always asked the secret to his long life, and he gave
different answers each year. When he was 98, he told the reporter he had lived
so long because he disobeyed all rules and orders of doctors. He may have been
joking. At his death in March of 1939, Captain Tomlinson was the oldest Veteran
in Maury County, one of the oldest in the state and he may have been the oldest
Mason in the US at that time. There<br>
is a display of some of Captain Tomlinson�s artifacts at Elm Springs, the SCV
headquarters.<br>

Jill Garrett<br>
<br>
On March 6, 1939, the plaintive sound of taps echoes through the valley along
Fountain Creek, and in Columbia the courthouse bell tolled in mourning. Captain
Merritt Booker Tomlinson was being buried that afternoon at old Wilkes Cemetery
and an era in Maury County history had come to an end.<br>
<br>
Tomlinson was the last surviving Confederate soldier in Maury County and was
also one of the last commissioned officers in the entire country. Dying only a
few months before his 99th birthday, he was the oldest Mason in the United
States.<br>
<br>
His family had a proud military heritage dating from the county�s earliest
settlement as his grandfather Jesse Tomlinson and great-grandfather Charles
Allen had both served during the War of 1812 in Maury County companies.<br>
<br>
Tomlinson�s boyhood home still stands on the Valley Creek Road about two miles
from Culleoka and today is the Lewis Tyler home. Here he lived with his parents
Charles Allen and Sallie Foster Tomlinson.<br>
<br>
One of his brothers, Jesse Tomlinson, was the father of the late Pride
Tomlinson, Sr., justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Another brother, Joseph,
ran away while still a boy to join the Confederate Army.<br>
<br>
Merritt Tomlinson was educated at Old Brick Academy at Pleasant Grove and later
graduated from Wesleyan University at Florence, Alabama. He was a student at the
college when the war began. (This school later became Florence State University
and today is the University of North Alabama.)<br>
<br>
In May 1861 he enlisted in the 48th Tennessee Infantry in a company composed of
Culleoka men. His regiment was surrendered at Fort Donelson in Feb. 1862 and
shipped on prison boats to prisoner of war camps - Tomlinson remembered the
conditions aboard these boats as being appalling. For eight months he was a
prisoner at Camp Douglas in Chicago, and following his exchange he saw action in
Mississippi and Georgia.<br>
<br>
During the fighting at Pine Mountain, Georgia, in 1864 he was only about 100
yards away when General Leonidas Polk (formerly of Maury County) was killed when
his chest was shattered by a cannon ball.<br>
<br>
During Hood�s retreat through the county in Dec. 1864, young Merritt passed
within a mile of his home. As he was almost barefooted, he was permitted to go
home to get a pair of shoes.<br>
<br>
After the surrender of the Confederate Army, he made his way slowly home,
arriving home one Friday. By Monday morning he was out in the fields plowing
using oxen as there were no horses left on the farm and it was necessary that a
crop be made that year.<br>
<br>
One day as he was plowing, a number of his neighbors, all former soldiers, came
to him and asked him to teach their children. Schools had not been in session
during the war and for almost four years education had been at a standstill.
They told him if he would teach that they would do his plowing. After several
years as a teacher, Tomlinson returned to farming.<br>
<br>
In 1866 he married sixteen year old Mildred Dillard, whose father had been a
Confederate scout and had died during the war. They made their home at Beechwood
and raised a family of nine children. Beechwood burned a few years ago.<br>
<br>
When he reached his nineties, Tomlinson was interviewed each year by a reporter
from the Daily Herald. One year he told the reporter that the secret of his
great age was that he had lived a life in the open, avoided dissipation, and had
eaten wholesome food all his life � with the exception of those years in the
army. His ideal night meal, and one he had for many years, was only bread and
milk.<br>
<br>
At the age of 98, however, he finally confessed the real reason for his
remarkable longevity when he said with a twinkle in his eye that he attributed
his age to the fact that he had always disobeyed all orders and rules of the
doctors.<br>
<br>
In 1938 Captain Tomlinson, then 98, was invited to speak to the student body at
Central High School (where today�s Whitthorne is) on Robert E. Lee�s
birthday. He walked from downtown Columbia to the school and following the
address walked back to town. Only a few weeks before his death he was still
riding horseback over his farm.<br>
<br>
His lifetime spanned from the coming of the railroad to the age of air travel.
In 1859 when the first railroad came into the county he had ridden on the first
run, going from his home at Culleoka to Athens, Alabama, the end of the line at
that time.<br>
<br>
He had seen young Maurians first go off to war in Mexico in 1846 and at his
death Nazi soldiers were goose-stepping in Germany. Although he did not live to
see the outbreak of World War II, he had a strange premonition about Adolf
Hitler and in one of his last interviews regretted to see that dictator�s rise
to prominence in Europe.</font><b><p align="center"><font color="#800000"  size="2"><i><br>
