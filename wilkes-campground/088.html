 ABERNATHY, Mary K., July 16, 1847 Sept. 2, 1910. Mary K. Abernathy was the wife
 of Cornelius B. Abernathy. She was the daughter of Washington Layfayette
 Jefferson Wilkes and Jane Crokett Love. Some have reported her to be Mary
 Kennedy Wilkes, daughter of William H. Wilkes and Zurilda Amis. Their daughter,
 Mary, was married to Thomas E. Andrews, as I first found in Goodspeed Histories
 and then in marriage records. When I first ran across the listing for Mary
 Kennedy Wilkes being married to Cornelius Abernathy, I thought this was a first
 husband and Goodspeed reported the 2nd marriage as it was the current one. I
 looked on the 1880 Census and Mary Abernathy is listed as a widow with 2
 daughters Lela and Neely in Maury County, Tennessee. Mary K. Andrews is listed
 in the 1880 Williamson County, Tennessee with her husband Thomas E. Andrews and
 son W. W. Andrews - making it clear there were two different girls. Further
 research revealed that Mary K. Abernathy was the daughter of Washington and
 Jane Love Wilkes.
