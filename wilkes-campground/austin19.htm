<font color="#800000" size="2" ><b>AUSTIN, Charles Harris 28 Nov 1879 - 20 Nov 1969 was a native of Lincoln County Tennessee. He 
was the son of James Walter and Sarah Elizabeth Epps Austin. Otie Eva Kerr AUSTIN was the daughter of Joseph 
Jerome and Elizabeth Violet Ausban Kerr. Charles &amp; Otie married on Oct 14, 1900 and had seven children, 6 
of which lived a long, healthy and successful life. The Austins were married nearly 70
years or until Charles' death in 1969. 
They were a farm family whose home and farm was located high upon the hill above
Culleoka toward McCains on what 
is today (2003) the Westmoreland Place called Peach Orchard Hill. <i>Information and 1992 photo by Wayne Austin (a
grandson). It was a personal characteristic of Charles to tilt his head when in
a relaxed standing or sitting position. This is a trait that was inherited by
many of the male descendents of Charles. The photographer/artist in the above
photo straightened his head leaving his shoulders slanted.</i></b></font>
