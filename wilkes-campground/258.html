&nbsp;<CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></center><b>TYLER, James A. 1875-1957,
/ TYLER, Laura E. 1884-1937. (daughter of James Walter &amp; Sara Elizabeth Epps
Austin).<i> </i>James was the son of James M. &amp; Ella Burkett Tyler<i>. </i>
(The tombstone is believed to be in error. Her birth year 1884)<i> The Tylers lived out on Peach Orchard Road for many years of their life. When
Laura became sick they moved in with their daughter Willie Hight on Seavy Hight Road. Page 131 of the Wilkes cemetery records lists Laura Tyler as
passing from cerebral hemorrhage and died at age 53, and born 1884, info given
by Mrs. Seavy Hight her daughter. (This record was given to me (Dianna Taplin)
by Bill Inmon). [Commentary by Wayne 7/10/03): I believe Mr. Hawkins records are correct on page
505 when he states: Death notice: Ellen Tyler, born 2/10/1884 and died 6/10/1938. If so her full name was: Laura Ellen (Austin) Tyler, born 2/10/1884 and died 6/10/1938.
Though, I don't know where the 1938 came from. All other records point to 1937 as the death date.]
