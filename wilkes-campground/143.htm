 William Harris Wilkes. He was a widower having been married previously to
 Zurilda's sister, Mary Kennedy Amis, who died in 1855, leaving W. H. with three
 small children at home. W. H. and Zurilda had one child - a daughter for which
 Zurilda named Mary Kennedy Wilkes, in honor of her sister. Zurilda Wilkes died
 on 28 Feb 1860 from consumption and was laid to rest at Wilkes-Campground
