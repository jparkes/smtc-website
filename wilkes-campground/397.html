</i><u>JOHN CALVIN FLEMING<br/>
</u></b> One of the well known residents of Culleoka is John Calvin
Fleming, who was born in Scotts Hill on the 23rd of February, 1879, a son of
Jack W. and Luella (Coffey) Fleming, both natives of Tennessee. The mother is
one of the Coffeys of North Carolina (actually the Coffee grandparents) who were
among the pioneer settlers of this state. She had a brother, Ike (Isaac
H. Coffey, 1828-1868, (WA 2010)),
who was in the Civil war, serving as an officer in the Confederate army. He was
captain in Forrest's Scouts. He met his death at the hands of "reconstructionists
of the carpetbagger" type because of his views on secession. Although for
many years he had been an extensive slave owner (Leulla's
Father Calvin Coffee was an extensive slave owner, (WA 2010)) he
was not primarily a secessionist until influenced by his sons (Isaac
only had one son who was a child at the time of his death in 1868, (WA 2010))
, who were radicals, and he suffered the consequences of his decisions. He was
carried to his home and prepared for burial by the citizens. <br/>
Jack W. Fleming was a successful farmer and representative citizen of the
community in which he resided. <br/>
John Calvin Fleming received his education in the public schools of Maury county
and after completing the work of the grade schools he went to Texas and there
engaged in the purchase of cotton, becoming connected with the Neverille Round
Bale Gin Company. Some twelve months later he returned to his native county and
engaged in the mercantile business with the W. J. Gilbreath Company. He worked
for that concern for some eight or nine years and then purchased the business
and conducted it on his own account for about three years. At the end of that
time he sold out and removed to Florence, Alabama, engaging in the livery
business. He was active in that connection for some time and subsequently
returned to Maury county and took up residence in Culleoka, where he has since
resided, and he is readily conceded to be one of the foremost citizens of the
town, county and state. He is public-spirited and has contributed in a great
degree to the development and improvement of this section of the state. <br/>
On the 1st of January, 1905, was celebrated the marriage of Mr. Fleming to Miss
Minnie A. Hancock, a daughter of Noah Hancock. Her maternal grandfather was Col.
George T. Nixon, who served throughout the Mexican war and also the Civil War.
To the union of Mr. and Mrs. Fleming the following children have been born:
Henry and Luther Thomas (twins); Florence Louise; John, Jr.; N. H. and J. W.
(twins); Emmett Nathan; William Marvin; and Fred Gilbreath and Flo Fans
(twins). <br/>
Since attaining his majority Mr. Fleming has been a stanch supporter of the
democratic party and the principles for which it stands. He maintains an active
interest in party affairs but has never sought nor desired public preferment.
His religious faith is that of the Cumberland Presbyterian church. <br/>
Since early manhood Mr. Fleming has taken an active interest in military
affairs. He was a member of the Tennessee National Guard from 1905 until 1916,
and for eight years in succession was a member of the championship rifle team
which competed at Seagirt, New Jersey. He served on the Mexican border with the
First Tennessee Regiment and was promoted from a lieutenancy to the rank of
battalion adjutant. Due to an injury sustained while in the border service Mr.
Fleming was unable to accompany his regiment to France during the World war.<br/>
