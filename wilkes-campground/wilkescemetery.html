<p>Wilkes - Campground is located near Culleoka
Tennessee off of Mooresville Pike. From Culleoka. Go west on Mooresville Pike to
Frank Moore Road. Turn Right and go 3/4 mile to Cemetery Road on the left and
turn left there. The Cemetery is down that road about 1/4 mile on the
right.  The research and photography on this cemetery for this project was
done by Suzanne Hope Davison. She deserves our thanks for an outstanding
effort.  If you have questions, comments or suggestions you may e-mail her
at <a href="leahy50@charter.net">leahy50@charter.net</a>  Suzanne has made
an effort to place the graves in many cases by tracking the footstones.
Especially when one was misplaced. You should get a feel as to how many unmarked graves
there are in these old cemeteries. While it is
in  small measure prime evidence of a family association to find an
unmarked grave next to a marked grave, one cannot just assume that the marked
and unmarked grave belong to the same family. We have assigned each unmarked
field stone a surname based on its proximity to others of a common surname
nearby we are in no way inferring that the person was of that surname. This was
done as a means identifying the location of the potential grave. We do not pretend to have
documented all of the unmarked graves in this cemetery. That is a very
complex  task and cannot be done without a special tools &amp; procedures. </p><p><b>
