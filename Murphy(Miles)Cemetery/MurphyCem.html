<p align="center"><b>MURPHY
(Miles P.) CEMETERY, MACK BENDERMAN RD.<br/>
<br/>
An endangered
Cemetery<br/>
<br/>
</b>(From Porter's
Chapel take Southport Rd. to Mack Benderman Road go past the right turn off of
to Preacher Holt Rd. Go about � mile further and turn into the trailer park
entrance road. Trailers will be on the left. Cemetery directly south west from
here. Go 300 yards and turn right into a field road that goes along the left of
a tree covered hill. Go to the Crooked Oak tree among all the others and look
left and into the cemetery. It is under the trees behind (to the south) the
crooked white oak tree that leans to your right out of the tree line. It is
across a dry branch.<br/>
<br/>
The photographer started on the northeast corner of the cemetery and went south
and then across to the next row west and then north on that row and continued to
follow that pattern until the last stone found was photographed. There were
several skips and at least three field stones noticed.<br/>
