a tree covered hill. Go to the Crooked Oak tree among all the others and look
left and into the cemetery. It is under the trees behind (to the south) the

The photographer started on the northeast corner of the cemetery and went south
and then across to the next row west and then north on that row and continued to
follow that pattern until the last stone found was photographed. There were
several skips and at least three field stones noticed.<br>
