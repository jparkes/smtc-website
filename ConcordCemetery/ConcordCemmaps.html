<b>This Aerial view
shows that there might be a small line of trees obscuring your view of the cemetery
from the Monsanto road. This is Mr. Fred Hawkins directions in 1987. 
</b><b>
Go out Williamsport Pike (Hwy. #50) to Monsanto Road and turn right. Just before
reaching the main Monsanto plant you will see the cemetery on your right. I 
don't know if that plant exist today.</b><b></br>
