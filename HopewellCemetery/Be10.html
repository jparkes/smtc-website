EAST NASHVILLE HIT; INJURED POUR INTO HOSPITALS OF CITY<br/>
<b>Terrific Winds Sweep State; Son Buried
in Debris Tells Father of Dead Mother By His Side.<br/>
Three people are known to be dead while more than 50 are injured here, all
caught in the wake of a wind of tornado proportions which struck at 7:30 o'clock
last night, throwing the entire city into darkness as it spent the most of its
wrath on East Nashville. The known dead two hours after the storm struck are
Mrs. T. L. Benderman, 50, 115 McFerrin avenue, B. B. Lanier, 1617 Franklin
avenue, and a small girl, Margaret Johnson, Myrtle avenue. Working by candle
light, 20 nurses and as many doctors at General hospital were working over
broken legs, arms and backs. The halls and all available space was filled with
the injured, brought there in private cars and ambulances which worked their way
through the storm-torn East Nashville streets. As the entire police and fire
departments battled against the darkness which lasted long after the storm, in
an effort to extricate the injured from twisted and burning buildings, stories
of heroism and suffering began to come from stricken area. When the home of T.
L. Benderman was battered down by the sudden wind, only Mrs. Benderman and
Clark, her 17-year-old son, were trapped in the wreckage. Mr. Benderman,
standing nearby, heard his son call, faintly from beneath the mass that was once
his seven-room frame home. He answered, "Mama is dead," the boy,
trapped there beside the form of his mother, called back to him. Another son,
Clyde Benderman, his wife, Bonnie, and their five children, were in another part
of the house furthest from where the wind first struck. All of them escaped
injury. Mrs. Quinn Patterson, a nurse living in the home was injured and taken
to General hospital. The extent of her injuries were not reported some time
after the tragedy. She had been attending Mr. and Mrs. T. L. Benderman, who were
in failing health.<br/>
