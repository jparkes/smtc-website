WALKER, John E., 30 Sep 1848 - 25 Feb 1916. (Son William &amp; Margaret
Alexander Walker,&nbsp;</br>
both of N. C.)&nbsp;</br>
and</br>
WALKER, Jennie Peoples, 16 Jar. 1865 - 30 Jan 1934. &quot;Wife of John E.
Walker.&quot; (Daughter of Reverend James H. Peoples, former minister of this
Hopewell Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church.) John E. has the distinction of
having the earliest memorial stone in this cemetery. There is always the
possibility that there are unmarked graves that are earlier though. &nbsp;<i></br>
