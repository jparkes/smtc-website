This map shows the GPS as: N 35.69707, W 87.22758. From Columbia go east out on 
Hwy 50 Williamsport Pike passing Williamsport. Go another 1/2 mile and the 
cemetery is out in the field on a knoll next to a branch running north/south. 
This place in years past was owned by Mrs Bratton.<br/>

This road map shows the Williamsport Pike route and that one must cross the Duck 
River and look left after covering the 1/2 mile needed beyond Williamsport. I 
rather think the cemetery is closer to that branch that runs around it as it 
seems above. <br/>

With this aerial view
one I believe this cemetery resides in one of these little clumps of brush that 
over look that branch (stream). This is high enough above the branch to be an 
ideal place for a cemetery. I have placed three yellow checks to indicate places 
around which I would investigate to find this cemetery. <br/>
