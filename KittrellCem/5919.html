  most of the memorials.&nbsp;</br>

  </b></font><b>This is about the worst thicket I
  have ever tackled without using brush cutting equipment. When I first went
  into this area of the cemetery (surrounded by a separate wrought iron fence) I
  could only see the corner of the large family monument shown above. After
  there and kicking around and mashing briars down in the bush I uncovered one
  of the footstones. That was photographed and I continued displacing the vines
  and discovering more. When I had found all I could the above record is the
  result. The writers of &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; in about 1963 were the
  last researchers who found these stones. Mr. Fred Hawkins did not find them in
  1987. That is understandable given how well hidden in the bush they were. In
  my haste I forgot that I had a machete in the trunk of the car and could have
  cut some of the brush away instead of tearing and pushing the vines to the
  side. It was 4:45 PM and this was the last photos of some 1200 for the long
  day and I tiredly headed back to Alabama.</br>
  My recommendation to the caretaker committee of the Kittrell Cemetery is to
  take the side of the fence down between these monuments and the main cemetery
  and include this area in the maintenance. Use brush killer the first time and
  then clear the dead brush. The area can be mowed after that as it will hardly
  add five minutes to the mowing.</br>
