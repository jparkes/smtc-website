Obituary for A.B. Cathey from Columbia Herald, Jan 21 1916:<br>
Born, lived 90 Years, Died on Same Tract of Land; Unusual Career of A.B. Cathey 
of Cathey's Creek comes to end. He was a splendid citizen. Survived by wife and 
twelve children and was probably the oldest resident in his section of the 
county; funeral tomorrow.<br>
A.B., probably the oldest resident of Cathey's creek section of Maury County 
died this morning in his ninetieth year. Mr. Cathey was born, lived all of his 
life and died upon the same tract of land that was entered from the state by his 
father, the late James Cathey and his brother, more than a century ago. There 
are very few instances where this has occurred in the history of the county. The 
house in which he died was not very far from the place where the house of his 
birthplace stood.<br>
Mr. Cathey was one of the best men in this community, leading and exemplary 
life, being a pillar in the Christian Church and for years a leader in the 
community. He is survived by twelve children and his wife, the latter being 
seventy eight years of age. She is a sister of former Representative Mumford 
Smith of Mr. Pleasant.<br>
The following children survive Mr. Cathey: W.A. Cathey, James Cathey, Mumford 
Cathey, Tom Cathey, Mrs John Delk, Mrs Anderson Kennedy, Mrs Alec Grimmett, all 
of the county and Mrs R.C. White of Texas; Mrs T.J. Kirk, of Texas; Mrs Robert 
Kirk of Texas and Mrs E.M. Tarpley of Franklin, Ky.<br>
Mr. Cathey lived all of his life a true and consistent Christian and was a loyal 
husband, a devoted father, and enjoyed the respect of all his neighbors.<br>
The services will be held tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock at the Cathey's Creek 
Christian Church and will be conducted by Elder W.S. Morton.<br>
