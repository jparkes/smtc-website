Black Arrow on the above map is pointing at the Kittrell Cemetery. This is north
of Hwy 412 and Hampshire (near county line) is on our left with Columbia being
on our right.&nbsp;<br>
Go west on Hwy 412/99 several miles and veer right or northwest onto Taylors
Store Rd. Keep that for about a mile and turn west or left on Catheys Creek Road
for about 2 miles and turn north across the Catheys Creek onto Stephenson
Schoolhouse Rd and go about 1/4 mile to the Cathey's Creek Church of Christ.
Look up the hill straight ahead at the tree line and go straight ahead into a
private drive and the cemetery will be on that road about 50 yards up the road on
the slope on your right. Look to your right at the Chain Link fence and gate
into the cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
Go to this cemetery with love and appreciation for your/the heritage of this
great community. Going there for any other reason will invoke the fierce loyalty
of this community and you will wind up in deep trouble.<br>
