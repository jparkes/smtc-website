Lewisburg Highway, Maury County Tennessee<br/>

This map provides the
GPS coordinates of this cemetery. It is my belief this is correct.<br/>

Take Highway 50 out of 
Columbia and turn south on Culleoka Road Hwy 373. Go past Culleoka toward 
Mooresville about 2 miles and turn into a driveway that doubles as a residential 
road. With permission climb up the road and the cemetery is next to the road on 
our left.<br/>

    <b>This
is an aerial photo of the Holt Cemetery. You will have to use the drives just
west of the major southward bend in the Lewisburg Highway to get to this
cemetery. There are houses &amp; buildings all around. The driveway does appear to
be
the right of way marked on the Topographical Maps, but if you believe you have the
correct right of way be courteous to the nearby neighbors because you will need
to cross someone's front yard to visit the cemetery and you are using roads that 
very rarely get used as a cemetery access.<br/>
