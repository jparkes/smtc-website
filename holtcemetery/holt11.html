<b>HOLT, Ann K., no dates.<i>
</i>Here is where experience and observation begins to pay off. Based on what I
have seen as the style and sculpture of this stone, I believe this stone would 
have been cut in the 1850s. So that suggest that Ann K. Holt died in the 1850s. 
I know of about ten other stones identical to the style here in nearby cemeteries 
and they are all 1850s death dates.<i><br/>
