<b>CHILES, Lillie, no
dates. Believe this is the Black section of the Cemetery. Looks to me like there
might be a readable date buried under ground, but to dig it up may cause this
stone to fall over flat. I can make out "LIZZIE CHILDS DIED _A". This
inscribed field stone lies about 50 feet from the nearest inscribed stone of the
Holt family. It was a common practice for there to be a designated area of the
cemetery for burial of the slaves, when slavery was practiced prior to the 1860s.
That practice continued even after slavery as some slaves converted to paid
workers and were still part of the larger family of the white former owner.<br/>
