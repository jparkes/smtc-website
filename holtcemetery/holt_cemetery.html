<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy">Holt Cemetery is out the Mooresville Pike east of
Culleoka three miles, on the right. It is near houses and has manicured lawns
around it but the brush is largely left to grow in the cemetery. Be prepared to
avoid the Poison Ivy if you visit there during the summer time. I did however
eliminate some of it during my visit.&nbsp; If you have
relatives or are just interested you should consider making a contribution to the
upkeep of this cemetery.&nbsp;There are definitely slave graves on the outskirts
of this cemetery marked with field stones. Someone showed ingenuity in their
attempt at inscribing at least one of the fieldstones with a name &amp; date. </span></h1>
