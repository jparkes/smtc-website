</FONT><font color="#800000"><font size="2">I plotted two spots on this map, 
pointed out by the crossing arrows. Using proximity to determine the cemetery 
location it is thought the cemetery is split across both spots Both have small 
stands of trees and from this vantage appears to have fences around them.<br>

</font><font color="#800000" size="2">From Carter's Creek Station take Cleburne Rd. north for one mile and turn
left on Petty Lane. Go 1/2 mile to
old Flannigan place, now owned by a Nashville family. The cemetery is on back of
property.<br>

This close in map shows the two fenced areas. According to one source there are 
graves on both areas and that the two areas were at one time one cemetery that a 
past farmer tilled the soil in the center part arbitrarily separating the two 
areas into two cemeteries.</font></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font  color="#800000" size="2"><b><br>
