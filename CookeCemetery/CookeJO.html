JOHN O. COOKE, inscription, back of stone: "J.
O. Cooke was born in St. Marys Co., Maryland; at age of six months was removed
to Culpepper Co., Va. and thence to Greenville Dist., S.C. at nine years of age.
Came to Tenn. in 1806, vas married to S. Morgan on 27 Dec 1807. His wife was a<br/>
meek, kind, affectionate and devoted Christian, to know her was to love and
admire her virtues. These two lived together in great peace and harmony, within
one-half mile of this place for more than 60 years. And while their spirits are
in paradise their flesh rests here in Hope."<br/>
