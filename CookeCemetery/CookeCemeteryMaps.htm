I believe this to be the location of the cemetery as Mr John Allen says it is 
about 300 yards southwest of the old barn on a knoll in the middle of a field. 
Further he says that travel down a slope and back up to the cemetery. On the 
above maps there is a knoll and the three lined thicket is about in the center 
of the hill top. Of course they are in the process of clearing the trees so in 
the future one should be able to spot the stone with this kind of map. It is at:

There are maps out there such as Delorme and MS Streets &amp; Trips that have this 
coordinates on it and that is the reason I never found this cemetery when 
researching this area of the Maury County:&nbsp;

These are wrong so do not go there.</font></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080">From
Williamsport, take Cross Bridges Rd. and go 1 &amp; 1/2 miles. Turn left on
Jimmy Gray Robinson Road. After about 1 mile go into the private drive about 500 
yards east of the bend in the road back north. The residential road is on your 
left and the
cemetery will be down a field road southwest of the home. Go by the home on the 
west side and continue on the field road on the west side of two barns and after 
you pass the really old barn go another 300 yards toward the southwest to a 
knoll and the cemetery is on that knoll. 4109 Jimmy Gray Robinson is not the

I can't be absolutely certain of the location therefore (yellow pointer) I will not be correcting this with the GNIS until I get a
