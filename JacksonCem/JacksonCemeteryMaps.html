This cemetery is located on Old Sowell Mill Pike (on the left going south) about
1/2 mile east of Antioch Church of Christ. Go Sowell Mill Pike and turn right or
south on Old Sowell Mill Pike and travel 1/2 mile and the cemetery is upon a
hill under the Cedars on your left. It (in 2008) is a well kept community
Cemetery which was also found to be so by Mr. Fred Lee Hawkins in 1986.</b><i><br/>
