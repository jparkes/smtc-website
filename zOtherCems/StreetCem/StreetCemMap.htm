This road map shows the Street Cemetery along Bear Creek Pike &amp; south of and 
above the creek and highway. I have been to this area, but did not take to time 
to specifically locate this cemetery.<br>

I have placed a red check where the GPS locater says the cemetery is located. I 
have not yet found this cemetery so don't know if this is accurate or not. There were private 
land issues the day I was in that area. <br>

Mr Fred Hawkins instruction 1987:</font><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"> 
Turn off Bear Creek Pike (Hwy. 99) at Mt. Olivet Rd. and cross bridge. Take left 
fork (Newt Hood Rd) and go 1/2 mile. Enter the
driveway on left to J. N. &quot;Buddy' Hood's residence. Cemetery is on the hillside 
to right of the driveway.<br>
