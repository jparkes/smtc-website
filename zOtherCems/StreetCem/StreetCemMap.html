This map shows the GPS Coordinates for the Street Cemetery which are important for
finding it. <br/>

This road map shows the Street Cemetery along Bear Creek Pike &amp; south of and 
above the creek and highway. I have been to this area, but did not take to time 
to specifically locate this cemetery.<br/>

I have placed a red check where the GPS locater says the cemetery is located. I 
have not yet found this cemetery so don't know if this is accurate or not. There were private 
land issues the day I was in that area. <br/>


Mr Fred Hawkins instruction 1987: 
Turn off Bear Creek Pike (Hwy. 99) at Mt. Olivet Rd. and cross bridge. Take left 
fork (Newt Hood Rd) and go 1/2 mile. Enter the
driveway on left to J. N. "Buddy' Hood's residence. Cemetery is on the hillside 
to right of the driveway.<br/>
