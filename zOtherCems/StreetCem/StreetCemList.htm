            <p><font color="#660033" face="Comic Sans MS">James Park Street was one of Columbia's most important
            citizens during the first couple of decades of the 1900s, was a son of Park and Mary J. Street. The J. P. 
            Street, listed above, died at 8 years of age. It is likely that James Parke, who vas born the next year, was given
            the same name, in memory of his dead brother. See Rose 
            Hill listings for information about James Parke Street.<br>
