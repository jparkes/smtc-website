CEMETERY, LEE ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

This old
Topographical map dated in the 1950s shows the area of the cemetery layed out
several yards from the road and occupying many square feet of ground. It is just
on the edge of another drop in elevation from the 800 foot line. I think the new
housing development lies on the east side of that brown elevation line for the
Jones-Lovett Cemetery but the Foster-Lee Cemetery east and across from there is inside
the development.</br>

We have marked in red the spot about where the one stone is still standing for
this cemetery, but believe the area encompassing the cemetery lies largely to
the north if the mapping is correct.
