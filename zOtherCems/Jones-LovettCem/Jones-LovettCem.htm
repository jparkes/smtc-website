<p align="center"><b>JONES-LOVETT
CEMETERY, LEE ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
Called Lovett Cemetery on USGS maps.
</br>
Go out Bear Creek Pike and turn north on Blackburn Rd and then turn left on
Clara Mathis Rd and then go about 2 miles and turn right on Lee Rd. Go about 500
yards and the lone standing stone is on your right up an old hedge row under the
line of trees. The stone has been cleaned and is bright white and can be seen
from the road on the right side and about 40 yards in front of a new home.

<b>Confirming Mr. Fred Hawkins &amp; Dwain
Bradley's findings this researcher found one stone standing and that was for Ed
Frank Jones. There were other minor evidences of a graveyard, but I did not
examine them in detail because there were no visible inscribed memorials. I did
see across the fence line bulldozer work whereby stones were present that
appeared to be for graves. They appeared to be made of decorative concrete and
did not appear to have inscriptions from a distance. They were at least one in
number, but broken and piled up from the dozer work in the new yard. It is
possible that they were from the Foster-Lee Cemetery which was across from this
one. Because there was no proof they were gravestones and they were piled on
private land I did not examine them further.</b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Hawkins says this about what he
found in 1986:</br>
The only inscribed stone, that of Ed Frank Jones, had been turned over and
covered with earth. Mr. Dwain Bradley, who farms the neighboring place, took me
to the cemetery. Mr. V. P. Lunn later returned with me and we sought for other
graves but found nothing. This is just across the fence from the Foster-Lee
Graveyard.</br>
