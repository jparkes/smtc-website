</b><b>Not sure I can
place this cemetery on a map. Park Station is not marked but is west of I-65
Exit 37. The cemetery likely is on one
of the hill tops to the west and south of I-65 on Hwy 50 as Bill stated. It can be found
probably in a clump of trees as farmers know there are burials there and will
not usually clear the land there. </b><b>Parks
Station was a post office and depot on the Duck River Valley Railroad in the
Silver Creek area at a time when the rails came thru this place. The post office
was discontinued in 1903. <i>Wayne Austin
