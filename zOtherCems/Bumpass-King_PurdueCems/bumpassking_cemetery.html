</b><b>This cemetery is composed of lost 
graves - records of which were kept and passed along by a family member who 
lived in Texas years ago. As preserved by the Historical Authors of Cemetery 
books, who were Evelyn Shackleford &amp; Marise Lightfoot &amp; Fred Lee Hawkins in 
Maury County Tennessee.</b></p>
<p><b>The above information is quoted from "They 
Passed This Way", page A-121: 'Names and dates furnished by Mrs. James E. Bellew 
of Summertown, Lawrence Co., Tennessee., via Mrs. Marie Garland, Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma. This was thought be be in the 1960s.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Fred Hawkins added this in about 1988. "Mrs. Davis, a neighbor who was more 
than 90 years of age, said that she could remember the last funeral held at this 
place. The old Bumpass house is now abandoned and ready to fall down. Searched 
for on 3 Mar 1988 and not found"<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Fred wrote out these instructions in 1988 for finding this fieldstone marked 
cemetery even though he did not find it: "On the road between Dry Creek Rd. and 
Enterprise, one mile east of Bethel Church. On the north side of road, behind 
the barn of a place still known as the Old Bumpass place. Evidently there were 
never any of the graves marked with inscribed markers. Only 2 or 3 fieldstone 
are now visible."<br/>
<br/>
Comment by C. Wayne Austin 31 Mar 2011. "That is in conflict with the USGS 
mapping coordinates offered on this site. All descriptions are unreasonable 
including the 1 miles from Dry Creek Road. He also says it is on the north side 
of the road. USGS records are at variance with all that. It has been my 
experience Mr. Fred Hawkins is more correct than the USGS in other searches of 
lost cemeteries I have conducted.</b></p>
