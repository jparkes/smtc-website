<p><b>The above information is taken from They Passed This Way. I could find
no one who could give me information as to the exact location of this graveyard.
Fred Lee Hawkins, 1987.</b><b></br>
I have not yet searched for this place. Judging from where Mr. Fred placed this
cemetery on his mapping I found a very high hill nearby the map location he
pointed out so that I am assuming for the first choice in locating this cemetery
the Hill Family is interred (as often they did) high upon that hilltop. See
topographical &amp; aerial maps. 24
