<p align="center"><b>SOWELL (</b><b>(JOHN</b><b>) CEMETERY, 
south of Sawdust, Morel Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sowell(J)SawdustTopo.jpg" width="645" height="533"></br>
</b>Location: From just east of Sawdust, 
take Morel Road toward Cross Bridges and go 2 &amp; 3/4 miles to large dairy farm 
now owned</br>
by Gary Herrman. The cemetery is on the back side of his place. Plotting this on the map 
is impossible as from mapping here we don't know where the Gary Herrman place is nor are we told 
if it is on the right or left side of Morel Road. After a study of the maps this 
is my best guess of where I would look without assistance. I don't intend 
on going here without asking someone &amp; getting permission. This is the best approach. If you 
have information that can tell us where this cemetery is E-mail me at

It is marked by a red check.</br>

</b>I believe the cemetery can be found within the yellow circle, but maybe not. 
We are looking for what was in 1988 the Gary Herrman Dairy Farm. That area is 
of course
private property.<i> </br>
