</br>
Note by Kathy (Whitaker) Van Leeuan:&nbsp; John Sr. and John Jr. were the son-in-law and
grandson of John and Mary Draper Love. Mary Draper Love was the niece of Mary Draper Ingles of the
&quot;Follow the River&quot; story. Her father Johnny Draper was a spy for the
Patriots in the Revolution, and her mother, Betty Roberton Draper was kidnapped
by Indians along with her sister-in-law Mary D. Ingles.</br>

Love Family Participates In Grave Marking Rites</br>
</br>
Over 30 direct descendants of David Love (1763-1827), Revolutionary soldier,
with their families and friends were present for a grave marking ceremony at
Wilkes Cemetery, Culleoka, TN., April 9.</br>
</br>
The services commemorated the reinterment of six ancestors of the Love Family
with the dedication of three DAR plaques to David Love, Revolutionary soldier;
Mary Draper Love, wife of a Revolutionary soldier, and John Draper Love, son of
a Revolutionary soldier. They were placed by family members representing 12 DAR
and SAR chapters.</br>
</br>
Two more DAR plaques were placed jointly by the Samuel Hammond Chapter DAR,
Kosciusko, and Tenassee Chapter DAR, Maury County, TN, to Mary Draper Love,
daughter of Revolutionary soldier, John Draper and Susannah Caruthers Love, wife
of John Draper Love, daughter of Revolutionary soldier Robert Caruthers.</br>
</br>
A government CSA marker was also dedicated to Colonel Robert Caruthers Love, son
of John Draper and Susannah Caruthers Love, and their daughter, Elizabeth
Patillo Love Zolicofer&nbsp; was among those honored.</br>
</br>
After Newt Love Jr. of Kosciusko, serving as master of ceremonies, welcomed the
group, members of the Samuel Hammond Chapter DAR conducted the first part of the
memorial program. Renda Love Regan of Marietta, GA, led the pledge of allegiance
to the flag of the United States of America, followed by Mary Love of Sallis,
who gave a short biographical sketch of each ancestor, pointing out that two
more of the 13 children of John Draper Love and Susannah Caruthers Love were
also interred in the Wilkes Cemetery, Captain Joseph Love, CSA hero, and Jane
Crockett Love Wilkes.</br>
</br>
A history of the restoration project, which has taken six years to complete, was
presented by Sarah Love Regan of Kosciusko, who expressed appreciation to all
descendants and friends who had cooperated in preserving this legacy and urged
that future projects be considered.</br>
</br>
The DAR grave marking ritual was read by members of the Tenassee Chapter DAR,
Mrs. McBroom Shirley, regent; Mrs. Mary Graham, chaplain; and Mrs. Betty Gibson,
who led the responses. A closing prayer concluded the memorial services, given
by Paul Love, Glen Allan, MS.</br>
</br>
Other Mississippi family members attending were:&nbsp; Mrs. Newt Love Sr., Mrs.
Newt Love Jr., John Clark Love, all from Kosciusko; Mrs. Richard Greenlee of
Jackson; and Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Whitaker of Armory, who brought a quilt which is
over 130 years old, made by Elizabeth Love Whitaker, David Love's daughter and
Whitaker's great-grandmother.</br>

Kathy (Whitaker) Van Leeuwan:</br>
On my visit to Maury Co. last month I tried to find the Griffin - Love cemetery
where my g-g-g-grandfather John Whitaker and his son are buried. The road in
that area crosses a stream (Fountain Creek I suppose), and the bridge is washed
out. It is quite remote and overgrown - there is a farm on one side though. It
did look like a nice spot for a mill, though the brush was too thick to
investigate much. It would be best to go back in the fall or spring with someone
who knows the area.</br>
