</b><b>More research
is perhaps needed. I placed the above red check there on a nearby ledge as a way
of plotting where in olden times the pioneers would place a cemetery. Usually on
a ledge or sometimes all the way to the top of a steep hill. Bill Thrasher did
not offer information here, but there is good reason to believe the Freeland's
would want to be interred on their own land as opposed to the cemetery across
the street which at the time of their deaths may have been very small. </b><b><i>Wayne Austin,
