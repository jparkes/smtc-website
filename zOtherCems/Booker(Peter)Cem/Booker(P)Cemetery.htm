<u><b>Commentary by Fred Lee Hawkins 1987:</b></u>


</p>


<p>

This cemetery was completely destroyed, and stones broken or dislocated, during
the construction of a housing development. In 1986 the City of Columbia sent
workers to repair the damage. They collected all of the stones they could find,
built a small wall and poured a concrete slab. They then placed the stones in
random fashion in the wet cement. It is now like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle
to place the fragments together in correct order. This is not the ideal
solution, but it at least brought a semblance of order out of chaos.&nbsp;

<p align="center"><u><b>Peter Booker</b></u>

</p>


<p>Peter Booker was one of the first settlers in the new country of Maury. He was
selected by the first magistrates to be the solicitor and was one of the men who
ordered a survey to be made of the boundaries of the county in 1807. In 1811 he
served as Captain of one of the companies of militia. In 1820 he was one of the
builders of the first bridge across the Duck River. It is not known whether or
not he was a trained lawyer but he served for a short time as solicitor. His
later life was spent in various business endeavors. He was the father of five
sons and four daughters. He was the owner of a large plantation just south of
Columbia and built a large house, which was burned by Federal troops during the
Civil War. His son, James, was the builder of 'Fairmount', the lovely old
mansion which stands on the east side of Mooresville Pike, just after it crosses
the Lewisburg Pike. Peter Booker died in Somerville, Tenn. in 1839 and it is
thought that he was buried there. The stone in this cemetery, however, might
refute that claim.&nbsp;
