</B><b>&nbsp;Cemetery is located west of Hampshire. Take Dry Fork Road to Whiteside Rd. Turn
south (left) and go about one mile. The cemetery is in bushes on the (right) west
side of road, on
place owned by Mrs. Roy Dycus. (1987).
This map from Topozone is probably accurate. The perimeter placement of
the cemetery is drawn out indicating someone spent the time necessary to get it
correctly placed.</b><B></br>

think the cemetery can be found. If wrong stay tuned as I fix this after an actual
locating of the cemetery. Hopefully the stones are still standing
and can be found.&nbsp; [WA 28 Nov 2008]</br>
