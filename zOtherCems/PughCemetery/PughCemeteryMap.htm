south (left) and go about one mile. The cemetery is in bushes on the (right) west
side of road, on
place owned by Mrs. Roy Dycus. (1987)<FONT  color=#800000 size=2>.
</FONT>This map from Topozone is probably accurate. The perimeter placement of
the cemetery is drawn out indicating someone spent the time necessary to get it
correctly placed.</b></font><B><FONT  color=#800000 size=2><br>

think the cemetery can be found. If wrong stay tuned as I fix this after an actual
locating of the cemetery. Hopefully the stones are still standing
and can be found.&nbsp; [WA 28 Nov 2008]<br>
