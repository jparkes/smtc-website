In this thicket of trees is where I believe the two or three stones in this
cemetery can be located. They are probably to our left up the hill. Scroll around on this
photo and see if you can locate the two small carved stones. Now you know why
March is the best time to look since the trees &amp; brush will be clearer.<br/>

than the photo above. While the brush is less dense and the vision is clearer.
The cemetery is not likely to be here unless the mapping is incorrect. From this
you get a real perspective of the difficulty of finding a lost cemetery.
Especially when there are only two stones involved. [WA 28 Nov 2008]<br/>
