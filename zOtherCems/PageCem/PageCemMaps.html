<p align="center"><b>PAGE CEMETERY</b><b>,
FLY, MAURY, COUNTY TENNESSEE <br/>
<img border="0" height="525" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/PageCemTopo,m,5.jpg" width="699"/><br/>
The Page Cemetery is not located on any mapping that I know of except Mr. Fred
Hawkins was shown the place and detailed it. The yellow area is the closest I can get using his
locators.<br/>

<b> The above yellow spot is on Fly Hollow
Rd and is about a mile north of Fly. When you reach the second sharp bend in the
road (back north) it is about due east of there some distance. <br/>

<b>Again the closest we can get to locating this cemetery is using the mapping
from Cemeteries of Maury County which is not specific. This cemetery will be
very hard to find without someone specifically pointing it out.<br/>
