<p align="center"><b>CRANFORD
CEMETERY, Cranford Hollow Rd., (Eastern) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

This map shows the
GPS coordinates of the Cranford Cemetery. Either this cemetery has been
destroyed or these coordinates are incorrect. I went to the place marked on the
above map and found only a parked bulldozer which had recently razed the hill
side where that spot supposedly marked the cemetery. There was no sign of a
cemetery. I rather think Mr. Fred Hawkins is correct when he says the cemetery
is high upon the slopes of Dean Hill. At the time I did not check that location.
That is located about 700 yards east (or
about 4 tenths of a mile) and to the north a bit. Dense trees are there now, 22
years later, so that cemetery will be very difficult to find unless one is
already familiar with that hill.</b></p><center><b><br/>

Go east on
Cranford Hollow Road to the old Cranford (now Akin Place, 1987). The cemetery is
high up on the slope of Dean Hill in a thicketÂ  marked by medium sized
Cedar Trees. The red check marks my guess.<img border="0" height="431" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CranfordCemAerialMap.jpg" width="1001"/><br/>
This aerial map points to the slope of Dean hill
in an attempt to make a predetermination of where this cemetery might be.

This close up aerial map points to a spot
on Dean Hill which is
darker in color indicating a Cedar tree thicket or tall dense trees, one or the
other. This is definitely a place that needs to be checked out in an attempt to
find this cemetery. One can also see a crooked field road winding up toward the
the top, but on the east slope of the hill. It goes to the saddle (south side) in the hill.
That may have been the original road to the cemetery and is another place to be
checked.
