This is a Road map
that shows the Cemetery location. Go Greens Mill Rd to Jackson Road and turn
north and follow the road about 1/2 mile until the road bends back right. With
permission go east to the grave site back into the bend of the Rutherford Creek
shown above as a blue line. It is on a knoll back in a pasture (1987) but the
knoll is still there. Unless you know the visual signs of a grave site you are
not likely to find this stone if it is still fallen without aid from the locals.<br/>

I think this stone is located in the tree line on this aerial image,Â 
but I am not certain of this. It is shown with the yellow arrow pointer. That is
just the first place I will look if I visit here and do not have help from
a local person who knows the location of this stone. The GPS locator map above
shows the cemetery slightly northeast of this pointer in the open field.<br/>
