Tombstone probably set by John Fly, 1802 -1884</br>
long after the death of his 
mother because the style &amp; type of stone is not consistent with the 1808 era.</br>
&nbsp;<span style="color: #000088; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><b>FLY, Sarah, 1767 - 1808, &quot;Mother of John Fly&quot;. This 
is possibly the first death in Maury County that is inscribed on a tombstone. 
However we believe it was set in place much later by her son John Fly. It is not 
of the style of stone set in 1808, but of a style that was used mostly between 
1870 &amp; 1900.)</br>
