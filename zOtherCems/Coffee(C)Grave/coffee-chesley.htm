<font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font size="2">COFFEE, Chesley, Born November 19 1755 &amp; Died September 18,
1818 He came from North&nbsp;Carolina via in what is now Loudon Co., Tn then on 
to Kentucky before moving to Maury Co., TN. His Father was believed to be Chesley Coffee, Sr. 
<br>
COFFEE, Margaret [Baldwin] abt 1760 - 1825. (wife of Chesley Coffee) She w</font></b></font><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#800000" size="2">as 
in the over 45 (b. before 1765) category in the 1810 census of Kentucky living 
with her husband Chesley. I believe she was younger than Chesley though, so born 
about 1760 . She was still maintaining the household as Margaret Coffee in Maury 
County during 1820, but does not show up in the 1830 census so I have averaged 
her death date to 1825, though it was between 1820 and 1830. This will be used 
until the perfect truth shows up, if ever.<br>
</font><font size="2" color="#000080">Also if she were in her husband's 
household before his death I must assume she was buried beside him, because 
there were just a few years between their death dates if the census is correct. 
However, it is possible she is interred in the Reese's Chapel Cemetery near her 
eldest son Nathan a few miles to the northeast of here. Reese's </font>
</font>
<font size="2"><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS">was an active cemetery 
in her time. Of course there are some risk these dates are far off but I think 
less than 10% chance. For instance if there were two Margaret Coffee's in Maury 
Co in 1820 over 45 and one was missed this could be false info. That is a remote 
possibility though.<br>
<br>
When
Photographed&nbsp;the inscription was not there and it was apparent the top face of the stone had
fractured
away. I could not locate any parts on the ground that contained the lettering. A
large
stump on our left from a dead tree once violated the stone but has long since
died.&nbsp;It is now rotting away and no longer appears to threaten the stone. </font>

<font size="2"><i>The photo above is a 1996 low resolution video capture by C. Wayne Austin. Since the
inscription has weathered away we are using the inscription from They Passed
This Way translated about 1963 and or Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries by Fred
Hawkins agreeing with that. Our reasons for thinking this is the Chesley Coffee 
Stone is the location mapping verification is close by but I think not exact. 
Also the age of the stone tells me the style of stone was set prior to 1830.</i></font></b></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">
