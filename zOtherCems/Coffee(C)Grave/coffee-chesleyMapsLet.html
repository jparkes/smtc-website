</b>The above markings on this map are the places needed
to look to find this cemetery. The first mark is a red cross at the upper left
corner of the map. That is the location that USGS maps say the cemetery is 
located at 35 Degrees 28.12' North by 87 Degrees 9.43' West. That is not exactly 
where I found this stone in 1996. It was further south along a ledge that runs
above the level of the land below where the creek runs north/south. I believe this
ledge does not span true north/south but slants in a northwest direction. I 
placed yellow pointers on this map indicating places along that ledge in an 
attempt to precisely map the location. If the terrain
is still as it was in 1996 the stone could be found under one of the tips of
those yellow arrows. I have marked off the driveway Address as #1828 where I
believe the best prospects are for relocating this grave and show with the green
arrow where I think the grave will be found. When I was there in 1996 there were
no trees lining the Scotts Creek as the above map shows. </br>
I am not accusing
these people of destroying my ancestors grave but it sure has that appearance. I
would love for them to come forward and prove to me that the Chesley Coffee
Gravestone was not destroyed by their bulldozers and in fact is still there. Under the
new laws of Tennessee I cannot be denied a visit, but I was because of mean dogs 
and silent people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
It is time to inject the difficulty and confusion of finding a lost
graveyard even the third time after going there twice before. That is even after making 
a video and
showing a photo here of the grave stone on this site. I went there originally
about 1994 and was taken to the little stone beside the decaying Maple Tree
stump by the land owner. That was before any houses were in this area except 
farm houses. At that
time there was only the owners house down the road. I went back later with my
sister Joyce and showed her the place and I went directly there and made a movie of
the stone with a Cam Corder. That was back in 1996 or 1995. Several years later or
about 9 years later I went back and tried to tie the details down with modern
GPS mapping relating to any land improvement changes.&nbsp; This to tie the 
location down in a way that could never be refuted again. What I found was shocking to my
efforts to locate the little stone. Trailers had spring up all along that road in
the area in front of the ledge that contained the graveyard. Since the terrain
had changed I could no longer be certain of the exact grave location. I went
back even later again thru there and found that a bulldozer had cleared a long place
along the ledge in back of the trailer. To the best of my judgment that ledge
contained the graveyard. The grave was up the ledge and back on the plateau about 50
more feet from the edge of the ledge. </br>
When I drove into the lane of the trailer
home to ask the owner about all this several vicious dogs met me and set up
territorial yapping. I never trust a dog that looks like a Pit Bull dog.&nbsp; I parked there in the driveway a moment and no one came to
the door. Being a polite southerner I did not blow my horn because of the
possibility of awaking someone who was a night shift worker nor did I want to
risk having to assault the seemingly vicious dogs, so I left with no conclusion.

This map shows the area where I found that tombstone in 1994 and again in 1996. 
As I recall looking at this map I walked from Terrapin Branch Road (due west) 
down to the creek and the creek was not immediately next to the road. So maybe 
that was a hundred feet or more from the road to the Scotts Creek. After 
crossing I traveled across a field and came to the ledge. I estimated in the 
distance from the creek to the tree-line &amp; embankment as 50 yards. After 
climbing the embankment to the plateau (probably 30 feet high)&nbsp; I traveled 
again in the woods some distance (maybe 80') before seeing the stone and at that 
time a rotting maple stump on its left.</br>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000066">I have been 
told that was the old Tillman Knox place and though the road name I have is 
Terrapin Branch Road that road name doubles as the Screamer Road. It terminates 
on Hwy 166 at Screamer and begins just south of Scotts Mill at Southport Road 
and runs by that Chesley Coffee grave about half way down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000066">I would be 
delighted to meet you folks in another attempt to locate that grave. Maybe 
something has changed with the dogs or other that allows a better look today. 
Everyone wants to go there in the summer, but it is much better to go in the 
winter when the chiggers, Poison Ivy &amp; snakes are gone. However, I have finally 
found a solution for those pest. I wear knee high top rubber boots and that 
eliminates the chiggers and snakes and even the poison Ivy if I don't bend over 
and touch the stuff. The chiggers that find their way higher are rare and snakes 
never bite higher than the knees. With all the increasing rain in recent years 
poison Ivy is as bad as I have ever seen it here. We need a six months drought 
to kill the stuff back. Instead all we get is more rain every few days which has 
something green covering every spot not mowed and that kills the visibility for 
finding lost gravestones. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000066">If my 
suspicions are correct we will need money to add a stone somewhere nearby 
because I think that grave has been destroyed. Maybe we could add it to the 
Ebenezer Cemetery north of there a mile +.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000066">I also 
remember you rightly questioned if my placement and photos were that for the 
Chesley's grave. I cannot offer absolute proof since there was no inscription 
remaining, but many bits of evidence do add up which I won't detail again here. 
One though was that I remember asking the gentleman to take me to the Chesley 
Coffee Grave stone and he did as was in his mind. That place was already based 
on other's directions to the location who had connections to the past which I 
was following that day. It was such a brush thicket initially I had a hard time 
finding it by myself. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000066">The Maury Co 
Archives has that GPS on file as the Chesley Coffee Graves. Also Mr. Fred 
Hawkins gave explicit directions that match the location I am referring to. Also 
other maps in the past has placed the grave location. There were some other&nbsp; lost 
graves in that area that I found and quickly marked, &nbsp;so I don't believe there 
are any others now since I have tromped around in that area several times in the 
winter when one can see 150 yards before bushes blanks out the vision. I also 
had many on-line discussions with Mr Douglas Baker who grew up on that road and lives here in 
Huntsville. We had many E-mail exchanges about all the lost graves in that area. 
He grew up rural (like me) and knew every rock &amp; cranny for five miles within 
his home as a teenager. </br>

1982 letter from Bob Hackney about the connections of other 
coffee kin in that area to Chesley Coffee's.&nbsp;</span></p>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">R. L. Hackney</br>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Dear Mr. 
Coffey</br>
Thank you so much for your recent letter and the information in it. It was 
thoughtful of you to take the time to reply so</br>
promptly and with all the charts. I was specially glad to get the explanation of 
the change in the spelling of the surname.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">It appear 
that we're related -- see the enclosed &quot;relationship finder.&quot; That's on the 
assumption that I am correct in thinking</br>
that Calvin was Nathan Coffee's son. He (Calvin was mentioned in Nathan Coffee's 
will as a son.&nbsp; The will was dated 5 Aug 1856 and</br>
was proved July 1858&nbsp; see Will Book F, Vol 1, page 147-149 Maury </span>
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
 font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Co.</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">, TN.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Further, 
Calvin Coffee's will -- dated 10 Mar 1886 and recoded in Will Book G, pages 
249-252 -- mentioned: William F. Coffey, a</br>
grandson and son of Isaac H. Coffey; Wm F. Coffey, a deceased son's widow and 
children; Nancy L. Douglas, a daughter; Catherine</br>
C. Wilcoxson, a deceased daughter's children; Wm W. Coffey, a brother and 
William Nathan Wilcoxson, another grandson.</br>
Isaac H. Coffee's will, recorded in WB F, Vol. 1, page 336, refers to Calvin 
Coffee as his father and Emily Coffee as his wife.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">It would seem 
logical that this is the same man shown on your sister's pedigree chart as Maj. 
I. Hamilton Coffee. </br>
I found the will of an Emily F. Coffee, probated 22 Sep 1874 in Giles County, 
that named a son William F. Coffee and requested </br>
that he be put under the personal care and management of her mother, Manerva A. 
West. Also, that her brother, Homer R. West, be</br>
her son's guardian. So, it looks as if this William F. could be the one and same 
as the William Finis Coffee (1868-1954.) shown</br>
on the chart.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Courier New; background: yellow">
While in Maury Co. early this fall I also ran onto a record of a Chesley Coffey 
(1755-1818) who is buried on the Tillman Knox property, on Screamer Road. His 
wife's name was Margaret - see WB C-1, page 341. It appears that he was Nathan 
Coffee's father as both Nathan and Margaret were appointed administrators of his 
will- see Minute Record, Book 5, page 274. Admittedly, this is not proof but it 
seems very logical.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">You didn't 
ask for all of this information in return and may already have it, but, if 
you're interested, there it is. Thank </span>
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Courier New">you</br>
again for your help.</span></p>
