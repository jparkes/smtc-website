This photo shows our subject toppled stone. The main base lies pushed up by the
giant Cedar disrupting the balance of the memorial causing the parts to fall in
different directions. A smaller base lies under the main part of the stone that
carries the inscription. Another part of the base lies over left behind that
scrub tree. I was able to raise the stone up a bit out of the soil but not enough
to conclude whether or not there was other inscriptions on the back side.&nbsp;</br>

<i>The style of memorial lends credence to the death date
of 1893. It looks like the &quot;9&quot; in 1893 is facing backwards but not
flipped as a &quot;6&quot; would be. Believe previous publishers and researchers
miss-read this death date as 1863.</i></br>

<i>This larger view might help clear this up for some
folks. You can make your own decision, but to me most of the evidence says this
death date is 1893, not 1863. Not only is this style memorial an 1890s memorial
the displayed age is 62&nbsp; years or 1831 to 1893 = 62 years of age. The
&quot;9&quot; character looks like an upside down &quot;6&quot; and that is
closer to a &quot;9&quot; than a &quot;6&quot;. All the hard heads convinced?
One thing making this difficult is the wet stone.</br>

I tried to turn this memorial over, but due to its weight (and my age) I failed.
I think it plausible the inscription for R. S. Foster to be on the other side. I
must add though no previous researcher has detailed that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
