<p align="center"><b>FOSTER (Richard) CEMETERY,&nbsp;Smiser-Hickman
Rd, Stiversville, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</b>

<b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/FosterTopozone.jpg" width="433" height="363"></br>
This is the map which I believe to be accurate. It was not available to me when I
first looked for this cemetery in 2005.&nbsp;</br>

MS Streets &amp; Trips version of the cemetery location showing the cemetery about
50 yards off of Smiser Hickman Road. That is inaccurate. This error is not inherent
in MS Streets, but also is misplaced in Delorme Mapping. The cemetery is just off
of the right-of-way. Some of it is across the fence on the road bank and some of
it lies 30 feet further north of that under an old cedar beside the fence row
next to the house lot line.

<b>This U.S.G.S. map shows where the
cemetery is located in relation to Stiversville. It is marked with the
words CEM and a tiny rectangular outline of the area of land this cemetery occupies. The basis of this map was developed in the 1940s or early
1950s by USGS and updated by TVA later.</b></br>

This aerial view shows the place where this cemetery can be found marked with a red
cross. I am placing the mapping coordinate approximately in
the place
where the 1950s map makers say the cemetery was located.&nbsp;
