This view of the Richard &amp; Elizabeth Foster memorial shows the different
tumbled parts. I just imagine the stone was so close to the edge of the road at
one time that it tumbled into the ditch beside the road and all the parts were
later dragged back upon the bank by some thinking &amp; caring soul. There are
some old scattered trash piled here so don't be confused by that.&nbsp;<br>

Richard Foster memorial. This inscription has not been found by any previous
researchers because it was face down for many years and the stone is too heavy
to turn over. The inscription for his wife Elizabeth is face down now and
unreadable but was transcribed by Mr. Fred Hawkins in 1987.</b></font><font size="2"><b><br>

commissioned an ensign in 1814, and was the son of George and Sara Wilkes
Foster.&nbsp;<br>
Inscription: RICHARD FOSTER | Born Dec 25th 1785. | Died Feb 1st 1868 | Age 83

<i>It is likely the death date reads 1785 but not certain. If one compares the
five in 25 to this character it is very close. Dates on above do not calculate
to 83 years, 1 month and 5 days.<br>

<i>The inscription for Elizabeth lies on&nbsp; the other side of this large
mid-section of this multipart memorial that is tumbled and face down on her
name. It weighs about 1/4 of a ton and I could rock it a bit, but not turn it
over.</i><br>
