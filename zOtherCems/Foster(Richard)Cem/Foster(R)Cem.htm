<p align="center"><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>FOSTER (Richard) CEMETERY,&nbsp;Smiser-Hickman
Rd, Stiversville, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE
</b>
</font>
<p><font size="2"><b>From Stiversville, go north on Pulaski Pike 1/4 mile and
turn (left) west on Smiser-Hickman Road. The cemetery is on the bank of the road
behind the first house on right. (1988)&nbsp;Nothing like that today. The cemetery is
closer to &quot;beside a house than behind a house on the bank&quot;. That is
because a house was built beside the cemetery since 1988.&nbsp; The house that
the cemetery is behind is further down the road east and facing Hwy 31.&nbsp;<br>
Todays instructions would be to go south on Pulaski Pike about 10 miles and turn
right or west on Smiser -Hickman Road. Go about 500 yards and the cemetery is
found on the road bank on the right just before one reaches the last house in
the corner of the road on the right before the road bends right. The cemetery is
in the thicket there. All the memorials are fallen so nothing can be seen from
the road. I could not tell for sure but there was the presence of only two
complete memorials, fallen, and the pieces scattered around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font>

<b><font size="2">1988 commentary:<br>
&quot;This cemetery is about ready to erode and fall into the
ditch caused by the grading of the road. There are several
graves marked by fieldstones.&quot;<br>
2005/2009 commentary:<br>
I did not find this graveyard in 2005 but was focused on the area 50 yards (due
to Delorme Mapping error) north of the
road. Nothing there. [WA 19 Dec 2005, compiled 26 Jan 2009] Update 28 Feb 2009.
I went back and found it the second time around. Because all the stones are
lying on the ground the cemetery is hard to see.&nbsp;
