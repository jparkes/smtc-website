<p align="center">MOORE CEMETERY, CULLEOKA TENNESSEE</p>
<p align="center"><b>From Culleoka go west on Mooresville Pike to Frank Moore Road. Turn
right or north and
go 1/2 mile to old Moore place. The
house is a lovely log house that has been restored. The cemetery is on the
hillside, to the right of house, in a clump
of trees surrounded by a rock wall that is in a declining state.<br/>

The Moore Cemetery behind the rock wall as photographed on 30 Dec 2005.<br/>

There is a box tomb but the top is gone. All but one of the others are also box tombs
and the tops are crumbling and it is very difficult to read them. The rock wall that
once enclosed this cemetery is falling down. The stones that form that are
scattered around leaving a cluttered look. This cemetery is as near
completely destroyed as any I have seen. NLVNCPA, stands for Neglect, Livestock,
Vandals, Natural Causes, &amp; Public Apathy, the cause of this.
