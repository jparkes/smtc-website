MOORE, Nath. T., 13 Dec 1806 - 30 Sep 1887.&nbsp;</br>
MOORE, Eliza, 23 Dec 1810 - 13 Jun 1839. (28-06-20.) &quot;Wife of Nath T.
Moore.&quot;</br>
Nathaniel Moore was an early circuit rider for the Methodist Church. He was
about the right age to have served a role in the merger of the Pleasant Garden
&amp; Shane Churches in 1836 1/4 mile That church stood to the west of this cemetery near the
Wilkes-Campground Cemetery. It is also believed the Antebellum Home near here
was built or had built by Nath. I have not proven that but it deserves further
investigation. In the old days it was common when one died to be buried on a
selected site on ones property and especially if there was a significant home
&amp; property involved. That was usually in the high ground away from flooding.</br>
