<br/>
F.L.H initials for researcher &amp; author Fred Lee Hawkins Jr. who last visited this 
cemetery for cataloguing inscriptions on 27 Feb <br/>
1986. I know of no credible author who has been here since.   <br/>
Wilburn Leonard Potts that lives in Santa Fe, Maury County, (a 94 years old 
Potts family historian) said in 2006 one would need a bull dozer to get to this 
cemetery today. How sad. [W.A. per Cherl Wilson via M.B.M. Sep 2010]<br/>
<br/>
<b>(1)</b> 
Fred Hawkins further states that the only readable monuments were a Undertakers 
Marker for Columbus M. Potts*<br/>
<b>(2)</b> Initials M.P. for Martha Potts known to be the wife of John Potts 
inscribed on a fieldstone.<br/>
<br/>
Fred Hawkins further states in 1986 that one aluminum Slab was used as a marker, but contained no 
inscription. All other death listings above were <br/>
provided to Mr Fred by Mrs Rubye Tatum and other Potts descendents, with the 
exception of the news article from the Daily Herald listing the death of John 
"Jackie" Potts who was killed by W.T. Lane. I do not know if this is the same 
Jackie Potts who according to records above died in 1917.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Fred Hawkins published all this information in the book "Maury County 
Tennessee Cemeteries". That book is available for sale on the Maury County 
Tennessee Historical Society Web site.<br/>
