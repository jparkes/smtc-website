<br>
F.L.H initials for researcher &amp; author Fred Lee Hawkins Jr. who last visited this 
cemetery for cataloguing inscriptions on 27 Feb <br>
1986. I know of no credible author who has been here since.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Wilburn Leonard Potts that lives in Santa Fe, Maury County, (a 94 years old 
Potts family historian) said in 2006 one would need a bull dozer to get to this 
cemetery today. How sad. [W.A. per Cherl Wilson via M.B.M. Sep 2010]<br>
<br>
<b>(1)</b> 
Fred Hawkins further states that the only readable monuments were a Undertakers 
Marker for Columbus M. Potts*<br>
<b>(2)</b> Initials M.P. for Martha Potts known to be the wife of John Potts 
inscribed on a fieldstone.<br>
<br>
Fred Hawkins further states in 1986 that one aluminum Slab was used as a marker, but contained no 
inscription. All other death listings above were <br>
provided to Mr Fred by Mrs Rubye Tatum and other Potts descendents, with the 
exception of the news article from the Daily Herald listing the death of John 
&quot;Jackie&quot; Potts who was killed by W.T. Lane. I do not know if this is the same 
Jackie Potts who according to records above died in 1917.<br>
<br>
Mr. Fred Hawkins published all this information in the book &quot;Maury County 
Tennessee Cemeteries&quot;. That book is available for sale on the Maury County 
Tennessee Historical Society Web site.<br>
