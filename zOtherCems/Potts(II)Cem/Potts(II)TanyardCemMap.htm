This modified Topozone map shows the GPS Lat. and Long. coordinates. Based on 
the directions of Mr. Fred Hawkins, 1986. All this is my best guess.</br>

Instructions 1986. In Kinderhook go out Gordon Lawrence Road for 1.5 miles to 
edge of Beard Farms. The cemetery is in the woods on the right about 100 yards 
up the hill. (I think this means up the hill 100 yards from the road, 2010) It 
is across the road from the old Tanyard. </br>

This aerial view tells the truth about where the woods and roads are located in 
the quest to find this old cemetery.</br>

The yellow pointers point to the spots most likely one would find a lost 
cemetery that is in the woods.</b><i><b> </i> Without this 
cemetery being marked on a map it is a good chance this cemetery has been 
bulldozed, especially in light of the fact there was no formal monuments.<i></br>
