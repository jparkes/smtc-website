CEMETERY-MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</br>
</b></font></p>

<div align="left">
  <p align="center"><b>This
  cemetery is located on the private property of Norman Wayne Davis, who lives
  on the northern edge of the Sandy Hook community. From Mount Pleasant, go
  south on Highway 43 (New Lawrenceburg Highway), take the turnoff from Highway
  43 left onto the Old Lawrenceburg Highway. Just after rounding the curve, take
  your first right. Mr. Davis lives in the second house on the right. It has
  been awhile since I visited this cemetery so I cannot really give directions
  to it from his home. I am sure that he could give further directions. I
  visited the cemetery years ago hoping to possibly find the grave of my
  great-great-grandfather Andrew Kennedy who lived in the area. It was a long
  shot, but as many of you know, you take the long shots when you cannot find
  what you are looking for.</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><b>As
  far as I know this is a 100% listing of the known graves in the cemetery. The
  cemetery can be found transcribed on page 788 of Maury County, Tennessee
  Cemeteries and page A-50 of They Passed This Way.</b></font></p>
