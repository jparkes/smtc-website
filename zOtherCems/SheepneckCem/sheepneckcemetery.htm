</font><font ><font color="#000080" size="2">Sheepneck Cemetery was once
the main burial ground for the area around Sandy Hook in Maury County,
Tennessee. Other than a few family burial grounds the majority of people from
that area were buried here. I am not sure when burials were ceased here but I do
know that the cemetery was eventually abandoned. There were not very many
burials after Arlington Cemetery opened in 1909. The last known burial was the
burial of Donna Fay Brannon who was interred here in 1940 and her grave was
marked. There are numerous burials here but most of them are only marked by
fieldstones. My great-grandmother, Mary Lindsey Brown, used to visit the
cemetery and tend to the unmarked graves of her sister and a niece. I do
not know who this sister or niece was at this point but they may have died as
infants. She told sometime before she died
that the graves used to have fences around them and she always kept fresh
flowers on them. Over the years, the cemetery became completely abandoned and as
far as I know the cemetery has not been entered since Fred Hawkins surveyed it
on 26 Feb 1988. I have been to the area several times but even in the winter the
woods are so thick that I was not able to enter. The cemetery is located off
Sheepneck Road on the left in a thicket beside the Orrï¿½s Chapel Cemetery, a
black cemetery that is still in use today.<br>

Note: Perrin's 3rd wife (between Martha and Aunt Adeline) was named Priscilla.
They weren't married long before she died. No one has found a burial place for
her but she may have been buried at Sheepneck. The family lived in that area and
it was the most likely burial spot. If she were buried here the listing would
look like this:&nbsp;<br>
