<p align="center"><b>BLACKBURN GRAVES,&nbsp;Lasea
Rd, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE

</b>
<p align="center"><b>From Columbia go out Bear Creek Pike 6 and 6
tenths of a mile and turn north on Lasea Rd and go 287 yards or .16 tenths of a
mile and look to your left on the bank of the road under a Cedar. There will see
the single footstone standing. The stone is about 15 to 20 yards due west from the
center of the Lasea Rd. The headstone is on the ground lying on the grave, but the
footstone is the same size and standing. The cemetery is currently being
maintained as a part of a extended lawn. Mr. Fred Hawkins said this was the
Collins Home in 1986.</br>

BLACKBURN, William</a>, 4 Oct 1772 - 14 May 1856.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>There evidently was fieldstones here marking graves in past times. Mention was made of that
previously but no sign of them today. It is possible they were removed to make
way for mowing the area or they might just have sunken into the ground. These
along with other less apt possibilities exist as to why there are no fieldstones
here in 2009.</br>
