<P align=center><B>BILLS FAMILY
CEMETERY, MOORESVILLE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</B>
</P>
<p align="center"><b>This cemetery has been removed to the Rose Hill Cemetery though I have not as yet
verified that. For now I offer very general directions: The cemetery is/was
located out Mooreville Pike about three miles on the right.&nbsp;</br>
Mr Fred Hawkins offers this instruction in 1987: Go south on Mooresville Pike
from Highway 50 three miles. The cemetery is on the right side of the road
beside a barn on the
A.T. Hill place. However, I am sure it is not the A.T. Hill place today nor do I
believe the barn to be still standing.</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><a href="BillsCemMap.htm"></br>

This is a very old cemetery with several box tombs &amp; I just imagine in the
outlining areas unmarked slave graves. I would hope complete consideration for that
along with other unmarked graves would have occurred. [Wayne Austin 5 Jan 09]. 
It is likely if there were unmarked graves that those could have been considered 
in this moved</b></p>

I am a 5th generation from Daniel Bills. The information of the Bills Cemetery 
being removed to Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee is correct documents 
and today can be researched at Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral Home, West 7th Street, 
Columbia, TN 38401. When Mr. Kelly Greene purchased the Bills' Place (from 1797 
to abt 1807) around 1997, Mr. Frank Sowell of the Funeral Home actually 
supervised the remove of the six (6) graves seven (7) bodies to Rose Hill 
Cemetery.</br>
The burial plot (Bills Cemetery) on Mooresville Pike was enclosed by a circular 
planting of Trees. As of 2007 these trees could be seen from Mooresville's Pike 
but as of today (Oct. 2011) bushes and trees have grown up at the road side 
preventing viewing.</br>
</br>
The Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral home will be able to tell us the lot and location of 
the new graves in Rose Hill. The grave slabs were also carefully moved to the 
new grave lots at Rose Hill Cemetery. Mr. Sowell also stated that the caskets 
were in remarkable condition. Mr. Frank Sowell has now passed away but his son 
Mr. Tony Sowell should be able to help us.</br>
</br>
Daniel Bills (1740-1829) and his wife Deborah Bills (1745-1819) are buried in 
the Houston Cemetery in nearby Marshall County. This is about 1 mile off of 
Interstate 65 at exit 32. I have not been there, a neighbor of the cemetery told 
me is it very grown up as of (2005). To get to that cemetery take exit 32 from 
I-65 and go east toward Lewisburg. However almost immediately turn back south or 
right onto Globe Road and go about a mile and the cemetery will be out in a 
field between the road and the creek with the noise from I-65 heard further west 
across from the creek.</br>
</br>
Hope this helps, if there is any more information that I can help with let me 
know.</br>

Wayne,</br>
I did speak to one of the Sowells today [owners of Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral Home] 
she said she was there when the Bills Cemetery was uncovered and removed to Rose 
Hill. Everyone was very impressed. The actual caskets were not made of wood, but 
some type of cast iron.</br>
Something else amazing...a viewing glass opening about the head area. A lot of 
history people around here went to view the caskets.. - all were astonished. As 
I also said before all graves had &quot;grave slabs&quot; which were engraved instead of 
headstones. Mr. Frank Sowell had Mr. Kelly Greene [new property owner of Bills 
Cemetery Land] purchase vaults for the caskets and a nice head stone for the 
combination of graves. One more note: Frank Sowell tried with all his might to 
convince Kelly Greene to leave the BILLS Cemetery intact because of its history, 
but to no avail. Yes I will gather the information, dates, new lot #'s, notes 
and any pictures if there is any.</br>
</br>
It may take me a while I'm in the middle of my Wallace Family research.</br>
</br>
I have information on the Bills back to 1516.</br>
