<font size="2" color="#800080"><b>A Heritage Book is being assembled for
Marshall County and Virginia Dugger Tyree asked me to write a short article on
the Bills family for the Book. I told her that I'd be glad to write on that
subject if I knew anything to write. She knew that the Bills family was in my
mother's family line but I didn't. I found out that I had a rather large file on
the Bills family in my file cabinet. In fact I had the family history clear back
to Plymouth, Mass.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800080"><b>I suppose they came over on the Mayflower
or a similar boat. Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith's second wife was a Matthews who
was the daughter of the Bills family and she was the mother of my grandfather,
Albert Newton Smith. So, I do have a family connection to the Bills
family.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800080"><b>From all appearances, the Bills family was
quite affluent with large land holdings and a number of slaves to cultivate the
land. They were originally Quakers probably from Pennsylvania but were
&quot;dismissed&quot; from that organization because they strongly favored
America during the Revolutionary War. Quakers were supposed to be opposed to
wars. They moved to North Carolina and became Presbyterians and later were
taught the truth according to the Bible by members of the Christian Church. They
were baptized in the spring branch on the farm there. I knew that they became
Christians, but I did not know the details of their history. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">If
I remember correctly the Bills Cemetery where most of them were buried was moved
to Rose Hill in Columbia by a man who bought the farm. The older Bills were
buried in the Houston cemetery near Lewisburg. </span>I've heard of that
cemetery, but never saw it, nor, the Bills cemetery near Mooresville Pike. <br>

help clarify (moved to Rosehill Cem) why I could not find the Bills Cemetery on
the Mooresville Pike the other day.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" color="#800080"><b>Wayne, I did not find Bills Cemetery either
listed in Rose Hill in Mr. Fred Hawkins book. I do not know just when the moving
of the old Bills Cemetery took place. That event may have happened after 1987
when Fred published his book leaving us with no tombstone records. All the
records that I have concerning that family show a note that the cemetery was
moved to Rose Hill by somebody who bought the old family house and land. I found
a note in some records from Vinton Morgan, son-in-law of my first cousin Melvin
Dugger, that said his wife Peggy was the only person who protested the move. I
do not remember ever personally seeing the cemetery nor the old home, although I
often visited my mother's sister and her husband who lived on a farm located on
the Northwest side of Mooresville Pike at Phiny Murphy road. In fact, I never
heard of any relationship to the Bills family until much later in my life. I
must have passed the old Bills home many times because I used to ride my bicycle
out to the Rheas, (above) from Columbia but I never heard anything about the
Bills family at that time.</b></font></p>
