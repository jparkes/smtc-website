<p align="center"><b>BILLS FAMILY
CEMETERY, MOORESVILLE PIKE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
</b><b><img border="0" height="365" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/BillsCemtopozone.jpg" width="441"/><br/>
This map from TopoZone shows where the cemetery was located at one time along
Mooresville Pike a couple of miles southeast of Columbia before it was 
moved. The east/west road beside Ephesus Church of Christ is the Murphy Lane
west and the Voss Rd going east. This is of importance to anyone who may 
want to know where this Bills family lived. <br/>

did not plot the spot on this map because the cemetery has been moved and the
property accredited as now exclusively private land I did not want to be showing 
private land when an individual spent all that money to move the cemetery to 
Rose Hill. However, we are still interested in this fact since the Bills descendents
want to know where their ancestors lived, died and were interred before any
removal. <br/>
The Delorme GPS I use steered me to a spot just north of the "M" for </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Mooresville
Pike. That is where the photos on this site were made in that small clump of
trees near the road. Some maps seem to be pointing to a place further north to
about the beginning of the line (or hedgerow) of the dense forest shown on the
above aerial view as dark green. The east/west hedgerow is probably a very old
property line between two owners. It extends across Mooresville Pike indicating
its age.<br/>
