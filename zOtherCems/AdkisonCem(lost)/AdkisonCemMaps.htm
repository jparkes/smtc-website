<b>The Adkison Cemetery is supposed
to be as a crow flies .28 a mile from the junction of Blue Springs Road and
Groveland Ridge Road. Otherwise to go there from this same intersection go .30
or 1584 feet or 528 yards out Groveland Ridge Road. Standing on that distance or
spot look left 90<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">�
</span>and the cemetery should be 300 feet or 100 yards from the center of the
road up the slope. Since there are houses all around the selected location may
be in the middle of someone foundation. If so either the mapping is wrong or the
cemetery was truly destroyed. The USGS mapping coordinates are about Latitude
N35<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">�</span>
33' 41.2&quot; &amp; Longitude W86<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">�
</span>57' 19.8&quot;. That is according to the Delorme Mapping location of the
cemetery. Micro-Soft Streets &amp; Trips, Version 2004 says the location is:
35.56253 degrees north and 86.95476 degrees west. That is a slight variation
from the Delorme (conversions needed to 60 degrees), but pinpointing the places
is inexact using the approach I must take.</b></br>

This aerial view shows the place I believe this cemetery might be found if it
still exist. Mr. Fred of course says it was destroyed when the compilers of the
book &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; in 1963 looked for it. From what I have
seen in this old world it is always possible that they are wrong and this
cemetery can still be found. No one has offered absolute proof of the
destruction of this cemetery. Until then I believe we should keep an open
mind. Finding these old small family cemeteries is a challenge anyway,
especially if one is
not familiar with the specific lay of the land. <a href="../../AndrewsCemetery/Andrews03.htm"></br>
