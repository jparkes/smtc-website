Mr. Fred says this in 1988:</u></br>
This cemetery has been completely destroyed and there is no
visible evidence of its whereabouts. In fact, it had already been destroyed in
1963. When this compiler looked for it on 1 Mar 1988, a bulldozer was parked
nearby after having cleared the area, possibly for building purposes.&nbsp;</br>
<u></br>
Commentary 2009:</u></br>
That is pretty strong evidence that this cemetery was destroyed, but I do believe
there is enough wiggle room to keep an open mind for any future
findings.&nbsp;Our sole purpose by
presenting these records here is to enhance the chances this cemetery can be
found if is still exist in any form.</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
</b></p>
<p><b>The compilers of &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; in 1963
mentions this cemetery as one they found on maps, but did not find any stones.
They also mention two other cemeteries with the same condition as being the Harris Cemetery, 1 mile west
of here at about the mouth of Fountain Creek, on the west side of and the Howard
Cemetery,&nbsp; &amp; just south of the Howard Bridge Road, whereby they found no stones.
However, on my visit I found fieldstones in that cemetery.&nbsp;</br>
 Many of these places are such
dense thickets they would need cleaning just to see if there are fallen stones sunken below the soil surface. Having archeology experience in my youthful
background makes me a bit more aggressive towards finding these memorials than
perhaps past researchers. However, we have more hurdles to surmount in our
efforts to find lost
cemeteries than those in the past due to the passage of time.&nbsp;</br>
 Blue Springs Road has no bridge over the Silver Creek or
Fountain Creek anymore. My brief attempt to make an assessment of the Harris
Cemetery condition failed. The bluffs are quite high and the creeks are too deep
around there and one cannot
scale or cross them without being a mountain climber/duck.&nbsp;</br>
&nbsp;
</br>
No one offered a listing as to who was interred here but the surname was
probably Adkison. Other spellings of this surname can be Atkinson or Adkisson.</b></p>
