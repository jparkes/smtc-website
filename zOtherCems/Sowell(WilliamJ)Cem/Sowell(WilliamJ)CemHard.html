<center><b>SOWELL (WILLIAM J.) CEMETERY, 
(Sowell Bend of Duck River-east Maury County), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
Ira Hardison<br/>
<br/>
</b>Ira Hardison was born in North Carolina, 12 May 1806, and came to Tennessee 
between the 
ages of 16 and 18 years. He probably came with his father, Edward Hardison, who 
followed his brothers James, Mark &amp; Joshua to Maury County. In 1828 Ira married a 
cousin, Penelope Hardison, and they had one daughter, Emily J. Hardison who became the 
wife of William J. Sowell. It is believed that Ira first settled on Flat Creek, but 
later purchased a place south of the Duck River, near Leftwich. In 1861 Penelope 
died and the following year Ira married Mary Gullett Franks. They were parents 
to five children. Mr. Hardison died on 30 Sep 1875.<br/>
