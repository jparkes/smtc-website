(Sowell Bend of Duck River-east Maury County), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
William J. Sowell<br>
<br>
</b>William J. Sowell&nbsp; was born 21 Jul 1824 near Willamsport in the western 
part of Maury County. He was the son of William J. 
Sowell, Sr. He acquired a farm in the Rally Hill area, married Emily J. Hardison 
on 8 May 1850. Emily J. was the daughter of Ira &amp; Penelope Hardison. William &amp; 
Emily proceeded to produce a family of ten children. In 1855 he 
moved to a bend on the south side of Duck River in the Leftwich vicinity. This 
was the site of one of the better mill sites on the Duck River and Mr. Sowell 
operated a mill there for many years. It was also the location of a ford that 
was used by residents in the region. When the Civil War started, Mr. Sowell, 
enlisted and served as Lieutenant Colonel in Company H, 46th Tennessee Infantry, 
Confederate States Army. After the 
war he became quite wealthy as a farmer and miller, later purchasing a mill near 
Andrews. He was involved in the building of the turnpike that was given the name 
&quot;Sowell Mill Pike&quot;, thus perpetuating his name until the present time. He died 
on 14 Aug 1884 and is buried at the top of the hill near his old homeplace, 
overlooking his mill in the Duck River.</font></blockquote>
