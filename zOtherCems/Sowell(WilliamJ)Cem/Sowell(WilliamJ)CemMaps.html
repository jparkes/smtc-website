1988 instructions from Fred Lee Hawkins: &quot;This cemetery is located in one of the prettiest, but most inaccessible areas of 
northeastern Maury County. From
Hwy. 99, go south on Carpenter's Bridge Road, cross Bridge and turn right into 
Sowell's Ford Road. This latter is no
more than a narrow lane leading back into Sowell's Bend.&nbsp; Go for two miles and 
enter a gate on the right. Pass the
house and barn and keep to left side of pasture. The cemetery is in the edge of 
the woods beside a fence.&quot;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

Following the red check above we see the cemetery is in the (jutting) south tip of 
the north tree line right where the field is narrowest between two tree lines.</br>

With this close up aerial view we can actually see tiny white patches that 
appear to be some of the stones of the William J. Sowell Cemetery. </br>
