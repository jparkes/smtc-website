<b>This road map shows the 
location and road needed to get to the Gooch Cemetery. From Columbia go out Hwy 
245 aka Campbellsville Pike about 7+ miles and turn right on Millers Lake Rd. 
Follow that for less than a half a mile and turn right on Mack Benderman known 
in some places as Holt Road. Stop at Bethel Church for permission and 
registration to visit this cemetery. Then follow that road for about a half mile 
and when the road bends back right the cemetery will be on your left in a cedar 
tree area up the slope about 100 yards from the road.</b></br>
