  <pre align="center"><b>DIRECTIONS BY JENNIE JO HARDISON
From downtown Columbia drive south on US 31S, turning east on Tennessee Highway 50E/ the Lewisburg Pike and driving 6.6 
miles from that junction until you cross the Fountain Creek. After crossing Fountain Creek, turn left at the first road, 
the Old Lewisburg Pike. Drive 1.4 miles to the cemetery from TN Hwy 50 by going up a hill until it joins New Vaughn Road 
to the left, continue until the Vaughn Roads divide where you turn left on Vaughn Road driving by an old two story brick 
home on the right. Continue past the house, and in an adjoining, large field the cemetery can be found in a grove of trees 
on the right side of the road. The road ends some 900 feet from the cemetery at the river site of the Old Fountain Creek 
Mill. The foundation of the mill is still visible on both sides of the river. The property owned by the Matthews Family Trust. 
Warren C. Matthews of Greenville, Alabama, is the Trustee.

This is the GSIS location on the TOPO map for the Griffin-Love Cemetery. I do not know if this is correct but know 
the cemetery is in this vicinity. Find this cemetery at these coordinates: 35 32.822' X W86 57.714' This cemetery has few 
stones standing today and will require careful searching to find it. Best time for that is in the winter time with the leaves 
off and high grass mashed down. This is a wonderful map showing several old cemeteries including the Pleasant Mount Cemetery, 
Lancaster Cemetery, Hill Cemetery, Harris Cemetery &amp; the Adkisson Cemetery.</b></pre>
