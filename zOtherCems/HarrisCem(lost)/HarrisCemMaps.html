Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

MS Streets version of the cemetery location still shows Blue Springs Road
complete. That is no longer so.<br/>

<b>This Topozone map shows where the
cemetery is supposed to be on the banks of the Fountain Creek. I believe
these maps were first drawn up in the 1940s and are current to about 1958. </b><br/>

This aerial view shows the place I believe this cemetery might be found
highlighted in faint yellow. The compilers of the
book "They Passed This Way" in 1963 says it was destroyed and that is
pretty strong evidence we will never find anything on this.<i><br/>
