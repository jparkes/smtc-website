<p align="center"><b>HARRIS CEMETERY, (Blue
Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

<br/>
</b>

<b>On T.V.A.(or USGS) maps, this cemetery is shown to be on Blue
Springs Road on the west side of the Fountain Creek near the bluffs. The road to
there used to be Blue Springs Road but was closed in the effort to built the Dam
which was never completed. I do not know the closest route by automobile and
this area is very remote except for farming operations all around. We will show
various positions on multiple maps so that the original mapping location is well
documented. I myself drove out blindly on Blue Springs from the east side and
dead ended right about the mouth of Silver Creek where it empties into Fountain
Creek or about 600 yards east of where this cemetery is suppose to be located.
Since getting there then meant climbing bluffs and fording deep waters no
further attempt was made due to time. <br/>

Mr. Fred Hawkins 1988:<br/>
This cemetery, now destroyed, was located in a very
isolated spot, just west of Fountain Creek and about 1/2 mile from where it
empties into Duck River.</b></p>
<p><b>Commentary 2009:<br/>
The information offered below in 1963 is strong evidence that this cemetery was destroyed.
We should not however give up on looking for these memorial stones even if they
are simply displaced. </b>

No previous researcher offered a listing as to who was interred here but during
1963 the compilers of "They Passed This Way" made these comments and
more: "In the area north of Fountain Heights are three cemeteries
which are shown on various maps. One, the Harris Cemetery was once a fine family
graveyard. Buried here are Edmund Harris, his son Giles Harris and other members
of the family. In comparatively recent years, the stones have been destroyed. We
found (in a pig pen) a fragment: "...RIS,.....daughter of" This is
located near the mouth of Fountain Creek." <i><br/>
