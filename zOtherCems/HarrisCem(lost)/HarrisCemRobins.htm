<p align="center"><font size="2"><b><font color="#000080">HARRIS CEMETERY,&nbsp;(Blue
Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#008000">At the place I stopped to investigate the dead
ended Blue Springs Road That was high upon a bluff over looking the junction of
Silver &amp; Fountain Creek. I heard in the distance a wild sound I had never
heard before. That was a flock of strange sounding birds setting up a noisy
chatter. It sounded like a flock of Parrots, and sent me investigating wondering
why Parrots would be there. Upon closer inspection it proved to be a large flock
of Robins (Robin Red Breast) but the sound echoing across the holler was unique.
I did not know they flocked together that way, but was familiar with their
individual sounds.<br>
