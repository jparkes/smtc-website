Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

MS Streets version of the cemetery location still shows Blue Springs Road
complete. That is no longer so.</br>

<b>This Topozone map shows where the
cemetery is supposed to be on the banks of the Fountain Creek.&nbsp;I believe
these maps were first drawn up in the 1940s and are current to about 1958.&nbsp;</b></br>

This aerial view shows the place I believe this cemetery might be found
highlighted in faint yellow. The compilers of the
book &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; in 1963 says it was destroyed and that is
pretty strong evidence we will never find anything on this.<i></br>
