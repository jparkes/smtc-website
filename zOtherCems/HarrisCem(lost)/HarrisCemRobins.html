<p align="center"><b>HARRIS CEMETERY,&nbsp;(Blue
Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</br>
At the place I stopped to investigate the dead
ended Blue Springs Road That was high upon a bluff over looking the junction of
Silver &amp; Fountain Creek. I heard in the distance a wild sound I had never
heard before. That was a flock of strange sounding birds setting up a noisy
chatter. It sounded like a flock of Parrots, and sent me investigating wondering
why Parrots would be there. Upon closer inspection it proved to be a large flock
of Robins (Robin Red Breast) but the sound echoing across the holler was unique.
I did not know they flocked together that way, but was familiar with their
individual sounds.</br>
