This map from TopoZone showing the GPS coordinate is likely not accurate because 
we only know the general location area 
of this cemetery. Our source is based on the location description of Fred Lee Hawkins 
in 1986.</br>

This closer image of the area shows you why it is difficult to find a cemetery in this 
situation. There are several tree covered area that could contain this cemetery in the 
above aerial view. I highlighted some of them. I do not know where this cemetery is 
located nor under these circumstances will I try to find it without help. If you 
know where it is let me know so it can be permanently plotted for future 
visitors. WayneAL1@aol.com </br>
