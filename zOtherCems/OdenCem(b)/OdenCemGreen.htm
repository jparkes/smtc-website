<font color="#BB2206" size="2"><b>GREEN, Eliza Jane 19 Jun 1827 - 8 May 1851.
&quot;Wife of Andrew Green; daughter of Arthur &amp; Maria Crawford. Mother of
four children&quot; Inscribed as: &quot;SACRED to the memory of Eliza Jane, wife
of Andrew Green &amp; daughter of Arthur &amp; Maria Crawford, who was born June
19th 1827 &amp; departed this life May<br>
8th 1851. She was the mother of four children.&quot;</b></font></P>
<p><font size="2">Eliza Jane (Crawford) Green. Eliza died in 1851 interred in
the Oden Cemetery an African American Cemetery. I suspect the Oden family
secured this old graveyard with one memorial and many unmarked graves as an
opportunity to establish a modern burial ground for their more recent family
members, but I am not sure if this stone has anything to do with their family,
except well, as a part of God's extended family.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The 1850 census of Maury County Dist 12 finds John Green 
perhaps John Andrew Green. There were four small children near Spring Hill. Does this stone have any known connection to
the Oden family who years later perhaps established this as a black graveyard? 
Probably not.<br>
<br>
<u>Dist 12 1850 Census, 13 Nov 1850.</u><br>
Green, John, 25 born in Tennessee<br>
Green, Elizabeth, 27, born in North Carolina (perhaps Eliza)<br>
Green, Joseph, 7, M<br>
Green, Henry, 6 M<br>
Green, Amandy, 4, F <br>
Green, William, 1, M</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Eliza Green memorial is in the middle of the small
(African-American) Oden Cemetery in the northern part of Maury County. However I
suspect Eliza may not have been African-American. All of the African-American Oden
family Cemetery graves are very recent or after 1950. There are old field stones 
marking grave all around and perhaps there was a connection to the Green family 
from these folks buried before or after Eliza Crawford Green.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">During 1851 it was rare for an African-American slaves or even
freedman to use headstones as many other settlers did not use them either.
Not only did Eliza Jane Crawford Green get a headstone she got an exceptional
one with complete vital genealogy information. Something rare in those days. 
Perhaps the Greens were slave owners prior to 1860 and the Oden's ancestors were 
their subjects and that is the background of this cemetery.<br>
