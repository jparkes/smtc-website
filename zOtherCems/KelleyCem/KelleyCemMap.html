<p align="center"><b>KELLEY CEMETERY, 
(Kinderhook) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/KelleyCemTopozone.jpg" width="411" height="357"></br>
This Topozone map shows the GPS Lat. and Long. coordinates of the Kelley 
Cemetery, based on 1950s
roads, but the coordinates are still correct.</br>

The roads have been changed since 1987 but this cemetery should still be easily
found using the same directions from New Hwy 7 instead of Kinderhook Road. Looks
like labeling of the roads above may also be incorrect as there are several New
Hwy 7. I believe Gordon Lawrence Rd is shown correctly on this map though.
Labeled as Potts Cemetery here. This map still shows the old Natchez Trace 
Parkway</br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery in the edge of the tree line on the left of 
the old Natchez Trace Parkway. This map shows the old Natchez Trace Parkway 
terminating on Hwy 7 and the New Natchez Trace Parkway spanning 
northeast/southwest from just east of there. This is the way you will find the 
roads there today.</b><span style="color: #000088; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><i><b></br>
