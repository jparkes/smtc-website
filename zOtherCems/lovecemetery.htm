This cemetery has been completely removed. It was located on the Hays Denton
Road about ½ mile east of Mooresville Pike, on the place that was formerly
owned by Norman Thomas. The 3 graves here were moved by the Love descendants
sometime in the 1970's to the Wilkes-Campground Cemetery and buried in the Love
lot. You will find them there also. <br>

 Over 30 direct descendants of David Love (1763-1827), Revolutionary soldier, with their families and friends 
were present for a grave marking ceremony at Wilkes Cemetery, Culleoka, TN., April 9. 
The services commemorated the reinterment of six ancestors of the Love Family with the dedication of three 
 DAR plaques to David Love, Revolutionary soldier; Mary Draper Love, wife of a Revolutionary soldier, and John 
Draper Love, son of a Revolutionary soldier. They were placed by family members representing 12 DAR and SAR 
chapters. Two more DAR plaques were placed jointly by the Samuel Hammond Chapter DAR, Kosciusko, and Tenassee 
Chapter DAR, Maury County, TN, to Mary Draper Love, daughter of Revolutionary soldier, John Draper and Susannah
 Caruthers Love, wife of John Draper Love, daughter of Revolutionary soldier Robert Caruthers. A government CSA 
marker was also dedicated to Colonel Robert Caruthers Love, son of John Draper and Susannah Caruthers Love, and 
their daughter, Elizabeth Patillo Love Zolicofer was among those honored. 
After Newt Love Jr. of Kosciusko, serving as master of ceremonies, welcomed the group, members of the 
Samuel Hammond Chapter DAR conducted the first part of the memorial program. Renda Love Regan of 
Marietta, GA, led the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, followed by Mary 
Love of Sallis, who gave a short biographical sketch of each ancestor, pointing out that two more of the 
13 children of John Draper Love and Susannah Caruthers Love were also interred in the Wilkes Cemetery, 
Captain Joseph Love, CSA hero, and Jane Crockett Love Wilkes. A history of the restoration project, which 
has taken six years to complete, was presented by Sarah Love Regan of Kosciusko, who expressed appreciation 
to all descendants and friends who had cooperated in preserving this legacy and urged that future projects be 
considered. The DAR grave marking ritual was read by members of the Tenassee Chapter DAR, Mrs. McBroom 
Shirley, regent; Mrs. Mary Graham, chaplain; and Mrs. Betty Gibson, who led the responses. A closing prayer 
concluded the memorial services, given by Paul Love, Glen Allan, MS. 
Other Mississippi family members attending were: Mrs. Newt Love Sr., Mrs. Newt Love Jr., John Clark Love, 
all from Kosciusko; Mrs. Richard Greenlee of Jackson; and Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Whitaker of Armory, who 
brought a quilt which is over 130 years old, made by Elizabeth Love Whitaker, David Love's daughter and 
Whitaker's great-grandmother.

published many years ago in the Columbia Herald about the time of the setting. 
&quot;Oh, yes:  I am descended from both John &quot;Pegleg&quot; Whitaker and his brother Mark.&quot; [Carolyn Whitaker Crowley]
