<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Austin, I have information
on the cemeteries in Maury County. I have done a lot of genealogy and fieldwork on my
families and have a few additions for your website. <i>Bill Thrasher.</i> </br>
</br>
The Freeland Cemetery is on Scribner Mill Road (Brush Creek Road) across the
road from the Haynes Cemetery. This is the burial place of James Gipson Freeland
and his wife , possibly others. However this is not documented anywhere that I
know of. <i>Bill Thrasher</i></br>
