<p><font color="#000080">Mr. Burton Woody who accompanied Fred Hawkins to visit
this cemetery in 1987 told him the following story. &quot;At the end of the Civil War, Abner Brooks II called his
former slaves together. He told them that they were now free and could go wherever
they pleased and carry on their lives
as they wished. He then called one of them,
</font><font color="#800000"> Nelson Brooks</font><font color="#000080">, aside and told
</font><font color="#800000"> him</font><font color="#000080">
that should
</font><font color="#800000"> he Nelson</font><font color="#000080"> want to remain on
the place, he would give
</font><font color="#800000"> him</font><font color="#000080"> 35 acres of land in recognition of
</font><font color="#800000"> his long and
loyal service</font><font color="#000080"> to the Brooks family.
</font><font color="#800000">
Nelson</font><font color="#000080"> accepted this offer and lived nearby for the remainder of
</font><font color="#800000"> his</font><font color="#000080"> life.&quot;<br>
The below listed
</font><font color="#800000">Nelson Brooks cemetery</font><font color="#000080">
was located by Wayne
Austin 8 Apr 2009 and is shown here. It is located correctly by the
USGS Geological Services. The USGS has no records of the (white) Abner II Brooks
Cemetery nearby. Consequently it was not found by Wayne Austin, but is added
here in hopes someone will step forward and send in the information &amp; photos
after
locating this cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
