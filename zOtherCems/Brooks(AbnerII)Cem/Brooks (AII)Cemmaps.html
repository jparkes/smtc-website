The yellow pointers
indicate prime places to look for this cemetery. One of them points to the
Nelson Brooks cemetery which I did find. This cemetery is not detailed on the USGS records so
I have provided this
improvised map to attempt to locate it. It makes sense that this cemetery would
be in an area within 1/2 mile from the Nelson Brooks Cemetery since Nelson
Brooks was donated 35 acres of land from the Abner II Brooks estate. It was on
the Woodrow Johnson property in 1987 south of Snow Creek Road. </b></p><b>

map has the Brooks (Abner II) cemetery somewhere in its locations, but it is not

hesitate to say it is lost just because I was unable to get the time to locate
someone who knew where it was.</b></span><b> So
another try later maybe.</b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
