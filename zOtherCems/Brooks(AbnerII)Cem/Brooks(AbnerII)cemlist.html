marked with fieldstones. [F.L.H. 4 Feb 1987.]</p>
<p>Mr. Burton Woody who accompanied Fred Hawkins to visit
this cemetery in 1987 told him the following story. &quot;At the end of the Civil War, Abner Brooks II called his
former slaves together. He told them that they were now free and could go wherever
they pleased and carry on their lives
as they wished. He then called one of them,
 Nelson Brooks, aside and told
 him
that should
 he Nelson want to remain on
the place, he would give
 him 35 acres of land in recognition of
 his long and
loyal service to the Brooks family.

Nelson accepted this offer and lived nearby for the remainder of
 his life.&quot;</br>
The below listed
Nelson Brooks cemetery
was located by Wayne
Austin 8 Apr 2009 and is shown here. It is located correctly by the
USGS Geological Services. The USGS has no records of the (white) Abner II Brooks
Cemetery nearby. Consequently it was not found by Wayne Austin, but is added
here in hopes someone will step forward and send in the information &amp; photos
after
locating this cemetery.&nbsp;</br>

Above is shown the only stones &amp; graves I found. I am uncertain if there are
others. This graveyard was so grown up it was impossible to know what was there
for sure. [WA 4 Apr 2009]</br>
