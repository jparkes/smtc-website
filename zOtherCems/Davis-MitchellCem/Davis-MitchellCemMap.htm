This map shows the GPS Coordinates for the Davis-Mitchell cemetery which is important for
finding it. It appears to be lost in the hills south of Hwy 412/99 near Hickory
Ridge Trail subdivision. I believe it is about the location of the Beech Groove
Church as that marking may be a historic notation for a church that was once
there.<br>

This road map shows the Davis-Mitchell Cemetery further out Newt Hood Road south of Bear Creek Pike (Hwy 412) Turn
into Mt Olivet Road and take the left fork which is shown on the above map as
Newt Hood Road and travel south. Mr. Fred says &quot;follow the black top for 1
mile and enter new road on right&quot; which is now also black topped. Go 1/4
mile to the top of the&nbsp; hill. Cemetery is on left hand side of road in a
clump of trees. &nbsp;<br>

I have used a yellow indicator to show where the GPS points to where this cemetery may
lie.<br>
