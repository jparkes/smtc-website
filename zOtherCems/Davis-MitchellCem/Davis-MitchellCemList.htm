</b>Note from Melissa Mitchell to MB McClain 20 May 2010: Josiah Mitchell, Sr.,
was my g-g-grandfather Asa Mitchell's brother. I had him in my family tree
charts, but I didn't know where he was buried. The unmarked grave could be his
first wife, Jane Lewis Oliver, or his second wife, Mary C. Westmoreland. Jane
died in Jun 1863, and he married Mary later that same year in December. If it
looks very old, it is probably Jane's. Melissa Mitchell melissamitchell319@hotmail.com</br>

* Stones not found for these listings by Mr Fred Hawkins which are shown on page C-53 of &quot;They Passed
This Way.&quot; This may be related to deterioration in the condition of the
cemetery, specifically stones that have sunken into the ground. It also may be
related to missing stones or listings from that book that may not be from
gravestones.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
I have made more than one trip to that area looking for the Davis-Mitchell
Cemetery during 2008/2009 but, was unable to find it or locate anyone who knew
were it is located.&nbsp;&nbsp; New housing development in the area has confused
the directions Mr Fred gave.&nbsp; Wayne Austin 20 May 2010.</br>

			<p class="MsoNormal">Wayne,</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Are you 
			still visiting Maury County to photograph cemeteries? I have found a 
			cemetery that you have listed as �lost� which is in fact not lost. 
			The Davis- Mitchell Cemetery is in the front yard, right hand side 
			near the road of 131 Shapiro Trail in a small grove of trees. The 
			next house down on the same side of the road is 123 (odd numbering 
			system) and it has a stone right beside the two trees by the 
			driveway. Just wanted to pass this on. </p>
