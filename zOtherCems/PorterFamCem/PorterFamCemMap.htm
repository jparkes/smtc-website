FAMILY CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

Topographical map dated in the 1950s shows the area of the cemetery several yards from the road. 
However, even though I have not been to this cemetery I believe these location 
coordinates are incorrect. All Instructions say this cemetery is on the 
Hoover-Mason Road and that is about a mile west of this location. I have briefly 
searched this location for this cemetery in the past and did not find it and 
that confirms the GPS coordinates is wrong. </font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><br>

Since I do not believe this mapping is correct, I offer no instructions as to 
how to get here, but you can see the route shown from Mt Pleasant on the left 
or West of here about 3 miles.<br>

The GPS coordinates as given on all mapping are pegged above with the red #2. 
There is no sign of a cemetery there so if the coordinates are only partially 
wrong then I could suspect #1 as the location above. This is a clump of trees 
typically where you will find an old 
cemetery, but as stated above all written instructions have this cemetery on 
Hoover Mason Road a mile to the left (west) of here so all this plotting may be 
in vain.</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><br>
