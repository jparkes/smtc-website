	</br>
	Can you help me out on the parents of James Eddleman?</br>
	He is buried at the Porter Family Cemetery.</br>
	1 Fred Hawkins in Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries states he is the son of 
	Charlie &amp; Martha F. Porter Eddleman</br>
	2 Then I received an e-mail from Georgia gcooley@verizon.net stating he is 
	the son of Francis W. Eddleman &amp; Martha Jane Porter Eddleman.</br>
	You have #2 in your leave flower notes on F-A-G. Do you remember your 
	reference for that information</br>

	(More from Charlotte)</br>
	</br>
	</br>
	How are you doing? I think of you, often, and I hope that things are better 
	for you. I was in Mt PLeasant last October and went by your husband's grave. 
	You have done so much for that little cemetery, it was really looking 
	pretty!</br>
	</br>
	I know that I have your address and phone number somewhere, but I couldn't 
	find it so I will attempt to summarize what I have gleaned from my research. 
	First, I have done a lot of research on James Eddlemon, not because I was 
	looking for him, but I was trying to determine if he was the father of 
	another James Eddlemon. </br>
	</br>
	James Willis Eddlemon (1890-1951) was the husband of my ggreat aunt, 
	Elizabeth (Lizzie) Clay Stockard. I asked my grandmother's younger brother's 
	how he was related to our Eddlemons; they told me that he was their 
	grandfather's brother. I say their grandfather because they are my 
	grandmother's half brothers. Their grandfather was Issac D. Eddlemon, I am 
	sure you have heard of him, he murdered his son, and nothing was done.</br>
	</br>
	Harris Bell Stockard, my great grandfather (and Lizzie's brother), was 
	married to Elsie Henson; they had two daughters, including my grandmother, 
	Rubie M Stockard. Several years after Elsie's death, Harris married Margaret 
	Elizabeth (Bessie) Eddlemon, Isaac's daughter.</br>
	</br>
	Then my grandmother married Sylvester Graff, son of Ruben Graff and Martha 
	Eddlemon. Martha is Isaac's sister. Martha, James Willis and Isaac are the 
	children of Charles Wesley Eddlemon and Martha Thomas. SO you can see that I 
	am related to the Eddlemons in three different ways. Anyway, after talking 
	to Kathy Nicholson of Maury Co, I found that there is at least one more 
	sibling, Anna Belle. Kathy's husband is a grandson or great grandson of 
	Isaac. Kathy had talked at great length with the Aunt Anna Belle, and she 
	knew of a brother who had removed himself from the family, and what she had 
	learned had kind of substantiated what my uncles said, but I have no 
	documentation that James Willis is their sibling.</br>
	</br>
	Getting back to Charles and his wife, my research indicates that Charles 
	married Delia Thomason. My grandmother had told me that her name was Thomas, 
	and the families of three of the four of her children that I know of, 
	indicate that their grandmother's name was Martha Thomas. Kathy and Michelle 
	Cannon have done extensive research and they believe that Delia (Cordelia) 
	Thomason and Martha Thomas are one in the same. I only met Kathy last fall, 
	but I would trust Michelle's determination, as I would your's or Doug 
	Baker's. I know that each of you are very serious about your research and 
	documentation of your findings. I should also mention that the only death 
	record that indicated someone other than Martha Thomas, was James Willis'. 
	His dau, Nora Kate was the informant. When asked for 
	mother and father, she gave them her momma and daddy's names. The other 
	thing that concerned me was James Willis' obit. His parents were indicated 
	as Mr and Mrs Jimmie Eddlemon, that bothered Michelle also. IF the Obit had 
	said Mr and Ms James Eddlemon, I would have assumed that the info had been 
	taken from the erroneous death record supplied by Nora Kate, but it says, 
	&quot;Jimmie.&quot;</br>
	</br>
	Charles Wesley was the son of Francis Wesley Eddlemon and Martha Frances 
	(Jane) Porter. My grandmother had told me that her name was Porter, but I 
	have no marriage record for them. I have seen the will of her father James 
	Porter, and if memory serves me, he mentions her married name and notes that 
	she is in Maury County, TN. I have found seven sons and one dau for Frank 
	and Martha; the 1900 census indicates there were nine children. I have John 
	James as theis oldest; I lose track of him after the 1880 census, but I have 
	a death cert that matches the dates provided for the James at Porter's. We 
	could not get into the cemetery when we were there last year, so I have not 
	seen the headstone. I am using the data provided at findagrave and the Maury 
	County Cemeteries website. </br>
	</br>
	Charles was the informant for his brother James' death record, and he lists 
	Jim's parent's as Jim Eddlemon and Matha Porter. </br>
	</br>
	http://search.ancestry.com/browse/view.aspx?dbid=2376&amp;iid=33113_257780-00506&amp;pid=144547&amp;ssrc=&amp;fn=Jim&amp;ln=Eddlemon&amp;st=g</br>
	</br>
	I have death certs for three of James' siblings (Francis Newton, Charles, 
	Robert Parks), and each of them indicate Frank as their father. All of the 
	census records that I have for the family notates Frank, FW or F. I remember 
	seeing the notations that you left at findagrave, and I thought that maybe 
	you had picked up Charles name by accident from the death record because he 
	was listed as an informant. I chose to leave what I had determined to be 
	correct, and I did not bother you because it was either shortly after or 
	before your James' death, and I was not going to bother you. But, all of my 
	records indicate that John James was the son of Frank (Francis) and Martha 
	Porter.</br>
	</br>
	I am telling you, those Eddlemons and Graffs will be the death of me. I 
	spent seven days last October in Maury County and don't think I had an 
	opportunity to work on anything else and I probably left with more questions 
	than answers; that is when I met Kathy Nicholson. Mom and I did order 
	headstones for Elsie and the baby's graves at Spencer's. It was something 
	that my grandmother had always talked of doing, but never got around to it. 
	Mom and I are planning another trip in October, we don't have any dates as 
	of yet, but we want to go check on the stones. </br>
