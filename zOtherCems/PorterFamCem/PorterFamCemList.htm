FAMILY CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</b><b></br>
</b><a href="PorterFamCemMap.htm">Mapping the Location of the cemetery</a><p>
</br>
Porter Cemetery, Hoover Mason Rd. Mt. Pleasant Tn. the City of Mt Pleasant now owns the land now 
and is putting a sewer system there near the Cemetery. Mr Fred Hawkins said this 
about the location in 1987. On a rise west of road that follows Scott Creek. I 
think this is called Haul Roads on some maps and goes northwest from Porters to 
connect to Hoover Mason Road north of there a mile or two. This graveyard is 
located atop of a small knoll left there when the area all around it was mined 
for phosphate.</br>
