This map from TopoZone is likely not accurate for the GPS Coordinates. That means the coordinates above are 
somewhat or to a great degree inaccurate.<br>

Columbia go south down Highway 245 for about four miles and turn right or west 
on Reese's Church Road. Go 2,500+ feet or .50 miles or 884 yards and face right 
(north) and go up a grown up fence row (which contains a residence to secure 
information and permission from) for 1,000 feet which is 333 Yards or .1883 of a 
mile and the cemetery is likely in the thicket this ends up in. It (thicket) is 
where three fence rows come together. That thicket has some appearances of an 
abandoned cemetery because it bulges a bit. </span></B>

 color=#000080 size=2>The authors of &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; 
say it was cleared as if it is inside a open field in 1963. I do see a faint 
image 50 yards out in the field west of that same thicket that may be the 
remnant of that cemetery which is three bases and one old box tomb that have 
been basically dismantled and broken probably by vandals looking for treasure. 
Since those early 1960s the cemetery could have grown back up though so that is 
absolutely a clue.&nbsp; In small unreported cemeteries the GPS reporting is 
rarely exact, but maybe the cemetery is around this place within about 200 
yards. However it may be more than 1/2 mile if there are errors. I must say a 
1/2 mile variant is an impossibility for finding a lost cemetery. All this 
confusion is why I have not tackled locating this cemetery in the past. If I 
waste two hours here I can make 400 tombstone photos in that time.<br>

Here I have posted a large round yellow highlight where I think this cemetery 
may be found assuming the mapping is close to the truth.<br>

This image of the area shows you why it is difficult to find a cemetery in this 
situation. I do not see a sign of this cemetery in the field unless it was 
destroyed. It may be found along the fence row thickets or in the two thickets 
out in the field to the right. Something should be said for the Thomas Hollow 
location in that Thomas Springs is north of this spot nearly 1/4 mile and may I 
assume that spring carved out Thomas Hollow from the Hills so that area needs to 
be explored around Demastus Road. <br>
