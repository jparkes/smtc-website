Originally listed in late 1950's by Evelyn B.
Shackelford and Don Shackelford.</br>
Since then (1950s), the cemetery has been incorporated, and cleared off. Several trips have
been (were) made to this old and historic spot. In January, 1963 Evelyn B.
Shackelford and Marise Lightfoot reworked or checked each stone.</br>
</br>
WRIGHT GRAVEYARD, Located Thomas Hollow, Campbellsville Pike. (this is something
over 1/4 mile north of Reese's chapel). These stones dug-up out of ground and</br>
the pieces of the stones were put together like jigsaw puzzle - probably Kittrell Kin (see Hunter-Kittrell Cemetery, page A-62. Ruth Kittrell's
(1765-1848) Will
names a daughter Nancy, wife of Gedeon Wright.</br>

said she could see a connection
for the Wrights in is cemetery and the Hunter/Kittrell's and Overstreet's down
the road. Velaria Wright, daughter of Gideon Wright
and Nancy Kittrell was the second wife of Absalom Burkett. His first wife was Barsheda Overstreet. Velaria A.P. Burkett is buried in the Hunter-Kittrell Cemetery.</br>

I recently took a group on a trip in an attempt to find this graveyard. We
followed the mapping instructions and wound up at a house. An old gentleman came
out of this house and at that point I thought we were about 200 yards south of
the cemetery. He proceeded to tell us that he had lived there 30 years and
hunted all around his extensive farm and never knew of a Wright Cemetery in that
area. So&nbsp; this mapping above is wrong or this cemetery has been lost or
destroyed. Since it composed of box tombs it is harder to lose an old cemetery
like by the stones sinking into the ground. Its just phenomenal how many of
these old family cemeteries we are losing due to neglect even in the last 30
years. </br>

<i><b>This cemetery listing was&nbsp; condensed from the above two books. Due to
the difficulty that prior cemetery publishers had I have not attempted to find
it. I add it here due to interest in finding it by family members. If anyone knows where it is let me know and I will
go to Maury County, visit
and resurvey it for any scrap of evidence that may tell further information
about the mysteries of this old graveyard. A photo will at least tell us
possibly more about what the fragments were meant to say. E-mail:
