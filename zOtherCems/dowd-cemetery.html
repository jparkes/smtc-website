letter of dismissal in 1820; a Chancery Court case from Maury County dated 1831
lists her as the aunt of James C. Record. He was one of the first commissioners
in Marshall County, Tennessee. She was most likely a sister of his mother, Mary
Moore. His father, John W. Record Sr., did not have a sister Jane. Also
mentioned in the case are John R. Dowd and James R. Dowd but no relationships
mentioned.)</p>

record that the grave is on edge of large area covered with bushes and briers.
This was in 1964. They searched carefully for other graves but did not find any.
Mr. Hawkins did his survey in 1986 and talked with a resident of the vicinity
who told him that other burials had been made there. After 1900 he said that
those buried here have been African-American. Mr. Hawkins did state that there
were no other inscribed stones.</span></p>
