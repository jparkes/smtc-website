Mrs. Nora Smith, owner of the
estate in 1986, said that if there had ever been inscribed stones in this large
cemetery they have been gone for many
years. She thinks that this was the slave cemetery for this southern plantation,
owned by Dr. J. T. S. Thompson (1836 - 1890) prior to, and during, the Civil War. Dr Thompson and
some of his family are interred in
the nearby Jackson College Cemetery.</br>

5 Jan 1987. Most of the information comes
from that book, but I have been there a couple of times and can agree that there are no visible
inscribed stones here. WA 10 Sep 2009. Visited there in 2001. </span></i></br>
