There are also many graves marked with fieldstones, a part of which are said 
to be graves of slaves owned by neighborhood white families. The place is now 
badly neglected, the fence is falling down and many markers have tumbled. The 
surrounding area has been mined, but the land has been recovered. The old Kinzer 
house burned several years ago. Mr. Fred Hawkins was taken to this cemetery by 
Mr. W. M. Dodson who for a period of 17 years had lived on this farm. F.L.H 22
