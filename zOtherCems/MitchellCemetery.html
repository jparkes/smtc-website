<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Austin, I just have a little info
on cemeteries in Maury. I have done a lot of genealogy and fieldwork on my
families and have a few additions for your website. <i>Bill Thrasher.</i> </br>
</br>
Location: Mitchell Cemetery is on land formerly owned by Luther Lamar now owned
by his daughter Ruth and husband Jonathan Bates. It is just past the AME church
on right side of Hwy. 50 before reaching Park Station.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
Several people have told me of this one but I was unable to find it. It is said
to have marked memorial stones for the Mitchell family.&nbsp;</br>
