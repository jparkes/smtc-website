Church &amp; School</br>
<b>It is thought this cemetery was near the site of the old Oak Grove M.E.
Church which existed here in the mid-twentieth century. In Robbins, Century
Review of Maury County, Tennessee: 1807 - 1907, this is said: Oak Grove
Church is on the Natchez Trace, 2 1/2 miles northeast of Kinderhook. It was
established in the 1840's and served by pastors of the Santa Fe Circuit. The
organization disbanded some 25 years ago (ca 1881.) A school was maintained
here from the 1840's. The frame structure was erected about 1892, and recent
teachers (1907) have been Raleigh Elam, Bettie Potts, T. W. Rail, Savannah
Priest, Florence Bassham, Allie Walters, Fannie Cowley &amp; A. McKnight.
