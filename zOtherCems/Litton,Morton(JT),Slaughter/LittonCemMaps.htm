A red check shows the location of the Litton Cemetery.
The position on the map for the GPS coordinates are correct as far as I know, but
I have
not been there to check it yet. The New Natchez Trace Road cuts across below this
spot making this map confusing to compare with the maps today.</br>

<b>&nbsp;The above yellow arrow points to the place one
should be able to find this cemetery. As you can see there is more than one
arrow which indicates the places that will need investigation to find this
cemetery. Likely the spot
at the point of the right arrow is correct.</br>

<b>The cemetery is on the north side of Natchez Trace (old) midway between
Kinderhook and Johnson Chapel. This MS Streets map does not have the new Natchez
Trace Road on it except as a secondary Road.</br>
