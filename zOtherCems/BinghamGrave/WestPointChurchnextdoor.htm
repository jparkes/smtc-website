These are views of a
declining old structure ordinarily not worth anyone's attention except that this
is history and the knowledge needs to be preserved. Unfortunately about all I
know so far is what I see above. What I see is a structure that is old. The
front entrance has the dual doors, one for men, and one for the ladies. That was
a 19th century tradition that is no longer practiced. This tradition was
prevalent in the south in olden times when the men sat on one side and women the
other. The entrance was later modified to have a main entrance in the center of
that to include both sexes indicating many years of use. Another indication of
age is the rock steps are clearly limestone or granite and not concrete.
Concrete is a product of the 20th century. I can go back and study the
architecture later when the Poison Ivy is dormant because I believe the block
walls were added adjacent to clap board or wooden walls. It is not clear if the
blocks are concrete or perhaps carved limestone.&nbsp; </br>
On topographical maps generally drawn up in the 1950s this is shown as the West
Point Church not denoting any other information. There is also a West Point
Cumberland Presbyterian Church on the Theta Pike about 10 miles north east of
this place that may or may not have something to do with this. So much for the
frustrations of a long distance historical analysis. Stay tuned to this page as
I later try to develop the history of this place.</br>
