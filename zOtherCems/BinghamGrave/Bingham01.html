<b>BINGHAM, John W. S.
12 Nov 1829 - 3 Aug 1851. <br/>
Mr. Pat Hickman who lives across the hill informed me of the location of this stone.
He lived  here at one time. He
says legend has it that 21 year old John went down to the creek after working around the farm one
day and dipped his head in the creek, but he died there.
Evidently he either became sick or went there to cool off after overheating.
Amazing how stories live on after 157 years. The old house in the photo is
probably as old as this stone. It has features that belies it age.<br/>
