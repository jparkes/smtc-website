<b>BINGHAM, John W. S.
12 Nov 1829 - 3 Aug 1851.&nbsp;</br>
Mr. Pat Hickman who informed of the location of this stone used to live here. He
says 21 year old John went down to the creek after working around the farm one
day and dipped his head in the creek, but he never came up and died there.
Evidently he either became sick or went there to cool off after overheating.
Amazing how stories live on after 157 years. The old house in the photo is
probably as old as this stone as it has features that belies it age. The old
Church building next door.&nbsp;</br>
