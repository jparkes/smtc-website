  <b>Besides
  the stone of Martha Kirk Zollicoffer the only stones that have been discovered
  are just fieldstones with no inscriptions on them. As far as I have found, no
  one knows where John Jacob Zollicoffer is buried but it is likely that he is 
  interred here in an unmarked grave.&nbsp; [Rick Gray.]</b></span></font></p>
  <p>
  <b>Note: When Mr. Hawkins was there in 1988, he stated that the inscribed top of
  the stone was buried too far in the ground to read. The only difference I have
  found in my research is that her granddaughter, Octavia Zollicoffer Bond, 
  records in the book &quot;Heritage Quest&quot; that she died on 15 Jun 1815. [Rick 
  Gray.]</br>
  ** General Felix Kirk Zollicoffer was the first Confederate General killed in 
  the west. </b></font><b>Born 19 
  May 1812 and died 19 Jan 1862 in the Civil War, a Confederate Brigadier 
  General, he was killed in action while leading his brigade during the Battle 
  of Mill Springs (Fishing Creek, Logan's Crossroads), Kentucky. While 
  reconnoitering forward of his lines, he ran into the enemy lines, and was shot 
  dead. A cenotaph exists in the Zollicoffer Confederate Cemetery on the 
  battlefield, near Nancy, Kentucky, but Zollicoffer's body was sent to his 
  family in Nashville for burial where he lies in the Nashville National 
  Cemetery. For much more of this story and accompanying photos see
