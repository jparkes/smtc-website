This map from TopoZone is likely not accurate. That means the coordinates above are inaccurate. The stone with this location would be in an
open field. I saw no sign of such when I was there from the road. I did not visit this
cemetery due to the difficulty of finding it in Nov 08. I will return when the
trees shed their leaves.<br/>

</b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">The red plus is close to where I think
this cemetery can be found. The placement according to Topozone and the Lat.
&amp; Long. are not accurate. A boxtomb could be seen as a light spot on the map
above. Stay tuned as I fix this after an actual finding of this cemetery. This is just the first place I will look.
Hopefully the stone is still standing
and not below the ground. [WA 30 Nov 2008]<br/>
