This cemetery according
to my map calculations is 600 yards out in front of us near the base line of the
distant hill. The little Cedar Tree is almost blocking our view of the place I
have pegged to look first. The above photo was what I call a spotter photo and
was made standing on Whiteside Road. It is an educated guess and not an actual
location.</B><i><B
