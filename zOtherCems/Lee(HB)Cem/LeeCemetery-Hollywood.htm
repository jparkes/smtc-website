CEMETERY-HOLLYWOOD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
</font></b>

<div align="left">
  <pre><font size="3" face="Courier" color="#800000">Go south on Pulaski Pike (Hwy 31) and continue past McCains four more miles. The cemetery is on 
the west side of road just before Scott's Hollow Road entrance on the right side. The cemetery 
is on hillside, about 100 feet from the road. 

I tried to find this cemetery in 2005 but there is no hillside 100 feet from hwy 31 near the 
junction of <a href="LeeCemetery-Maps.htm">Hwy 31 &amp; Scott Hollow Road</a>. Further confusing the issue GPS pointers on Delorme 
maps indicated the cemetery was smack in the middle of someone's front yard. I fear the worst 
for this little family graveyard. [WA 2006]
 

<b>LEE, H. B.</b>, 2 Aug 1842 - 29 Jul 1911. Includes footstone initials: H. B. L. (Henry B. Lee was 
born in Buckingham Co., Va. and served in Company E. 53rd Tennessee Infantry, Confederate 
States Army. 
<b>LEE, Martha S.</b>, 25 Jan 1847 - 20 May 1921. Includes her footstone with initials: M. S. L. 
(Martha Susan Fowler Lee; married August 25, 1866 to Henry B. Lee in Marshall County Tn.) 
<b>LEE, Rush</b>, (no dates), died during 1911 at age 35, was the son of Henry B. &amp; Martha Fowler, 
he was married to Lena Head, stone not found during 1988. 

Confederate Soldiers &amp; Patriots of Maury County page 210; says this family apparently suffered 
a calamity during 1911 because the father and five children between the ages of 30 and 44 years, 
died in the same year. According to Mr. Hawkins MCTC in 1988 this is a small cemetery and was 
enclosed in a small iron fence which was not large enough for seven graves.

  <pre><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><font size="3" face="Courier">Hollywood Tennessee was named after a giant Hollywood Tree that grew on the west side
of Highway 31 for many years. It could have been hundreds of years old. The tree had 
the bright red holly berries so prized by wildlife in the wintertime. I remember
passing by there in the 1950s while riding in the back of my parents black 1949
