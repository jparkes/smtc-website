  <pre>Go south on Pulaski Pike (Hwy 31) and continue past McCains four more miles. 
The cemetery is on the west side of road just before Scott's Hollow Road 
entrance on the right side. The cemetery is on hillside, about 100 feet 
from the road. 

I tried to find this cemetery in 2005 but there is not the hillside 100 
feet from hwy 31 near the junction of Hwy 31 &amp; Scott Hollow Road. Only 
the spring branch. Further confusing the issue GPS pointers on Delorme 
maps indicated the cemetery was smack in the middle of someone's front yard 
where I could clearly see there were no memorials. I have marked an x above 
where possibly there might be a cemetery since that is the only incline of a 
hill side and it is in the thicket where a small cemetery might be found. The 
marked spot is about 400 feet from highway 31 across the Hopewell branch.  <center></pre>
