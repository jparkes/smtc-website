cemetery. The cabin that once stood here has been destroyed and area has been
mined. Searched for, but not found, on 14 Oct 1987,[Fred Lee Hawkins.]&nbsp;<br>
I have not searched this place but judging by the map of the 1950 topography the
area has been mined heavily. It is almost a sure bet the stone has been
bulldozed into the mines. There are multiple reasons for believing that. The
main one is the cemetery was never placed on the maps. Another is there was only
one stone and those are hard for the site crew to spot. 24
