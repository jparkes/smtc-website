(William) CEMETERY (lost), Southport, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

Location of the lost McConnell Cemetery is said to be here
according to Jack Dugger and others.</br>
</b>The graveyard was said to be
where McKnight's Branch runs into Little Bigby Creek. I was just wondering if
the branch that runs into Little Bigby Creek between Bethel Creek Road and the
Mt. Pleasant Road, (Southport Road on the map), could at one time have been called
McKnights Branch and just maybe the McConnell graveyard is located there.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">To find this
lost cemetery from
Columbia go south out of Columbia on Highway 245 (Campbellsville Pike) about 9
or 10 miles miles. Just past he Southport Road on your left turn west on Bethel
Church Rd known as Miller Lake Road on many maps today. Cross over Little
Bigbyville Creek and look on your right for a place to park and examine this
area closely between these two creeks for signs of a lost cemetery. WA 25 Aug
