Burney, Col. John M.,</b> 31 Dec 1821 � 25 Aug
1874 (son of John Burney and Matilda Young; married Mary Jane �Molly�
Alexander on 8 Dec 1859). John M. Burney was born in <st1:state>
<st1:place>
North Carolina</st1:place>
</st1:state>
 on <st1:date day="31" month="12" year="1821">
31 Dec 1821</st1:date>
 to John Burney and Matilda Young. He was most likely born in <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Guilford</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>
County</st1:placetype>
</st1:place>
 where his parents lived before coming to <st1:state>
<st1:place>
Tennessee</st1:place>
</st1:state>
. The family is reported to have lived in <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Williamson</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>
County</st1:placetype>
</st1:place>
 and <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Henry</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>

</st1:place>
 before settling in <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Maury</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>
County</st1:placename>
</st1:place>
. One source states that his father died in <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Henry</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>
County</st1:placename>
</st1:place>
. Another source states that his father died in <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Maury</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>
County</st1:placename>
</st1:place>
. There is no marker for his father at the family cemetery. The first record I
have for John M. Burney is the 1850 census. John and his brother, James, are
listed as living with A. P. Bailey in District 22 of Maury County in 1850. John
is listed as a teacher. He is probably one of the Burney brothers who is listed
as a teacher in the area of McCain�s church and school. The other Burney
brother is most likely his brother Alfred M. Burney who was an early principal
at McCain�s. An online history of the McCain�s Church, compiled by Ronnie
Erwin, states that the Burney brothers taught at the school for the first four
terms before enlisting in the War Between the States. I am not sure where John
acquired the title of Colonel. There is a reference to a Colonel Burney in the <st1:place>
<st1:placename>
Maury</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>
County</st1:placename>
</st1:place>

near A. Thompson and William Everett.� On <st1:date day="8" month="12" year="1859">

, he joined in Holy Matrimony with Mary Jane �Molly� Alexander, daughter of
Ozni Alexander and Mary Doak Hannah. John passed away on <st1:date day="25" month="8" year="1874">
25 Aug 1874</st1:date>
 and was interred here in the Burney family cemetery.</p>
