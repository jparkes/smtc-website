            Evidence of a few other graves were found also.  The area was once in the midst of a mining operation but the cemetery was spared by the miners.  The surrounding land was later reclaimed and the knoll on which the cemetery is located is about five feet higher than the general level.  The cemetery is enclosed in a wrought iron fence, but is grown  over with locus and hackberry trees.
