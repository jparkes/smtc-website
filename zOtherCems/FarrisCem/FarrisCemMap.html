This map shows the GPS Coordinates for the Farris Cemetery which are important for
finding it. It appears to be lost at least to me in the area south of Bear Creek 
Pike. I do not believe the above map designation to be correct. I have been 
there and was unable to locate a cemetery using these coordinates. The area back 
to the west of there across that hollow is where I think the cemetery will be 
found. It along with the lost Street Cemetery also shown on the road map below.</br>

This road map shows the Farris Cemetery along Bear Creek Pike, south of and 
above the creek and highway. I have been here a couple of times and was not 
successful in locating this cemetery.</br>

I have placed a red check where the GPS locater says the cemetery is located. I 
was unable to locate it there and believe it is in the deep woods left and west 
of there somewhere. I also walked along the south bank of Bear Creek all the way 
over to the TVA Electrical transmission lines shown as a long swath, bear of 
vegetation above, and did not find it that way either. Another day with better 
instructions may yet turn it up. I understand it is inside a small fence. Cemeteries like this are 
difficult. I travel 80 miles to find them only 
to have this result. Partly why I fail? I won't devote more then 30 
minutes to finding a cemetery before I move onto another. Time is valuable in 
my efforts to photograph as many cemeteries as I can. The following is Mr Fred 
Hawkins instruction in 1987 for finding the cemetery:
Go east on Highway 99 for four miles and turn right, cross Bear Creek, on Cranford Hollow Road.  Take 
a right on Cochran Road to 
the side of house, pass barn and go back into area formerly mined for phosphate. The cemetery is on  a hillock almost over looking Bear Creek Pike.                         

This agrees with my assessment of back into the forest as noted above.</br>
