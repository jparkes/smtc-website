Located on the John Abernathy place (1988), behind the house in a pasture. From 
Columbia bypass (Hwy 50) go south on Campbellsville Pike to the Golf Course. 
From there continue two and a half miles and turn east, cross the creek and go 
to the end of the lane. 1988 Instructions of Fred Hawkins.<br/>

This Aerial Map based on the Topozone and USGS coordinates shows the cemetery in 
a small clump of trees behind a house upon the slope.<br/>

Zooming in using this map with a red check shows the cemetery behind what I 
think is an old house. All these directions are based on the USGS coordinates. I 
have not been here and cannot confirm this. The chances of this being correct is 
about 85% based on my experience with other remote cemeteries. [C Wayne Austin 5
