In Williamsport 
traveling north west toward the bridge over the Duck River bridge take 
Washington Street and go by Williamsport Methodist Church Cemetery on the right. 
Go on to the (African American) Christ Tabernacle Church and turn &amp; face east. Go 
across the grounds to the east and bear slightly south &amp; the cemetery will be in the back 
of the mowed area in the corner of the open field. It will be about 200 yards 
southeast of the nearby Christ Tabernacle Church.</b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br/>

The red check shows the cemetery back in the clearing next to the woods and 
though the cemetery is mowed when I was there in 2009 it is surrounded by 
woodland on three sides.<br/>
