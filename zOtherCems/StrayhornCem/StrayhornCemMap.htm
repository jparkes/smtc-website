This map from TopoZone is likely not accurate. That means the coordinates above are inaccurate. The stone with this location would be in a ploughed or
cultivated field. I saw no sign of such when I was there. I did not visit this
cemetery due to the visit being in the summer and that area being infested in
Chiggers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>

this cemetery can be found. Stay tuned as I fix this after an actual visit. Many
times I am wrong. This is just the first place I will look and is now based on
the photo shown as the grove in the field. Hopefully the stone is still standing
and can be found. [WA 28 Sep 2008]</br>
