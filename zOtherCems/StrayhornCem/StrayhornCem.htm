<P align=center><B>STRAYHORN
GRAVE-MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</B>
</P>1967 Instructions,
They Passed this way: Between Cross Bridges and Cedar Hill just
north of the Hampshire Pike on the old English Place.</br>
Mr. Fred Hawkins in Maury County Cemeteries says from Cross Bridges follow Hwy
214 west for 1.75 miles. The Graveyard is north of the road in a grove of
trees.</br>
My instructions 5 Nov 2008, created from adjusting the Longitude and Latitude
Coordinates above: From Cross Bridges Methodist Church Cemetery go west about
one mile and and turn right on Booker Ridge Road. When the road bends north 90
degrees look to your left at a grove of trees protruding into the field. I
believe it can be found easily there in the wintertime assuming the stone is
still standing.

Update 31 Jul 2014:<tt></br>
This lone grave is, I believe, the resting place of David W. Strayhorn, born 
January 1818 and died March 11, 1849.&nbsp; He was married to Sarah Ann Teague 
Linam </br>
(Lynam)21 May 1844 in Lawrence County.&nbsp; His will was entered in the record 
in April 1849 in Lewis County.&nbsp; In his will he mentions his nephews Charles 
and </br>
Joseph McMurry, C.W. McMurry being my gr gr grandfather who married Susan 
Melissa Kelsey.</br>
</br>
Sarah Ann Teague Linam/Lynam would go on to remarry two more times (I think).</br>

<i>This cemetery listing was&nbsp; shown in the various books of the past. Mr. Fred
Lee Hawkins in the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries listed this cemetery on page 689. He visited 13 Oct 1987. Before that
it was listed in the book They Passed This way page A-153, about 1967. listed by 
Evelyn B. Shackelford &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs Herman B. Aiken.&nbsp; The
writers there interpreted the birth date as 1818. </i>
<i>Revised 31 Jul 2014 to include David W. 
Strayhorn as an adult b. 1818 d. 1849 instead of 1848 - 1849. This change is 
based on Billy Bond's information confirming the records in the book They passed 
this way..</i><CENTER>
