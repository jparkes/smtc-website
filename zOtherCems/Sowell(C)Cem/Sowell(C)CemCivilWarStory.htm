CIVIL WAR STORY</br>
</br>
</b>Mrs. Jane (King), Sowell, wife of Henry C. Sowell and who lived until 1919, told about 
the sudden appearance during the Civil War of one Dunk Cooper at their house south of Williamsport. 
He was a member of a partisan group that sought to harass the Federal forces 
from behind their lines. At the time of his visit to their home, he was trying 
to get away from the Union soldiers and was seeking protection. He hid out in 
the cellar for a time. When he decided to attempt an escape he was supplied 
with one of Mrs. Sowell's dresses and sun bonnet, put them on, picked up a water 
bucket as though he were making a trip to the spring and walked undetected right 
by the Federal troops. He kept on going past the spring, crossed Duck River into 
Greenfield Bend and made good his escape.</br>
