This quick snap shot taken (where Lancaster Cemetery will be found) as I traveled northwest on Blue Springs Road is
across the field and across Silver Creek from the Lancaster Cemetery mapping
location. Silver Creek is just where the field above meets the tree line. I was
not about to try to find this cemetery that day. Further up the road revealed
just how high the bluffs and how deep the creek was. So it would be very
difficult to ford in the winter time. This cemetery overlooks the high bluffs of
Silver Creek on the south side in a very remote area and that cemetery will as
be a very hard one to find when I get up the guts to attempt that.
