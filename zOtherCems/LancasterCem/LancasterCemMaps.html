<p align="center"><b>LANCASTER </b><b>CEMETERY,&nbsp;(Blue
Springs Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/LancasterCemRd.jpg" width="241" height="355"></br>
From Columbia follow Hwy 50 several miles and turn north (left) onto Bryant Rd.
Follow that 1 mile and turn left on Vaughn Road and you are about as close to
the cemetery as you can get by car. One way from there is to walk up the west or
south bank of Silver Creek 2/3 of a mile until you reach the cemetery.</br>

This Topographical map from MS Terra shows the location of the cemetery on a
bluff overlooking a valley where the Silver Creek flows north. You will know you
went too far along the Silver Creek bank when you are on the bluff overlooking
the creek. As you can see the cemetery is back from the bank a ways south. I
think a hand held GPS may be helpful here if you correctly plot the
Coordinates.&nbsp;</br>

<b>This aerial view shows the cemetery
where I located it as in dense forest. One can see the outline of Silver Creek
as it cuts a southern route and takes an eastern turn just north of the place of
interest. The people living in those homes at the bottom of the map may be
helpful in finding this cemetery. Especially if they are the rough and tumble
out door types. However I meet people all the time who live many years within
200 yards of a lost cemetery and they have no knowledge of it. <a href="../../AndrewsCemetery/Andrews03.html"></br>
