CEMETERY, LEE ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

This old
Topographical map dated in the 1950s shows the area of the cemetery several yards from the road and occupying
an area of square footage of ground. It is just
on the edge of another drop in elevation from the 780 foot line. Perhaps the
consequence of the new
housing development has redrawn the level of the land there and one can no
longer determine that the elevation is 780'. The Foster-Lee Cemetery is east of
the Jones-Lovett Cemetery and inside
the new development.</br>

We have marked in red the spot about where the one stone is still standing for
the Jones-Lovett cemetery. I am not plotting on this map the place for the
Foster-Lee Cemetery since it is very close to the new houses and in their yards.
In other words I have yet to find these two remaining stones.</br>
