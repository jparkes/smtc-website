<title>Foster-Lee Cemetery</title>

<p align="center"><b>FOSTER-LEE
CEMETERY, LEE ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
Called Foster Cemetery on USGS maps.
</br>
</br>
Go out Bear Creek Pike and turn north on Blackburn Rd and then turn left on
Clara Mathis Rd and then go about 2 miles and turn right on Lee Rd. Go about 500
yards and the cemetery was supposed to be on the right about 50 yards from the
lone standing stone of the Jones-Lovett Cemetery. I saw no evidence of a
cemetery but in no way am certain of this correctness.

<b>FOSTER, Lutie E., 26 Jul 1868 - 2 Dec 1880.</br>
LEE, James, 20 Apr 1874 - 6 Aug 1874. &quot;Son of J.G. &amp; M.A. Lee.&quot;</br>
</br>
Mr Fred 1986: Local residents say that Dr. &amp; Mrs. J. G. Lee were both
probably buried here but that later their bodies were removed to Rose Hill
Cemetery. There are several other graves marked by fieldstones but the cemetery
is completely abandoned and cattle have knocked many of them down.</br>
</br>
Given that information I am listing the Lee's here and also in Rose Hill where their memorial is today. From this you will know about where
Dr. &amp; Mrs. Lee lived.</br>
</br>
<u>Rose Hill Block N, Columbia Tennessee.</u></b></p>
<p><b>LEE, Dr. J. G., 24 May 1830 - 24 Dec 1904.
(removed from Foster-Lee Cem), Block &quot;N&quot;</br>
LEE, Josephine W., 8 Mar 1841 - 18 Nov 1916. (removed from Foster-Lee Cem),
Block &quot;N&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>I did not find the two stones for Lutie
Foster and James Lee and given the construction in the area I am concerned if
they will ever be found again. Further work needs to be done here on this
search. As I was photographing the adjacent Jones-Lovett Cemetery I did see
across the fence line from the there in the direction of the Foster-Lee Cemetery
bulldozer work whereby fallen stones were present that appeared to be for
graves. They appeared to be made of decorative concrete which is not a normal
material used for tombstones. They did not appear from a distance to have
inscriptions. They were at least one in number, but broken and piled up from the
dozer work in the new yard. It is possible that they were from the Foster-Lee
Cemetery which was across from the Jones-Lee graves. Because there was no proof
they were gravestones and they were piled on private land I did not examine them
further.</b></p>
