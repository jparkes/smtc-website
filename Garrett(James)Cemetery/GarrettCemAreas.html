This view looking east at the thicket shows also we are standing on a slope
dropping back to our right (south). There is one large Cedar (the dark area) and
the rest of the trees are hardwood.<br/>

This photo looks west at the stones from inside the eastern Edge of the
cemetery. <br/>
Back against the edge of the green field one can see in the view is the fence
row that is in the instructions for finding this cemetery. Down to our left is
the gate where one enters this field. <br/>
