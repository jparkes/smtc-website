From Culleoka take Mooresville Pike (HWY 373) east for three miles and turn
north onto McKnight/McKibbon Rd. When the road Forks take the McKibbon Road and
continue on to the Clyde Foster Rd. Go 300 yards past the Clyde Foster Rd and
look on the left to the Maury/Marshall County Line Signage. Park there at your
own risk and follow the Maury Marshall County Line 250 yards east/northeast.
About half way to the fence row go under the TVA Power lines and run into a
fence row. Turn south and follow the fence row and go just around the fence row
corner (Turn East) to the gate leading into a large Cow Pasture on the side of a
gentle sloping field. Go through the gate another 350 yards this time more
northeast and the cemetery is in that open field dotted with thickets. The
Cemetery is in the upper thickets of trees surrounded by the field. There are
two thickets close together. It is in the upper thicket in the upper center of
the field. Don't be confused by several smaller thickets in this field. The
cemetery is in the next to the largest thicket and there are only three large
thickets. The cemetery is in the one that is further north (our left as we
approach it.). The other thickets are just drainage soil areas covered in thick
growth. During the dry season and with permission one might be able to drive to
the cemetery. However the farmer's green pasture grasses must not be trampled
with auto tires. Above the location is pointed out in the yellow arrow pointing
south at the thicket.<br/>

Notice the cemetery is about 200 yards north of the creek and 100 yards of the
Maury/Marshall County Tennessee line just inside Maury County. The dotted lines
running north and south is the TVA Power Transmission lines. The heavy dots are
the tall Steel Power Towers. This cemetery was found at Latitude 35 Degrees
28.335W and 86 degrees 54.722. That is 200 feet to the northwest of where it was
placed on the map by Delorme mapping service.</span><b><i><br/>
