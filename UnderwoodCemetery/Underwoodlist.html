<p><i>A recent cemetery visitor
Al Studtman, the contributor of the information for this site, found two stones that were readable. There are many unmarked graves and graves marked only
with field stones in this cemetery. Mr. Fred Hawkins, author of the book &quot;Maury County
Tennessee Cemeteries&quot; was taken to this cemetery in 1987 by&nbsp; Mrs. Bette
Belle Underwood who gave him the names of others known to be buried here. These were
Willis Underwood, Mrs. Susan D. Whitington, and John Whitington. Bette also gave
Mr. Fred the names of nine others with the surname Underwood who are thought to
have been buried here and the number of unmarked graves appears to support that claim.
Researchers of the
Book &quot;They Passed This Way&quot;, Marise P. Lightfoot and J. C. Parish
mention many unmarked graves and list the same listings (shown above) as Mr Fred Hawkins.
See the above mentioned publication
Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries page
29 Volume I, listed 7 Jan 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information and photos were compiled from the photos of
Allen E. Studtman, maps, included by Wayne Austin. A few other points are from the books &quot;Maury
County Tennessee Cemeteries&quot; &amp; &quot;They Passed This Way&quot;&nbsp;
