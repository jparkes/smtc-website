<pre align="center"><b>The above photos were taken of the Underwood Cemetery by Mr. Allen E. Studtman. 
From what I can see someone is taking care of this cemetery by keeping the brush in 
check and maintaining a metal fence around the premises. Looking at the bottom photo one can 
see the pond back and to our right. Further beyond that we see the Sharp Rd in back of the pond then 
the marked points on the map included on this site are pegged a bit too far south of the actual location 
of this cemetery. The tops of many unmarked fieldstones can be seen from these photos. 
The authors of &quot;They Passed This Way&quot; Parrish &amp; Lightfoot mentioned 8-10 fieldstones. <i>
