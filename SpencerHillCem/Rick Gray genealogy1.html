<div>Wayne, Just one comment. Not sure about it but I don't think the Spencer Hill church is associated much with the cemetery anymore. I know that there is a committee over the cemetery and many of the people on the committee don't even attend church there. I know the guy over the cemetery association has grandparents buried there but has never been a member of Spencer Hill. He is a member of the church in town. I know the association is the main one in charge and have annual or bi-annual clean-ups. I will check into that for you. You may already have done that and if so just ignore my comments.</div>

<div><br/></div>Rick I have finished uploading Spencer Hill Cemetery memorials. If you are interested in any of these people interred there or want to supply any genealogy you are welcome. I think there are a few old Church of Christ Preachers there. I would like to do a better job on the history. What I have posted there does not have enough originality to stand on its own merit very well.<br/><br/><a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html">http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/SpencerHillCem/SpencerHillCemetery.html</a><br/><br/>I did get by the New Ramie Cemetery and photographed all the memorials there. The fellow who owns the land is Noel Moore my second cousin once removed. He is a retired banker but he knew my dad a lot better than I. I will publish the New Ramie Cemetery on the Internet as soon as I can get to the programming.<br/><br/>Mary Bob sent me photos on Bethel Cemetery. I don't think it is complete but I will probably use a complete list and her photos to do something there. Will focus on that next. Isn't that where you go to church?<br/><br/>Hope things are well with you<br/><br/>Wayne Austin<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Wayne Austin<br/><br/><br/><br/></blockquote></body></html>
