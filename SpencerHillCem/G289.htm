</font>GRAVES, Dora Belle
Vernon,
10 Nov 1890 - 20 Apr 1911. &quot;Wife of H. L. Graves.&quot; (</font></b><b>daughter
of John Blackburn Vernon and Lavinia Ann Pugh; 1st wife of Herbert Lee Graves)</br>
</b>The
details of this memorial are unreadable and therefore we match up this listing
from the book MCTC. That is the only Graves memorial in this cemetery against
the only Graves listing from the book. That indicates we have it right but is
not absolute proof. This stone is wet from rain and the type stone makes the
photo come out unreadable.&nbsp;</br>
