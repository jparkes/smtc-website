- 15 Feb 1886.&nbsp;<br>
and<br>
CUMMINGS/(CUMMINS), Louisa, 1817 - 10 Nov 1904.&nbsp;<br>
</b>Abner was the father of Manomey Cummins who married Rube C. Cummings - they
were 1st cousins once removed - genealogy programs show Rube as the grandnephew
of Manomey (Omey). Rube was the son of Lindsay, son of Jacob (according to
family info and a census).<b><br>
</b>
Information from 1870 Lawrence Co., Census shows Louisa and Abner's Family. From
Kenneth Warise: &quot;ELISA&quot; WAS LOUISA GRISHAM. ABNER MARRIED LOUISA, A
WIDOW WITH TWO CHILDREN, IN LAWRENCE COUNTY ON FEB. 4, 1868. Louisa's daughter,
Frances married Houston Cummins. Houston was a brother to my great-grandmother,
Manomey. Louisa Gresham Cummins was Houston's step-mother as well as his
mother-in-law. 1880 Census of Maury Co., Tn shows Louisa living with Houston and
Frances. Note from Kenneth Warise: LOUISA - WIDOW OF HOUSTON'S FATHER (ABNER)
AND MOTHER OF HIS WIFE (FRANCES). HER LISTING IN THIS CENSUS EFFECTIVELY
CONTRADICTS THE 1886 DEATH DATE ON ABNER'S TOMBSTONE. HE OBVIOUSLY DIED BEFORE
1880.<b><br>
