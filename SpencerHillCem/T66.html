WALDROP, Nannie
(Thomas), 1881 - 1926. She is clearly listed as Nannie Thomas shown here on the
tombstone or at least the part we can see. Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries has
her listed as Nannie Waldrop. Perhaps she was a Thomas married to a Waldrop.
This question needs further examination.Â <br/>
</b>This stone is immersed
in Texas Bear Grass an old plant the early settlers liked. It was brought from
Texas and can live more than a hundred years.<br/>
