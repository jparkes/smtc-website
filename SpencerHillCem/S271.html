STEWART, William,
1882 - death date not readable assuming the above date is the birth date. I
believe I see the name William Stewart stenciled with a steel punch on the last
memorial. There are </b><b>eight
concrete markers with embedded steel plates marking graves all lined up in a row
is this cemetery. The only one readable is for Mr. William Stewart detailed
above. This is an inexpensive method of creating a memorial, but evidently there
was no follow through and seven of the steel plates were not inscribed. Might I
presume these are all for the Stewart family? If you know of the details of this
family of memorials please let us know and we can list the correct information
here.</b><br/>
