&nbsp;The Bottom photo is looking into the older part of the cemetery. We are
looking northwest. The cemetery has actually expanded in burials to the east and
west from the center. Inscribed stones can be found dated as early as 1888 to
1895 across several surnames. From the top photo one can see the Spencer Hill Church
building in the distance thru the trees. These are the only two photos (made in
winter of 1992) of Spencer Hill Cemetery that I have. Most of the graves are
located back to our left.&nbsp; It was raining in March of 2004 when I was
there. Digital cameras do not make good area photos in the rain.</font><i><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
