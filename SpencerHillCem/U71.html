Unknown, This stone
is between Elbert E. Davis b. 1926 d. 1926 on our right and WF Bennett,
1890-1912.Â Not sure about that exposed rock behind this stone. It might
hold a clue to help solve this mystery. Someone has repaired this stone so there
is probably still someone living who may know the identity of the person buried
here.<br/>
