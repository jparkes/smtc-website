THOMAS, Margaret, born in about 1855 - died
~19-teens (1912 to 1920), (unmarked grave). (Margaret<br>
was the daughter of Jim Jake Thomas and Kathie Thomason who are also probably
buried in Spencer Hill in unmarked graves, but I have no precise evidence to
support that.)<br>

Note by Doug R. Baker: Somewhere in Spencer
Hill Cemetery my father�s mother�s mother is buried along with my father�s
infant brother. Their graves are not marked and I�m not real sure of the vital
statistics, but Margaret Thomas (ggrandmother) was born in about 1855 and died
~19-teens (1912 to 1920) is buried there along with Jamie Eslick Baker, born Oct
12, 1912; Died Jan 10, 1913, Infant Son of Thomas Wilson Baker and Ethel Knapp
Baker. My Dad took me there many years ago and showed me about
where he thought they were buried, but he was relying on his childhood memories
and may not have been correct.&nbsp;Douglas R. Baker, Huntsville Alabama
