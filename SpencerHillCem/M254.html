McMILLION, M.E., 22 Mar 1929 - 1 Jul 1929. <br/>
</b>Jennie &amp;
Minnie have Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral Markers well preserved. To our right and
above is the memorial inscribed by a home made artist for M.E. McMillion another
infant born in 1929 and died during the same year. I am unaware of the
relationship of M.E. to Jennie &amp; Minnie being 15 years between their
births. <br/>
