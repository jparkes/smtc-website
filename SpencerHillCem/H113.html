</b>Some photos do such a great job of capturing the background as this one surely
does. We still have all you see in the background to photograph and some not
seen to our right and left.<b> </b>It is beginning to rain and the photographer
did not drive an hour and a half to be denied photos by mother nature so I put
up the old jumbo umbrella. Now that complicates the photography as one must hold
the umbrella and make to photo also. Also the stones get wet and the photos do
not show up as well. Old well nothing stops an old military head. WA 5/21/2005<b></br>
