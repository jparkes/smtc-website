</font>CHAPMAN, Daniel Paul,
8 Dec 1978 - 15 Jan 1995. &quot;A little boy was born into this world full of
strangers. Sixteen years later loved by all who knew him. A young man left a
world filled with friends. He's not meeting friends in Heaven.&quot;</br>
</font>&nbsp;</b>Switched
to a backup Fuji Camera and unable to control the flash which&nbsp;</br>
darkens the photo and makes the wetness on the stone show up. The streaks are rain drops.
Maybe heaven too is shedding tears for these good folk?</br>
