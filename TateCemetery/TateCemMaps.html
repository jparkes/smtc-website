<b>This Map shows the GPS coordinates of the Tate Family Cemetery.
That is in the center of this map at the end of that unimproved (dotted line) road. I have not 
visited this cemetery to confirm these Coordinates. </b><br/>

From Santa Fe Pike, turn up (right on) Snow Creek Rd. Go two miles. Enter (turn 
left) the farm road that goes beside the barn on the place now (1987) occupied 
by David Hawkins (old Goad place). The cemetery is on the hill about 1/4 mile 
beyond the barn.</b><b><br/>

I have marked the spot the GPS points as the cemetery with a red check. Even 
when generally known to be correct the GPS has errors up to 50 yards so I think 
the cemetery will probably be found under the clump of trees where I placed a 
red question mark.</b>  </p>
