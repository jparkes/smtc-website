This cemetery is not easy to find. It is in the woods and hidden from view until 
approached very closely. Listed on 6 Feb 1987 in the book Maury County Tennessee 
Cemeteries, by Fred Lee Hawkins, page 194.<br/>

<br/>
TATE, Nancy. "Old mother, a relict of the past has passed away; she saw these 
valleys change from cane breaks to happy farms; she lived near Santa Fe." Paper 
dated 26 Feb 1875. (Orange Co., N.C. marriage bond; George Tate to Nancy Strain 
[Strayhorn?], 4 Dec 1813.)<br/>
<br/>
TATE, Miss Cora, "27, died in Marshall Co., 22 Nov 1896 of consumption." "Died 
Mon., near Belfast, age 27; buried in family burying ground near Santa Fe; she 
was the 9th member of the Tate family who has died in last 7 years, 3 having 
died in a month of typhoid." (Paper dated 26 Nov 1896) --from They Passed This 
Way, Vol. 1), p. 197. Note: There seems to be some confusion in this obituary. 
The deaths mentioned occurred in 1853, which was 43 years prior to the death of 
Miss Cora Tate. (See note below.)<br/>
<br/>
Note the seven persons who died within a two month period in 1853. These were 
victims of typhoid fever, or so says tradition. It is interesting that seven 
members of the Webb family (buried in Zion Cemetery) and four or five of the 
Blackman family (see Blackman Cemetery) also died during this same period. Also 
the Odil family of spring Hill was nearly all wiped out with this particularly 
deadly strain. Also you may suspect many other death dates of 1853 among members of large families 
around the county.<br/>

SNOW CREEK - 
"This is one of the main creeks in Maury County, with headwaters near Theta, it 
flows south and enters the Duck River a little upstream from Leipers Creek. It 
was named by a party of surveyors who were overtaken by a very early &amp; deep 
snow. As early as 1823 there was a school located on the creek, and possibly 
earlier. Snow Creek post office was established in 1830 and was the first postal 
service for today's Santa Fe. Place names along the creek include: Dark Hollow, 
Pennywinkle Hollow, Petty Hollow, George Hollow, Walters Hollow, Sutherland 
Hollow, Gaskill Branch, Fitzgerald Branch, Sowell Branch, and Mingo Branch."
