This map showing the latest technology from ACME Mapper 2.0 shows the outline of 
the cemetery which I have marked with a yellow boundary. Also the corrected GPS 
is: N 35.72635 X W 86.88177. Map revised 11 Mar 2013<i><br/>

Revised directions now is go north on I-65 and take the 
Saturn Parkway Exit and go west on Hwy 396 to Port Royal Road. Exit to the south 
(right then left) there and go south on Port Royal Road to Derryberry Lane which 
is a left turn (east). Next follow that and when it bends north back to become 
the Worthington Lane follow that 2 tenths of a mile and look to your right 
(east) and the cemetery is almost next to the road behind a chain link fence. <i>
Revised Instructions dated 11 Mar 2013</i><br/>
</b><b>Old 
Instructions: From Spring
Hill, take Port Royal Rd. Just before reaching Port Royal Presbyterian Church
enter left into a farm lane and go 1 mile further. Cemetery is on Willis Brown
place, between house and barn adjacent to the old Blair home which has recently
been razed to make way for a new road. The new road which is probably in place
now (2009) causes the cemetery to be on the east side of that.</b></center><b>

 This is an
exploded now historical aerial map of the area showing the cemetery pointed out by the yellow
arrow. The old Blair Home can be seen above. This aerial image was made before
the road was cut thru there and the home bulldozed. The cemetery has a new chain
link fence surrounding it.<i><br/>
