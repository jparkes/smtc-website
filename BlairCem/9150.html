Fountain E., 13 Dec 1847 - 2 Dec 1859. As you can see the above stone states the
death date year as 1850. I can clearly see a 9 in the death year in the old
stone. I am assuming this stone was made up from the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries which I believe was wrong on stating the death year date as 1850. My
conclusion is that the death year is 1859. You be the judge by studying the
large photo above.Â </span><i><br/>
