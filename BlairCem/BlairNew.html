This large monument was added recently to replace all he failing original
monuments in the cemetery. There are a few differences I was unable to find a separate
stone for Laura Caroline Blair. Nor was I able to confirm that James Exum Glenn
was interred here in spite of all the evidence in written records. <b><a href="BlairCemSign.html">The
