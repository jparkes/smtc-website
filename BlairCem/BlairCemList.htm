cemetery.)</p>

<p align="center"><b>George D. Blair</b></p>

<p align="left">George D. Blair was one of the early settlers in the area just east of (old) Spring
Hill and south of the Williamson</br>
County line. He was a prosperous farmer and was active in church and community
affairs. When the citizens of the</br>
vicinity decided to build a church, Mr. Blair gave a nice lot upon which to
erect the building. He or his descendents also gave the land for the family
cemetery. The cemetery was about 100 yards south of the old Blair home, located
in what was then Brittain, Tn. The home was
recently bulldozed (late 2008) to make way for a new road to accommodate the new
development of the Spring Hill area..</p>

<p align="center"><b>History of Brittain (now called
Port Royal)</b></p>

<p align="left">Brittain was at one time located about three
miles east of Spring Hill but would today be located between Spring Hill &amp;
I-65 on the Jim Warren Road. It was also very near the Williamson County line.
This same
area was later also partly known as Port Royal and still is today.&nbsp; The name Brittain was the name of an old
prominent house
there which was razed&nbsp; in late 2008 to make way for the fast paced development
in the Spring Hill area.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
 This section of Maury County once had a post office (closed in
1903) and was originally settled in the early 1800s by a South Carolina
pioneers, including Samuel Dunlap, George D.
Blair, Samuel Stephenson, Philip Chapman, the Dudleys, and others. James
Lockridge (1757-1840) is said to have lived nearby at one time. James was one of
Maury County's veterans of the American Revolution War who fought to free land
from the tyranny of British rule. The first church here was a
union church on land donated by George D. Blair (1787-1876). Later this church
became a Presbyterian church, then eventually (after 1975 &amp; before 2008) was
converted to a private
property. It still stands today.</br>
</br>
The Blair home, called Brittain, was built of logs in 1812. George D. Blair had
married a cousin of Andrew Jackson's, Elizabeth Stephenson Crawford. Later when
the house was covered by weatherboarding and decorative detail added to the
front, Mrs. George D. Blair designed and sawed the detail herself. Brittain was
still owned by Blair the descendants in 1975 whose surname is Harris.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
Six weeks before Andrew Jackson's death in 1845, the Blairs' rode horseback to
the Hermitage in Nashville to visit her famous but ailing kinsman.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
During the Civil War 1861-1865, this section of Maury County saw much activity particularly
from the action around Glenn's Store and Rally Hill, not far away. Wilson's
Union cavalry was here many times. In the fall of 1864 the Confederate Army was
on Rutherford Creek and the woods were alive with soldiers and skirmishers.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
At least one school was here, Greenwood School built in 1894. Today nothing
remains to remind us of the place called Brittain except the Blair Cemetery and
a few old Cedar trees. The Port Royal Church on what is today the Jim Warren
Road has been converted to a private residence.&nbsp; Several years ago an old
millstone was still in the front yard at Brittain (the Blair home). This was
probably the stone from Blair's Mills, which was flourishing in 1844. The mill
was also the location of a voting precinct.&nbsp;</p>

Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, by Fred Lee Hawkins, Jr. page 131-132.
Revised for information the survey and photography discovered 24 Feb 2009.&nbsp;
