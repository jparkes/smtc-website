most of inscriptions are still largely readable in this cemetery we can see from
this photo the sad shape of the original memorials. These are old &amp; very
soft limestone &amp; other stone monuments that are breaking and crumbling at a
rapid rate. This photo was taken by pointing the camera across the cemetery
southwest.<b> <br/>
