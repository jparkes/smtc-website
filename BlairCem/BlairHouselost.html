This large mound of debris is what remains of the historical home once called
Brittain founded in 1812 by George D. Blair and his wife Mary Stephenson
Crawford Blair. Mary was a cousin of Andrew Jackson.&nbsp;</br>
The new road can be seen as a red bank of dirt spanning northeast/southwest just beyond the debris. It
will run on the west side of the Blair Cemetery. Blair Cemetery is located just a few hundred feet behind
and to the south of where the photographer stands shooting northward.<b></br>

This old photo was made of the Blair home later owned by the Harris family. It was once known as Brittain
when still in its prime. It is said Mary Blair (1788 - 1858) sawed the
ornamental wood carvings on the front of the house with her own hands. In the
south we see the Blair name come up again and again in olden historical times as
prominent people. The Blair surname was prevalent in northern Alabama where
large families &amp; homes, farm &amp; entrepreneurial endeavors, educational
&amp;
religious intuitions abounded and were favorably influenced by their efforts.&nbsp;</span><i></br>
