Laura Caroline, 1825 - 1863. I wonder if this is the same listing as Adra M.
Blair. At least the year dates are the same. I was unable to verify this listing
using the original stones &amp; listings from this cemetery. The listing may
have come from other records such as a family Bible and Laura lies under one of
the several fieldstone markers here.</span><i></br>
