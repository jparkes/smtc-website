were early inhabitants and founders of Columbia Tennessee. Moses Chaffin was a
Flat Boat owner and operator who died in a storm on the Mississippi River while

Commentary in 1988 by Fred Hawkins:<br>
These were once large box tombs but the tops are now flat on the ground and
almost hidden in the dirt. A couple of large trees mark the spot of these
graves. In fact, one of them has enclosed a good part of one of the slabs.</font></p>
