MEMORIAL GARDENS - MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE&nbsp;</br>
</br>
The telephones screamed in the recently expanded Maury County Hospital on a
beautiful June day in 1977.</br>
Phone call after phone call, body after body streamed into the hospital. People
shouted. A smoky smell lingered in the emergency room. Nurses came to work in
anticipation of a lazy afternoon and left covered in soot.</br>
One 22-year-old nursing tech helped man the telephones that day. She had worked
as a desk clerk for a year, but June 26, 1977, marked her first day working as a
nurse tech. She wouldn't graduate with a nursing degree until three years later.</br>
The event remains vivid in Patsy Smotherman's mind, as well as the minds of many
others in the community. The fire, started by a 16-year-old runaway from
Wisconsin, filled the Maury County Jail with smoke, killed 42 inmates and
prompted international media coverage.</br>
It all started for Smotherman with a phone call from Freddie Rich, who at the
time served as assistant director of the ambulance service and now serves as
director.</br>
&quot;I am bringing in a 16-year-old kid with some burns,&quot; Smotherman
recalled Rich saying.</br>
He gave his report, ending with &quot;Oh yeah, there will be about 40-plus more
coming in.&quot;</br>
