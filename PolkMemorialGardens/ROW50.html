MEMORIAL GARDENS - MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE <br/>
<br/>
The telephones screamed in the recently expanded Maury County Hospital on a
beautiful June day in 1977.<br/>
Phone call after phone call, body after body streamed into the hospital. People
shouted. A smoky smell lingered in the emergency room. Nurses came to work in
anticipation of a lazy afternoon and left covered in soot.<br/>
One 22-year-old nursing tech helped man the telephones that day. She had worked
as a desk clerk for a year, but June 26, 1977, marked her first day working as a
nurse tech. She wouldn't graduate with a nursing degree until three years later.<br/>
The event remains vivid in Patsy Smotherman's mind, as well as the minds of many
others in the community. The fire, started by a 16-year-old runaway from
Wisconsin, filled the Maury County Jail with smoke, killed 42 inmates and
prompted international media coverage.<br/>
It all started for Smotherman with a phone call from Freddie Rich, who at the
time served as assistant director of the ambulance service and now serves as
director.<br/>
"I am bringing in a 16-year-old kid with some burns," Smotherman
recalled Rich saying.<br/>
He gave his report, ending with "Oh yeah, there will be about 40-plus more
coming in."<br/>
