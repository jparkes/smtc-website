</b><b>The Cheairs
Plantation Home (Rippavilla) &amp; Cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
</b>
Go south of Spring Hill a mile or so and turn left into the Rippavilla (old
Cheairs) Plantation home lane. You probably will want to tour the home, but also
stop and get
permission &amp; instructions to visit the cemetery. The cemetery is about a
mile behind and to the east of the home, along the road, as you pass other historical
sites. All this is part of a grand historic tour. The plantation home is one of the most
historic sites in middle Tennessee. It was purchased as a part of the land
holdings of the Saturn Automobile Plant by GM,  but may have been spun off since the original transaction.<br/>
