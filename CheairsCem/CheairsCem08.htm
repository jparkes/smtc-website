This photo is of the large area where the Haynes Haven re-interments were laid
after they were removed from the site of the giant Automotive plant. They put in
place one memorial.</br>

The new monument to those unknown souls, see below. It is likely most of these
folks were slaves but could be anyone's ancestor.<Br>

Inscribed as follows:</br>
&quot;Here lies persons unknown removed from Haynes Haven land, reinterred with
reverence at this site this 10th day of Nov. 1986.&quot; In the process of
excavating the site for the new Saturn plant, workers discovered the remains of
several persons who had been buried in unmarked graves on the Haynes Haven
property. The Company removed the remains to this site, on the other side of
Highway 31, and reinterred them beside the old Cheairs Cemetery. Space was left
for any other such remains that might be found in the area. Due to the large
number of fieldstones scattered about there evidently were already a number of
graves marked without inscribed stones.</br>
