The rock wall enclosure of the Cheairs Cemetery in front of the unmarked graves

We are looking at an old slave cabin which was used prior to 1865 for
inhabitation by a slave family. It is likely there would have been several of
these around the property, but of log construction. This one is just north of
the cemetery up the road. This has no paint as that was the norm in those days.
The Oak clap boards here are very durable and if covered properly with a good
roof do no need to have paint to preserve them.<br>
We are impinging on one of the tour relics of the Rippavilla Plantation home
here so go by there and see that first hand as we have not touched on what is available
there.&nbsp; People of all heritages will appreciate the history and what they
are doing to preserve American heritage &amp; history.</font><font size="2"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>
