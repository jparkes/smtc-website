The little tiny stone far out with the tall shoulders and pointed top. Appears
to be a child's marker or a footstone of a grave. However, as a footstone it
does not match any of the headstones in style nor is there any sign of an
inscription on it. So it probably marks the foot of a grave with the headstone
missing, disintegrated, or sunken into the ground. Generally this style of stone
was used from about 1815 to about 1850.<br/>
