Soldier, born in Virginia &amp; served during the Revolutionary War. He came to 
Maury County by 1814 and settled southwest of Columbia. He is the or least

the confederate side. Three of his descendents met an unfortunate death at the 
hands of self style murderers with sympathies unlike their own. This was a time 
of lawlessness in the south with the Guerilla War continuing the conflict. All 
this happened shortly after the military conflict ended in 1865. William &amp;
