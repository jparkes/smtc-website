</B><b>&nbsp;From I-65, Exit 53 going west on Saturn Parkway 
toward Spring Hill take the first exit to the right which is Port Royal Road Exit and go 
north (or right) about 2 tenths of a mile and turn right on Old Port Royal Road 
which is now a dead end street. Follow that almost to the end of the street. The 
cemetery is on your right about 200 yards SE in a grove of trees. There is a storage building business 
due west of the cemetery and you will be behind the last business on the south 
side of the street. Old North Port Royal Road dead ends about 150 yards 
before it reaches the Saturn Parkway. You should be able to view the cemetery in the 
distance after you scale the bank of the road assuming the grounds are 
still maintained. Park and walk west but veer toward the south until you 
are behind the third building &amp; you will see the cemetery across a line 
of trees and in a stand of trees southeast of you. The stones are tiny and so many 
of them are fallen the cemetery is not highly visible.</b><B></br>

The red check points out the location of the cemetery. Here you can see the 
exits of Saturn parkway and the three businesses along N. Old Port Royal Rd.</br>

Here we have a better image of the location of the cemetery under the tall trees marked with a red check. 
It is past the first line of trees into a round clump of trees. Today there are 
only three trees in that clump.</br>
