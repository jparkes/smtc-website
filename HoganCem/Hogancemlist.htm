* John Hogan Married Elizabeth Payne Daughter of Daniel And Nancy Paine Paine,
Daniel And Nancy were First Cousins.&nbsp; John And Elizabeths were known to
have Eleven Children. [note from Rose Higgins a Hogan Cemetery researcher.]</br>
</br>
* John Hogan and Josiah Hogan are buried in the same grave. they died at the
same time. I don't know how, but I figure it was an illness as there was a black
tongue plague during that time. This new information also matches the headstone
rubbings. The rubbings show information on two different people but only partial
information could be gleaned from the rubbing. [note from Rose Higgins a Hogan
Cemetery researcher.]</br>
</br>
This graveyard was once larger without a doubt. I was unable to find any field
stones standing. A neighbor told me that some years ago, when the area was being
prepared for farming, the bulldozer hit at least one stone before the operator
even knew the cemetery was here. This might have
been the stone for John Hogan, which is now broken. or one that I could not
find.</br>

Graves marked with fieldstones: None were found
&amp; Fred Hawkins said there were none when he was there in 1988.</br>
