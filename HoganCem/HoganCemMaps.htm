CEMETERY (Stiversville

The blue pointer
shows where the cemetery is actually located as opposed to where this GPS detail
says it is located. The corrected GPS is 35 degrees 26.4924' X 54 degrees
3.3734'.</br>

Here we can see
the major roads needed to travel to this cemetery. Directions: From Stiversville on Highway 31 turn west onto road to Southport. Go one and
a half miles. Along this 1 and 1/2 miles follow the road up the incline and then
down the other side and around the curve. When the road straightens out go to
the second Drive and the cemetery is behind that house. This was the Lonnie Ingram
place in 1987. The cemetery is in the thicket behind a new modular house, but
the owner had plans to clear the cemetery. The above map shows the cemetery down
too close to the creek to be correct. It is actually located just a few hundred
feet northwest of where it is pegged on this map.</p>

Notice in this close in Aerial view the clump of trees where the cemetery is located on
the north side of Stiversville Road. It is behind a Modular house which blends
in with the terrain and is hard to see on this map, but we have it pointed out.<i></br>
