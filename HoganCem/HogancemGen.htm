Thanks Rose Higgins for allowing me to converse. Greetings Wayne Austin. I am a
1st cousin to Fred Lee Hawkins, His Mother and my Father were Brother And
Sister, He has a son living in Columbia,&nbsp; or did when Mr. Fred passed away,
Fred did much research and transcriptions of Cemeteries in Maury County. <font color="#800000">[Now
thats an understatement WA 25 May 2010]</font></p>
<p>The three readable stones are part of mine and Freds Family. Namely from
Daniel Payne and His Wife Nancy Paine/Payne, (Spelling presented as Each Person
Used)</p>
<p>As I related to Rose Saturday, Daniel And Nancy Were First Cousins Their
Daughter Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Payne married John Hogan, Their daughter
Mary Jane is The third proven burial here.<br>
<br>
By the way Wayne, Daniels folks, most of them went on to Missouri and Arkansas
from Maury County. His Sister Catherine Paine married Samuel Austin who is
buried in Hazlewood Cemetery In Missouri, Catherine is buried somewhere in Burke
County N. C. If you connect there you could have a touch of Payne in you. <i><font color="#800000">[Note
by Wayne Austin: No Toney I have accounted for all my recent ancestry in Maury
County and so maybe this Samuel Austin connects back in Burk County N.C., but
not in Maury County. Last ancestor I had about the age of Samuel is a Drewy
Austin 1855 - 1831, who was from Anson County N.C. and died in Lincoln Co Tn.
W.A. 25 May 2010. Those two guys could be brothers or cousins, but I don't info
that connects them. ]</font></i><br>
<br>
Thanks Rose for the contact. You have no idea how many John Paynes there are.
About every generation in every family, Named their children after their
brothers,&nbsp;<br>
Thanks<br>
Toney Payne.<br>

I found a will of John's father &quot;David&quot; leaving his property to his
youngest son Wiley. It is dated 1834. also, I have been examining the census
records and comparing them to the headstone of John Hogan. I believe John Henry
and his brother Josiah are buried together behind my house in the Hogan Cemetery
without headstones. According to census records, John's son &quot;John&quot; was
born in 1830. The only one born 1810 is his brother Josiah and it shows them
dying the same time and Josiah was 33 at his time of death. The top of the stone
definitely says &quot;John&quot; and his information plus some of Josiah. I am
going to try and do another rubbing this evening and see if I can get the stone
to read better. If this proves to be true, the Hogans who are shown as died in
Stiversville, Maury County, Giles County, and Hogan Cemetery during that
timeframe are probably all in my back yard. I originally thought the graveyard
was the immediate family of John Henry Hogan but now it is appearing it is of
his family coming from his father David. David might also be buried there as he
died in the timeframe as well.</font></p>
