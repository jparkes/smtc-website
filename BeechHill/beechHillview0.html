We are looking at a drawing of the old original Beech Hill Church of Christ building
built in 1897 near Mt Pleasant
Tennessee. This is drawn from a photo made in 1930 of the Beech Hill
building.  My (Rick's) daughter Noelle drew this for our homecoming one year. We
had a bad photo of it and she did the pencil drawing from that photo. The
building is supposed to be the original building built in 1897. It remains part
of the building today. It has been added too through the years but the actual
worship area is part of the original building. Drawing by Noelle, the daughter of Rick Gray,
2003.<br/>
