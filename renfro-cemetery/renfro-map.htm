&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This
is a TOPO map of the Renfro Cemetery location. All the maps I know have the
cemetery incorrectly located about 500 yards to the east of the actual cemetery above.
The incorrect Latitude - Longitude or GPS coordinates of N </b>35.47841 and W
-86.94667<b> plotted by the USGS. The corrected Latitude - Longitude or GPS
coordinates of N 35.47843 and W -86.95627 were plotted by using MS Streets &amp;
