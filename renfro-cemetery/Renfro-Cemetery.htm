font-family:Arial;color:navy">Renfro Cemetery may be found by taking Mooresville
Pike east out of Culleoka for a mile &amp; a half and turning left on Fred Sharpe
Road and traveling 1/2 mile to a locked gate. Climb up the steep tree
covered hill on your left and follow the ridge about 500 yards to the top. Cemetery is there
among the large trees and a bit hard to find in the summer time when the leaves
are out. The cemetery is quite historic and very old with many stone now sunken
below the ground and temporarily lost. The Revolutionary War Veteran William
Renfro and his family are interred there. The photos supplied by the author here
were not taken with enough care to capture this cemetery as I
normally do. My visit there 11-1-03 was only brief but long enough to take a
few quick photos and listen to the narrator Charles Hinson conduct a
Historical Society Cemetery tour.&nbsp;</br>

My name is John Renfro. I am a descendent of the Renfros' buried in Renfro
Cemetery at Culleoka. If you know of other descendents familiar with the
cemetery I would appreciate you giving them my e-mail address. They can contact
me at <a title="mailto:vet1@bellsouth.net" href="mailto:vet1@bellsouth.net">vet1@bellsouth.net</a>.
Thank you for your time and effort in helping me tie up some loose ends. <i>John</i></h1>
