<b>This is a layout of what some of the descendents in 1962 found at the Renfro
Cemetery. Many of these stones are not visible today but are believed to be there an inch or so
under the leaves and topsoil.&nbsp; The number above is keyed to the following
list:&nbsp;<br>
( 1) &amp; (2) Unknown due to no (or worn off) inscription</b></font><b><font color="#800000"  size="2">.&nbsp;<br>
( 3) Sarah Jane Toombs. Wife of W. W. Toombs and Daughter of William &amp; Eliza
Renfro. (Toumbs and Toombs are same surname used interchangeably. The stones
here spell it with the &quot;u&quot; but the most widely recognized spelling is
with two &quot;o&quot;s.&nbsp;<br>
( 4) Sarah Jane, Infant Daughter of W. W. &amp; Jane (Renfro) Toombs.&nbsp;<br>
( 5) William Renfro, 1734 - 1830, Revolutionary War Veteran.&nbsp;<br>
( 6) Jane Renfro, died June 2, 1830. Age 79 yrs. Consort of William
Renfro.&nbsp;<br>
</font></b><b><font color="#800000"  size="2">( 7) William
Renfro son of William and Jane. Spouse of Eliza A.&nbsp;<br>
( 8) Eliza A. (Crafton) Renfro, wife of William.&nbsp;<br>
( 9) Narcissa E. Renfro, daughter of William and Eliza, 1835 - 1848.&nbsp;<br>
(10) Barclay M. Renfro, 1840 - 1862.&nbsp;<br>
(11) Rebecca Renfro, 1819 - 1875, wife of William&nbsp;<br>
(12) Not readable during 1962.&nbsp;<br>
(13) Delia R. Renfro, 1824 - 1872, wife of James Shelburn Renfro.&nbsp;<br>
(14) Sarah Renfro, Infant daughter of William &amp; Eliza.&nbsp;<br>
(15) William J. (or S.) Renfro, stone read in 1962. Sunken below in the ground
by 1965.&nbsp;<br>
(16) William Renfro, son of William &amp; Eliza, </font></b><b><font color="#800000"  size="2">stone
read in 1962. Sunken below in the ground by 1965.</font></b><b><font color="#800000"  size="2"><br>
(17) Lucretia Killingsworth, 1769 - 1846.&nbsp;<br>
(18) - (22) are burials under the surname Foster and were either not detailed by
the descendents or the stones were not readable. There are no visible readable
stones today with Foster Surname. They might be there but have sunken below the
ground a few inches.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of field stone markers that probably
mark the graves of the former slaves of the Renfro family. A few of them are
crudely inscribed with markings such as: 1870; 1877; Carlen; 1895; Ida 1882;
L.N.S.H.; 1914; 6 Mos.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persons that were the contributors of the listing of
the cemetery and subsequent drawing above in 1962 are Josie &amp; Delia Biard,
Zola Miller, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. R. L. Calvert. I used the hand written drawing
and converted it to the above graphic. This information and drawing
are shown with permission from the records of descendents Everett Renfro and Charles Hinson.
Confirmed on
Nov 1, 2003 during a Maury County Historical Society Cemetery Excursion whereby
a tour was given of Renfro Cemetery. The large
rectangular areas above are box tombs and the small ones are small box tombs. The
slender rectangles are the typical upright stones of the early to mid 1800s. <i>Graphics
