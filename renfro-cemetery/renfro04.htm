<b><font size="2" color="#800000">05-RENFRO, Wm., (14 May) 1734 - (1 Sep) 1830, 
(Henry Co. Va. native; d. in Culleoka, Maury co. Tn.; s/o William R. Renfro 1702 
- 1789 and Elizabeth Cheney Renfro 1704 - abt 1756 Va.; h/o (1) Chloe, their 
children, Peter, John Lydia, Jane, Moses, Jesse and Nancy, (2) h/o Jane Gregory, 
their child, William Renfro Jr. b. 31 Jan 1797 in Union Co. S. C. d. 6 Oct 1846

&quot;for militia duty since the fall of Charleston in Blandon's Regiment of 
Anderson's Return.&quot; Renfro was living in SC in 1799 when his youngest child was 
born. In 1811 he paid taxes on 100 acres of land on Fountain Creek in Maury

<b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Name scratched in the top of large box tomb beside
tomb of Jane, below. A veteran of the Revolutionary War. (Box
tomb). Others believe that the box tomb had an inscription at one time. I will
get in trouble for this statement but I believe it was never inscribed. Not to
inscribe a tomb was a common practice in 1830 The stone just looks too solid and 
square for the inscription to have been worn or peeled away. We do however have 
an attempt by one of the descendents to fashion the name in the stone. We can be 
thankful for the Renfro family who maintained and passed info down from one 
generation to another that this is in fact the tomb of William Renfro. In that 
case I must also say thanks to the Renfro descendents that kept up with this 
cemetery and preserved its history though they may not have been able to restore 
the cemetery. <br>
