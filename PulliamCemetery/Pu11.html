</b><center><b>WORTHAM,
Elizabeth A., 11 Aug 1832 - _ _ _ _1834. 2 yrs -??-1 day, 'Daughter of John B.
&amp; Mary Wortham.' This little box tomb probably belongs to Elizabeth. It is
not large enough for an adult. Just a corner of the top is all that is visibly
lying around and that is on our left. The rest of the top is probably under the
topsoil nearby. There is a name on that part of the top but I believe it belongs
to the stone carver. It is not discernable by me.&nbsp;</br>
