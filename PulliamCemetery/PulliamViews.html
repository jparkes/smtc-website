is a labeled view looking southwest from the northwest corner. As you can see
there is no grass in this cemetery. The cows keep it down. Also brush is lying
around from fallen trees which have been damaged by the bark being eaten away.
This is a sad way to treat an old historic cemetery and I am sure the owners get
into lax habits because of public apathy and lack of attention by the public in
understanding what is there. I think the only solution is to move all the
cemetery assets to a common location and leave behind one impenetrable stone
with the interred listings on that. Then most of the ground can be returned back
to the farmer. The graves moved can then have the accompanying stones set in
place and properly maintained by a common caretaker with a full time
interest.Â <br/>

</i>This view looking back northeast from the southwest corner. The two stone in
the background for Louis &amp; William Wortham are actually in a long row of
graves that is about the only complete row in the cemetery. Other stones are set
apart in different places and I assume the graves are aligned the same way.
These graves are facing east in the traditional Christian way.<br/>
