</font></font><b>One
is able to see the route I took by following due north from the cemetery pointer
to a place of entrance across Bear Creek entering a private residential driveway
that bends eastward. That still leaves a 400 yard walk back behind an old barn,
across two fence rows (that cannot be seen in the above aerial view) and up the
slope to the top of the hill where the cemetery can be found. It is in a thicket
of trees surrounded by a pasture. That pasture is surrounded by forest and an
old fence row on the west as can be seen in the above aerial view. The GPS
coordinates above are correct as far as I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
