Sam C Daimwood on the same stone with Henry Burton Daimwood. One uses the D on
the end of the initials and Henry's footstone just has H.B. Hmmm! I wonder if
Henry is not a Daimwood, but the brother of Annie Burton Daimwood, wife of Sam
W. Daimwood??</br>

<b>Henry Burton Daimwood memorial fallen from its
base.&nbsp;</br>
This is on the opposite side on the same stone with Samuel C. Daimwood. (I left it face
up)
</br>
</br>
DAIMWOOD, Henry Burton, 1854 - 1894.</br>
</br>
There is no mention of the surname Daimwood in the main inscription here. I am assuming
that the stone was inscribed on the base as DAIMWOOD and I failed to notice
that. Right or wrong previous researchers assumed the same.&nbsp;There is
evidence shown above that this may be just the name Henry Burton. Annie Burton Daimwood,
wife of Sam. W. Daimwood may have been this guy's sister. Notice the footstone
above with the initials H. B. and the other footstone above with the initial
S.C.D.&nbsp;</br>
