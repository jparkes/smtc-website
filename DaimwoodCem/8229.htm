<b>The H. B. (Henry Boone) Daimwood husband of
Elizabeth J. Daimwood memorial. It was buried under three inches of soil and I
did not have my shovel so I used the cedar log shown here to dig and pry it up.
Whew! As you can see I had nothing to clean it with either. Hey, I am a
photographer not an archeologist or an anthropologist. HA!</br>
