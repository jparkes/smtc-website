<b>Would you know this thicket contained an old
historic graveyard as you approached it from down the hill? It is too high above
us to see the memorial stones located in there. Also the memorials are mostly
fallen to the ground. <br/>
There are some clear indications of that. First (1) it is an enclosed abandoned
area that surrounding landowners don't know what to do with. They can't find the
time nor have the knowledge to maintain it as you and I should. It is surrounded
by pasture on all sides and is the highest elevation in that pasture at about
700 feet above sea level. (2) The vegetative growth is dense and fast growing
indicating the soil has been disturbed (graves dug here). This causes the plant
growth to spring up more quickly and profusely. (3) It is in an upland area
where the pioneers who were looking for a grave site realized the spot was well
drained and made for great preservation.<br/>
Since I left my GPS in the car as I neared this place these and other indicators
told me I had found the graveyard before I spotted the first stone.<i> </i>
If you do this recognize this is private ground and needs permission, but most 
land owners are friendly enough to allow proper visitors access. Others - well 
be prepared for a fight if this is your ancestral ground.<i><br/>
