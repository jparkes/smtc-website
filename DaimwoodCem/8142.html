The largest monument in the cemetery lies tumbled to the southwest. The base is
furtherest on the left followed by the shaft and next the top ornaments.

This is the best take I can offer for getting the year dates correctly. The only
thing visible to me was the gray part. The rest was buried under the soil and I
had no digging equipment. I believe I have it right so he was born 1812 and died
during 1850. It is possible the death date is 1859, 1856 or maybe even 1860
though. No researcher has published this date before as this stone was lying
face down.
