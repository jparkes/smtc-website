This little footstone is all I found of the H.B. Daimwood, 1870-1893. It is east
of the Holly memorials and is not be confused with the fallen and broken
memorial for H.B. Daimwood b. 1814 memorial as that is located north of this
place down the same row. If one were to probe for the headstone it could be
found as previous researchers detailed it I believe. Nor is this to be confused
with the Henry Burton or Henry Burton Daimwood memorial as that is southwest of
this row.</br>
