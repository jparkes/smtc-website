<b>Unknown, this is one of many fieldstones that
are marking graves. This one clearly does because there is a head &amp;
footstone, both being fieldstones standing up on their end and both buried about
half way down. This is between the Butler and Daimwood area. I believe the stone
to the left of this stone is actually the headstone. That is consistent with the
rows in this graveyard. <i><br/>
