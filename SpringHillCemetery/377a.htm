<br>
On last Wednesday morning, May 17, the immortal spirit of Mr. Benjamin T. 
Cowsert forsook its earthly tenement and wound its way to &quot;a land that is fairer 
than day.&quot; For many months he had suffered, but God was with him, and patience, 
submission and cheerfulness were his through all. His stay upon earth was longer 
than that usually allotted to man, he being in his 74th year. He was a member of 
the Cumberland Presbyterian church in Spring Hill, and lived a quiet christian 
life, striving ever to be of use to those around him. Funeral services were 
conducted at the residence by Revs. Taylor and Hardin, and were most appropriate 
and comforting. The host of loving friends who gathered to pay the last sad 
tribute to his memory, attest the esteem in which he was held. the remains were 
interred in Spring Hill cemetery next to those of his wife, who preceded him to 
the grave seven years ago. Besides a host of relatives and friends, he leaves 
five daughters surviving him, viz: Mrs. Robert Orman, Mrs. Joe Parham, of Spring 
Hill, Mrs. Jeff Martin [sic, Marlin], of Boston, Tenn.; Mrs. Gip Dodson, Enon 
Creek, and Mrs. Lee Langley, with whom he lived, near this place. To the 
bereaved ones we extend our heart-felt sympathy and bid them look up, and see in 
this loss their loved one's gain, for he is resting with &quot;the saints in glory.&quot; 
-- Columbia Herald, 26 May, 1899.<br>
