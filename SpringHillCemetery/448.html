Enon Creek, Oct. 4 - It is with the most profound regret that we chronicle the 
death of Mrs. Bettie Harmon Grigsby, wife of Mr. E. B. Grigsby, of Spring Hill, 
who died Sept. 28th[*], in the 34th year of her age. Deceased had been a 
sufferer for the past two years with that dreadful disease, consumption, but 
bore her sufferings without a murmur. During her sickness she often spoke of 
death, saying that she was not afraid to die and was willing and ready to go to 
the Master's call; but all she regretted was leaving her four little children. 
Funeral services were conducted by her pastor, Rev. T. A. Hardin, in the 
Presbyterian church at Spring Hill, and her remains were laid to rest by hands 
of reverent love, in the Spring Hill grave-yard. She was a member of the Port 
Royal church, and in her death the church loses one of its most faithful 
members; kind, gentle, and charitable, and of a lovable disposition, she 
endeared herself to everyone whom she met, and those who loved her in life now 
revere her in death. She leaves a husband, four small children, a mother, seven 
brothers, one sister, and a large circle of relatives to mourn her untimely 
death. Mrs. Grigsby was a sister to Mr. J. D. Harmon, of Columbia. We extend our 
sympathies to the bereaved ones in their sadness. -- Columbia Herald, 08 Oct. 
1897.<br/>
