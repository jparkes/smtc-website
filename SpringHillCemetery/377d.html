Mrs. Mary J. Caperton died last Sunday at her home near Spring Hill. Deceased 
had been seriously ill for only a few days, although her heard had been quite 
feeble for several years. The funeral services were conducted at the residence 
Monday by Rev. Mr. Hardin, assisted by Revs. Taylor, Dixon and Fuller, and the 
interment took place in the Spring Hill Cemetery, the remains being followed to 
their last resting place by a large concourse of sorrowing friends. Mrs. 
Caperton was a true Christian woman, beloved and respected by everyone. She 
leaves surviving her the following children, to whom the deepest sympathy is 
extended: Mrs. Molloy, Miss Mollie Caperton and Messrs. J. P., J. W. and Thomas 
Caperton. -- Columbia Herald, 3 June 1898.</br>
