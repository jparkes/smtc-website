<br/>
ORMAN, W. L.<br/>
<br/>
W. L. Orman died in Spring Hill Saturday, October 23, 1897. He was a citizen of 
Spring Hill for 63 years, and was closely identified with various interest of 
the community. He was a strong advocate of all the great moral questions of the 
day; a full and well-developed Christian gentleman, highly esteemed and 
respected by the citizens. His death cast a gloom of sadness over many hearts. 
He was a ruling elder in the Spring Hill congregation of the C.P. church for 49 
years. He was superintendent of the Sunday-school for about 40 years. He loved 
his work, was faithful in his labors. Was a student of the Bible, earnest in his 
investigation of its precious truths, and clear in his comprehension of its 
divine teachings. He was thoroughly in sympathy with the peculiar doctrines of 
his church. The funeral services were held in C.P. Church Sabbath afternoon at 3 
o'clock, conducted by Rev. T. Jeff Dixon, assisted by Rev. A. W. Denny of the 
C.P. Church, and Rev. T. A. Hardin of the Presbyterian Church. He was laid to 
rest in the Cemetery, who he had been a leader in the burial of many who slept 
in their graves. -- Columbia Herald, 29 Oct. 1897.<br/>
