Elijah Hanes Ayres, Sr. was born 13 June 1853 in VA and died 10 June 1926 in 
Spring Hill. Matthias Leake Ayres and Martha Rebecca Hanes were his parents. He 
was married 23 Nov. 1876 in Buckingham, VA to Lela May Thomason. Their son, 
Elijah Hanes Ayres, Jr. was born 12 Mar 1885 in Dresden, Weakley, TN and died 4 
Oct. 1965 in Kinston, Lenoir, NC. He was married to Harriet "Hattie" McGavock (6 
Apr 1884 - 28 Jul 1955). They married at CARNTON in Franklin, TN 30 Apr 1908 in 
the same house where Hattie was born.<br/>
<br/>
After Sr. passed away, the original Jr. stopped referring to himself as Jr. but 
after his son, Elijah Hanes Ayres, III was born in 1913 began referring to him 
as Elijah Hanes<br/>
Ayres, Jr. (which is the official way he was referred to when he enlisted in the 
military). (Reference WWII Enlistment document).<br/>
