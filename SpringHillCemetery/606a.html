McCARROLL, Col. 
Israel<br/>
<br/>
Col. McCarroll, of Spring Hill, is very ill. -- Columbia Herald, 6 Jan. 1873.<br/>
<br/>
The many friends and acquaintance of Col. Israel McCarroll were deeply grieved 
to learn of his death, which occurred at the residence of Mr. J. H. Reams, on 
last Friday, between the hours of one and two o'clock, A.M. He was a venerable 
and estimable citizen, and of a disposition so amicable that he was loved by all 
who knew him. About two years ago he joined the Methodist Church, from which 
time until his death he lived a devout Christian. His funeral was preached on 
last Sabbath morning at the Methodist church, by Rev. R. G. Irvine, after which 
his remains were conveyed to the Spring Hill cemetery and buried with full 
Masonic honors. -- Columbia Herald, 17 Jan. 1873.<br/>
