HILL CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

Spring Hill Cemetery looking at the Kerr Rodgers &amp; Glenn Memorials and open
areas where unmarked graves abound. We believe some Kerr relative are interred
in the near area of the photo perhaps to the right of the round top Rodgers
&amp; David Kerr memorials.  In fact the spots or areas of darker grasses
in the above photo tend to occupy sunken areas which depict these graves.<br/>
<br/>
There is a David S. Kerr buried
in Spring Hill Cemetery, but it is
David Spear Kerr Jr., 1828 - 1888. The old man David Spear Kerr was born
in 1792 according to my records and died in 1871. That according to my research means
he is
buried in an unmarked grave unless the stone fell and is lost. Mr. Frank Kerr McDaniel's
in "Kerr Family History Project" says David Sr. and David Jr. died in the
same year.  My records do not concur with that as mentioned above David Sr.
died during 1871. This is definitely a simple error that needs to be cleared up.</p>

<p align="center">Mr. Frank Kerr McDaniel
(now deceased) of New Hall California in his book "Kerr
family History Project" visited Spring Hill at one time. I doubt if he
found the graves of David Kerr Sr. and David Jr. among 800 stones. 
Perhaps he found David Jr.'s memorial . It is Kerr family knowledge that David Spear Sr. is interred there.
However interment may be in the Jackson College Cemetery
in an unmarked grave as that is where the remains of his parents were laid to
rest.  David S. Kerr Jr. was Civil War age and like so many
fought
for the South. I have seen him listed in the Civil War Records. At least I saw the name David Kerr somewhere in
the records but it may have been another David Kerr as there were many.<span style="font-family: Arial; color: navy">
