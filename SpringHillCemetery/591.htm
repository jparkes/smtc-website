Miss Maggie Orman died at 1 o'clock this morning at her home in Spring Hill. She 
had been dangerously ill for about four weeks, but the malady from which she was 
suffering was not exactly known until towards the last. It was then pronounced 
cancer of the stomach by her physician, Dr. Dorsett. By her bedside were her 
brothers, J. Sykes and Henry Orman, and her sisters, Misses Janie, Sallie and 
Julia Orman, and Mrs. Coats of Alabama. Their mother died several years ago, and 
Miss Maggie, being the eldest daughter, had since taken, as far as possible, her 
place in the family. Her life has been an unselfish devotion to her brothers and 
sisters and a beautiful example of noble Christian womanhood. The funeral 
services will occur tomorrow at Spring Hill. -- Columbia Herald, 27 Sept. 1892.<br>
