<p align="center">SPRING
HILL CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
From: Marcia Witt</br>
</br>
Barb Miraslaw wrote to me and she has proved C.W. was Charles Wesley Owen.</br>
</br>
1. C.W. Owen was a dry goods merchant/Grocer in Maury County Tenn. Do you see
his death dates?</br>
</br>
2. Do you see tombstone or death for Mary Grigsby Shields, wife of W. R,
Shields, saddlemaker of</br>
Maury Co, Tenn</br>
</br>
Barb Miraslaw also writes this to Marcia Witt: 20 Feb 2010</br>
</br>
I've been busy the last few days studying the Grigsbys and trying to fill in the&nbsp;
gaps.&nbsp; You asked about the marriage of</br>
Frances Grigsby and C. W. Owen and&nbsp; his full name, etc.&nbsp; It took some
time, but it was (in my opinion) a&nbsp; masterful bit</br>
of detectve work.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
I first searched for Fannie Owen in the census records, and knowing that she
died in 1905 (from the Find A Grave entry)</br>
I started with 1900.&nbsp; A Fannie&nbsp; Owen was found, living in Maury County
(b. in Virginia Feb. 1826) with&nbsp; husband Wesley</br>
(b. in Tenn. May 1838), married about 1873.&nbsp; We already know that Frances
and C. W. were married in Nov. of 1872, the</br>
marriage dates are consistent.&nbsp; Then I went to the 1880 census and found
Fannie in Maury County&nbsp; (b. abt. 1838 in</br>
Tenn.) with husband Wesly (b. abt. 1841 in Tenn.), with Wesley's mother Sarah
(b. abt. 1816 in Tenn.).&nbsp; Then I</br>
searched for Sarah&nbsp; Owen in the 1860 census and found Sarah C. Owen in
Maury County (b. abt.1816&nbsp; in Tenn.), with</br>
children Charles W. (b. abt. 1838 in Tenn.), A. F. (a male, b. abt. 1840 in
Tenn.) and Richard W. (b. abt. 1844 in</br>
Tenn.).&nbsp; Then I&nbsp; searched for Sarah in the 1850 census and found her
in Williamson County (b.&nbsp; abt. 1820 in Tenn.) with</br>
children Doney (a female b. abt. 1837 in Tenn.),&nbsp; William (b. abt. 1839),
Wesley (b. abt. 1840), Richard (b. abt.</br>
1843) and&nbsp; someone named Osborne Nicholson (b. abt. 1812 in Tenn.)&nbsp;
Most surprising was&nbsp; that she was living next door</br>
to Cordy and Polly Nicholson, parents of Mary&nbsp; and Matilda (wives of
Benjamin Grigsby.)&nbsp; At this point I'm wondering if</br>
Osborne is a child of Cordy and Polly and is helping out Sarah, since she&nbsp;
lives next door to the Nicholsons.&nbsp; But</br>
then I searched for a potential&nbsp; marriage for Sarah, and found an entry for
Sterling W. Owen, married Jan.&nbsp; 24, 1833</br>
in Williamson County to Sarah C. NICHOLSON.&nbsp; It all made perfect&nbsp;
sense!&nbsp; Charles Wesley Owen, son of Sarah C.</br>
Nicholson Owen (and sister of&nbsp; Mary and Matilda) married Frances Grigsby,
sister of Benjamin Grigsby,&nbsp; husband of</br>
Mary and Matilda.&nbsp; Furthermore, I found a record of death for a&nbsp;
Sterling Williamson Owen, who died at Spring Hill</br>
Feb. 26, 1845.</br>
</br>
I have not found any information to verify that Sarah is indeed the daughter&nbsp;
of Cordy and Polly Nicholson; to the</br>
contrary, I found someone's tree that&nbsp; has her the daughter of a different
Nicholson couple.&nbsp; However, Cordy and&nbsp; Polly</br>
were married Dec. 22, 1813 in Williamson County and a 1816 birth date&nbsp; for
Sarah, and the fact that they were next door</br>
to each other in 1850 would&nbsp; make this a plausible conclusion.&nbsp; Will
have to do more digging to verify.</br>
</br>
Mary Grigsby (daughter of Etchison and Sallie) married W. R. Shields Feb. 7,&nbsp;
1855 in Williamson County.&nbsp; I found the</br>
couple in Maury County in 1860 (Mary&nbsp; was b. abt. 1831 in Virginia, which
is consistent with what we already&nbsp; know.)</br>
Found nothing after that, but I didn't focus too much on it. Will&nbsp; return
to the task later today.</br>
</br>
William G. Grigsby's daughter Sallie married George Stanley Nov. 18, 1872 in&nbsp;
Williamson County and then it appears that</br>
the Grigsbys and daughter Sallie&nbsp; with husband George moved to Navarro
County.&nbsp; After William died, Selena and the kids</br>
came back to Tenn., and Sallie and her husband stayed in Navarro&nbsp; County.&nbsp;
(I have no idea of why Selena went to</br>
Pulaski - I surmise that she&nbsp; had relatives in Giles County, but have no
proof yet.)&nbsp; Sallie and George&nbsp; had 3 children;</br>
some time between 1880 and 1890 Sallie must have died because George has a
different wife in 1900, and an</br>
approximate marriage&nbsp; date of 1890, with 3 more children born between 1891
and 1899.</br>
</br>
As for Matilda's age - I'm thinking that whomever took the information from&nbsp;
the tombstone may have read it wrong,</br>
because the census records indicate&nbsp; that she was born about 20 years later
than what you have.&nbsp; I'm not saying&nbsp; that</br>
they did, but I know from personal experience that old tombstones can&nbsp; be
hard to decipher.&nbsp; I'm withholding</br>
judgment on this issue until I see&nbsp; actual photos of the tombstone, or can
go to the cemetery and see for&nbsp; myself.</br>
And I am going to go there, along with other cemeteries. Just too&nbsp; many
unanswered questions right now!</br>
</br>
Marcia, (Marcia Witt) I hope you are pleased with the new information.&nbsp; I'm
kind of proud of the result.</br>
