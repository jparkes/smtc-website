<p align="center">SPRING
HILL CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
From: Marcia Witt<br/>
<br/>
Barb Miraslaw wrote to me and she has proved C.W. was Charles Wesley Owen.<br/>
<br/>
1. C.W. Owen was a dry goods merchant/Grocer in Maury County Tenn. Do you see
his death dates?<br/>
<br/>
2. Do you see tombstone or death for Mary Grigsby Shields, wife of W. R,
Shields, saddlemaker of<br/>
Maury Co, Tenn<br/>
<br/>
Barb Miraslaw also writes this to Marcia Witt: 20 Feb 2010<br/>
<br/>
I've been busy the last few days studying the Grigsbys and trying to fill in the 
gaps.  You asked about the marriage of<br/>
Frances Grigsby and C. W. Owen and  his full name, etc.  It took some
time, but it was (in my opinion) a  masterful bit<br/>
of detectve work. <br/>
<br/>
I first searched for Fannie Owen in the census records, and knowing that she
died in 1905 (from the Find A Grave entry)<br/>
I started with 1900.  A Fannie  Owen was found, living in Maury County
(b. in Virginia Feb. 1826) with  husband Wesley<br/>
(b. in Tenn. May 1838), married about 1873.  We already know that Frances
and C. W. were married in Nov. of 1872, the<br/>
marriage dates are consistent.  Then I went to the 1880 census and found
Fannie in Maury County  (b. abt. 1838 in<br/>
Tenn.) with husband Wesly (b. abt. 1841 in Tenn.), with Wesley's mother Sarah
(b. abt. 1816 in Tenn.).  Then I<br/>
searched for Sarah  Owen in the 1860 census and found Sarah C. Owen in
Maury County (b. abt.1816  in Tenn.), with<br/>
children Charles W. (b. abt. 1838 in Tenn.), A. F. (a male, b. abt. 1840 in
Tenn.) and Richard W. (b. abt. 1844 in<br/>
Tenn.).  Then I  searched for Sarah in the 1850 census and found her
in Williamson County (b.  abt. 1820 in Tenn.) with<br/>
children Doney (a female b. abt. 1837 in Tenn.),  William (b. abt. 1839),
Wesley (b. abt. 1840), Richard (b. abt.<br/>
1843) and  someone named Osborne Nicholson (b. abt. 1812 in Tenn.) 
Most surprising was  that she was living next door<br/>
to Cordy and Polly Nicholson, parents of Mary  and Matilda (wives of
Benjamin Grigsby.)  At this point I'm wondering if<br/>
Osborne is a child of Cordy and Polly and is helping out Sarah, since she 
lives next door to the Nicholsons.  But<br/>
then I searched for a potential  marriage for Sarah, and found an entry for
Sterling W. Owen, married Jan.  24, 1833<br/>
in Williamson County to Sarah C. NICHOLSON.  It all made perfect 
sense!  Charles Wesley Owen, son of Sarah C.<br/>
Nicholson Owen (and sister of  Mary and Matilda) married Frances Grigsby,
sister of Benjamin Grigsby,  husband of<br/>
Mary and Matilda.  Furthermore, I found a record of death for a 
Sterling Williamson Owen, who died at Spring Hill<br/>
Feb. 26, 1845.<br/>
<br/>
I have not found any information to verify that Sarah is indeed the daughter 
of Cordy and Polly Nicholson; to the<br/>
contrary, I found someone's tree that  has her the daughter of a different
Nicholson couple.  However, Cordy and  Polly<br/>
were married Dec. 22, 1813 in Williamson County and a 1816 birth date  for
Sarah, and the fact that they were next door<br/>
to each other in 1850 would  make this a plausible conclusion.  Will
have to do more digging to verify.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Grigsby (daughter of Etchison and Sallie) married W. R. Shields Feb. 7, 
1855 in Williamson County.  I found the<br/>
couple in Maury County in 1860 (Mary  was b. abt. 1831 in Virginia, which
is consistent with what we already  know.)<br/>
Found nothing after that, but I didn't focus too much on it. Will  return
to the task later today.<br/>
<br/>
William G. Grigsby's daughter Sallie married George Stanley Nov. 18, 1872 in 
Williamson County and then it appears that<br/>
the Grigsbys and daughter Sallie  with husband George moved to Navarro
County.  After William died, Selena and the kids<br/>
came back to Tenn., and Sallie and her husband stayed in Navarro  County. 
(I have no idea of why Selena went to<br/>
Pulaski - I surmise that she  had relatives in Giles County, but have no
proof yet.)  Sallie and George  had 3 children;<br/>
some time between 1880 and 1890 Sallie must have died because George has a
different wife in 1900, and an<br/>
approximate marriage  date of 1890, with 3 more children born between 1891
and 1899.<br/>
<br/>
As for Matilda's age - I'm thinking that whomever took the information from 
the tombstone may have read it wrong,<br/>
because the census records indicate  that she was born about 20 years later
than what you have.  I'm not saying  that<br/>
they did, but I know from personal experience that old tombstones can  be
hard to decipher.  I'm withholding<br/>
judgment on this issue until I see  actual photos of the tombstone, or can
go to the cemetery and see for  myself.<br/>
And I am going to go there, along with other cemeteries. Just too  many
unanswered questions right now!<br/>
<br/>
Marcia, (Marcia Witt) I hope you are pleased with the new information.  I'm
kind of proud of the result.<br/>
