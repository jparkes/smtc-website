No stone exist in this the Spring Hill cemetery. If it did it would be considered a Cenotaph. 
The family has recently decided to dedicate a military Cenotaph to his memory 
which is soon to be unveiled.<br>
<br>
His father also Elijah Haynes Ayres opened the first bank in Spring Hill around 
1901. The Ayres family lived just down the street from the bank. EH III was a teller 
in his dad's bank at the time of WW II. <br>
<br>
Although he was really EH the third, after his grandfather EH b. 1853 passed away, he actually 
began going by Jr. As opposed to III. <br>

Ayres </b>and <b>Martha Rebecca Hanes</b>. Sr.. EH Ayres was married 23 Nov. 1876 in

died 4 Oct. 1965 in Kinston, Lenoir, NC. He was married to <b>Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; McGavock </b>(6 Apr 1884 - 28 Jul 1955). They married at 
CARNTON in Franklin, TN 30 Apr 1908 in the same house where Hattie was born.

b. 1913 
as <b>Elijah Hanes Ayres, Jr. </b>
(which is the official way he was 
referred to when he enlisted in the military). (Reference WWII Enlistment 
document).</font></p>
<font >
<p ALIGN="center"><font size="2">Elijah Hanes Ayers b. 1913 was nicknamed &quot;Buddy&quot;. 
His nephews called him 
&quot;Uncle Bud&quot;. He graduated from Branham and Hughes Military Academy's last class 
before the school closed in 1932. He went to California for a short time and attended a Community College. 
When he returned he enrolled in Vanderbilt University and graduated in 1936. He 
had applied for a commission to Officer's Commission School which was in the works when he was drafted 8 
April 1942 and sent to Ft. Oglethorpe, GA. He was in training to be a navigator 
on a bomber and was on his way to England on the USS Dorchester when it was torpedoed near 
Greenland 3 Feb 1943. A few years after his death one of his shipmates came to 
see Hanes' dad to tell him how his son had perished. He was not injured in the 
torpedo&nbsp;incident but ended up in the water where he was picked up in a 
lifeboat from another ship that was in their convoy. He was cold and wet when picked up and died in the lifeboat 
shortly after being picked up. At Ft. Oglethorpe he was an assistant leader and 
would have been a radio man on a B-17 Flying Fortress or a Gunner on a 
Liberator.<br>

<p ALIGN="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="2" FACE="Helvetica">NEW BUILDING TO REPLACE OLD BANK<br>
&quot;They called it the Hole-in-the-Wall Bank,&quot; laughs Mrs Wharton Cheairs, 
recalling the beginnings of the old Spring Hill Bank.<br>
The original bank building in Spring is scheduled to be torn down soon and since 
word got out a stream of people have been by to photograph the building.<br>
<br>
The Spring Hill Bank was founded in 1901 by E. H. Ayres Sr. b. 1885. Mrs. Cheairs' father. 
Until a building could be erected business was conducted in a small building 
in the same block, a spot so small<br>
that local wags called it the hole-in-the-wall.<br>
But in 1903 a new two-story brick structure, costing $5,000, was erected on the 
old hitchyard lot at the corner of Depot and Main Streets. For many years a bank 
was located in this same building,<br>
but in the past few years other business ventures have occupied the spot.<br>
Mr. Ayres had come to Spring Hill at the suggestion of W. C. Branham head of the 
Branham and Hughes School and opened the bank with a capital stock of $15,000. 
The first of officers were:<br>
Walter Bailey, president: John S. Odil, vice-president; E. H. Ayres, cashier; 
and Lawrence T. Ayres, assistant cashier. Other early members of the board 
included W. E. Martin, Allen Campbell, J. R.<br>
Buckner, J. S. Brown, J. A. McMeen, F. P. Brumbach, E. P. Chapman, A. W. 
Beckwith, Jr., R. L. Hays, and William Hughes. Later
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" FACE="Helvetica">E. H. Ayres. Jr. (our 
subject)
</font><font color="#000080" size="2" FACE="Helvetica">became assistant cashier 
here.<br>
Mrs. Cheairs remembers the bank dinner held the first Saturday in January each 
year. &quot;The wives of the directors did the cooking. My mother usually cooked a 
turkey and a ham. Mrs. Henry Pointer<br>
always made a Lady Baltimore cake and a Prince of Wales cake for the occasion,&quot; 
she says.<br>
The dinner was held in the bank directors room and just about everyone in Spring 
Hill came. Dinners were sent to those who were ill and unable to come, and 
plates were always taken to the<br>
telephone operators in the branch telephone office located in the second story 
of the bank. A huge coffee pot was kept on the stove in Odil's Store next door 
throughout the day of the dinner. These<br>
annual dinners were discontinued about the time of the first World War (II). <br>
The burglar alarm was installed by Mr. Ayres and he turned it on one day so 
everyone in town would know what it sounded like. <br>
&quot;One night we were in church.&quot; recalls Mrs. Cheairs, &quot;when a man came in 
hurriedly and whispered something to my brother, Hanes, who left immediately. 
Then another came for my<br>
Daddy, who also left the church. Filled with curiosity, other men left the 
service to see what was going on. Finally the minister dismissed us early so 
everyone could see what the excitement was<br>
about. The bank burglar alarm had sounded. Men surrounded the bank, armed with 
rocks, sticks, guns, axes, and anything handy to catch the bank robbers.<br>

Years later - after the War, a young man went to the bank looking<br>
for Daddy and told him he knew exactly how Hanes had died. Since they <br>
had been together during all the Army days and together when Hanes<br>
died, he wanted to tell Mother and Daddy if they'd like to know. So, <br>
Daddy took him home to Mother and he told them his almost unbelievable tale.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000080">
He had been with Hanes when the ship was struck. They jumped <br>
together and made it to a life boat. After an hour of more during which <br>
time Hanes led the singing, and helped try to keep everybody's spirits'<br>
up, he suddenly asked his friend if he really thought they'd be picked<br>
up. The other boy said he was hopeful, and with that, Hanes emitted a <br>
loud &quot;Oh&quot; and slumped over, dead from a heart attack. His buddies buried <br>
him at sea. (A beautiful monument to those nearly 6,000 men who lost<br>
their lives in the North Atlantic has been erected in Battery Park, here<br>
in New York City - looking out toward the Statue of Liberty). Hanes'&nbsp; name <br>
is easily found. It's the last &quot;A&quot; on the first column on the right <br>
side.&nbsp; Rod and I were invited to the dedication. President Kennedy <br>
dedicated it himself which was on May 23, 1963 and he was assassinated <br>
on November 22, 1963. <br>
