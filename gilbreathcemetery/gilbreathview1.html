&amp; Sherry Elliot place. Their son as a Boy Scout Project promotional project has made many
improvements. This included cleanup; building a fence around the cemetery; and they staked out various points with little yellow flags
to mark the unmarked graves, the graves with field stones, and the small
footstones that were in danger of being covered with debris. They are to be
commended for a great job. <i>Dec 2002 Photo by WA.</i></font></b>

stones but looking east from the opposite side of the Coffee Area of the
Cemetery. From right to left is Calvin Coffee, son of Nathan &amp; Elizabeth
Gilbreath Coffee; Elizabeth (Fine) Coffee daughter of William &amp; Catherine
Sively Fine; Martin V West, son of Samuel &amp; Minerva Samuels West &amp; first
spouse of Martha S Coffee Morrow; Martha S (Coffee) Morrow, dau of Calvin &amp;
Elizabeth Fine Coffee; Isaiah H. Gilbreath (back one row), son of James &amp;
Elizabeth Baker Gilbreath; Major Isaac Hamilton Coffee, son of Calvin &amp;
Elizabeth (Fine) Coffee and father of an only child William Fine Coffee who
lived a long life as a prominent citizen &amp; store owner in Maury County;
Virginia Isabella Coffee, 7 year old daughter of Calvin &amp; Elizabeth; Calvin
J. Coffee, 10 year old son of Calvin and Elizabeth Fine Coffee. Now you know why
they call these family cemeteries. The arrows point to flags that mark fieldstones or unmarked graves.
I know at least one of those had a sunken in place
that was an adult size. Big question is who were these people in the unmarked
graves? That is for
all the genealogist to ponder? If you follow the family lines they were probably
Coffee's or Morrows. <i>Dec
