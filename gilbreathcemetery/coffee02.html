<center><b>COFFEE,
Elizabeth, 13 Jun 1809 - 8 Nov 1882. �Wife of Calvin Coffee.� (Stone
broken.) Inscription: &quot;ELIZABETH wife of CALVIN COFFEE June 13, 1809 - Nov.
8 1882. My kind dear wife has gone to mansions above yonder sky. To gaze on the
throne of him who is sealed on high&quot;. It is believed she was the daughter of
William &amp; Elizabeth (Sively) Fine. This stone is actually broken and the top
rests against the base. I set the top on the base and supported it with a pole
to make the photograph. Then I eliminated the fracture line with computer
software. The stone
needs to be repaired with 2 stainless steel pins, epoxy glued and leveled at the
base to have long term viability. &nbsp; </b></center>
