<center><b>COFFEE,
Elizabeth, 13 Jun 1809 - 8 Nov 1882. �Wife of Calvin Coffee.� (Stone
broken.) Inscription: "ELIZABETH wife of CALVIN COFFEE June 13, 1809 - Nov.
8 1882. My kind dear wife has gone to mansions above yonder sky. To gaze on the
throne of him who is sealed on high". It is believed she was the daughter of
William &amp; Elizabeth (Sively) Fine. This stone is actually broken and the top
rests against the base. I set the top on the base and supported it with a pole
to make the photograph. Then I eliminated the fracture line with computer
software. The stone
needs to be repaired with 2 stainless steel pins, epoxy glued and leveled at the
base to have long term viability.   </b></center>
