northwest
standing behind and north of the giant Oak tree which is partly shading this
photo at the Gilbreath area. Notice
the fieldstone marking a grave (hard to see because of the darkness)
between the Susan M Ussery grave and the John Baker Gilbreath grave. More than
likely someone closely related to Susan or John. <i>Dec 2002 Photo by WA.</i></b>

view but showing &amp; labeling all the marked stones of the Gilbreath area. One can see the edge
of the large Oak Tree on your left. Use your scroll bars to scroll around and see all the
stones in this photo. It is a wide panoramic view. Area out back of these stones and
to your right have many open areas for fieldstones and other grave markers with
no inscriptions. Minerva E. Gilbreath has two
stones one is hidden from your view behind the John Baker Gilbreath stone. The
foot stones are located on the opposite side of the grave from Head Stone
Markers  <i>Dec
