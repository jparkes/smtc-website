<center><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">WEST, Martin V.,
15 Apr 1841 - 14 Jun 1872. 31-02-00. (Son of Samuel &amp; Manerva (Samuel) West &amp; a Sister of Emma
Frances (West) Coffee all of northern Giles County). Was married to Martha S.
Coffee at the time of his death. Martha remarried to a A.A. Morrow and is now
interred in the next grave. I guess this hints that there were children from
this marriage and the children buried their Mom back with their father? Well,
not conclusive. Need more research. &nbsp; </font></b></center>
