<center><b>COFFEE, Isaac H.,(Isaac
Hamilton), 19 Jun 1828 - 28 Feb 1868. Mason. (married to Emily (Emma) Frances West of 
Blue Branch - northern
Giles County) One child-William Fine Coffee, born about the time of Isaac's death.
(Soldier of the Civil War possibly a Major in the Confederacy. His son William F
Coffee mentioned him in the 1950s as Major Hamilton Coffee. The records
I've seen shows the rank of Sergeant). Family legend says he was killed in a prize
fight shortly after the Civil War Another story was that he fell off a horse and 
died. My opinion is he died as one of the many confederate solders murdered in 
the aftermath of the civil war. Inscription reads: &quot;This is a memorial
of Isaac H. Coffee. <u>h</u>e <u>W</u>as born June 19th 1828 &amp; departed this life February
28th 1868&quot;.&nbsp;<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~maury/Giles-Marshall-LincolnCountyCemWeb/WestCemeteryGilesCo/BlueBranchHistory-IHCoffeesLongRifle.html">History
