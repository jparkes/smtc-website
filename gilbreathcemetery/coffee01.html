<center><b>COFFEE, Calvin, 5
July 1805 - 16 Jan 1889. Inscription: "IN MEMORY OF CALVIN COFFEE JULY 5,
1805 - JAN. 16, 1889 Erected by his grandson, W. W. Wilcoxson". Son of Nathan and Elizabeth Gilbreath Coffee. Nathan and Elizabeth are interred
in the Reeses Chapel Cemetery. It is believed the Calvin Coffee's lived across
Preacher Holt Road in what is now (2002) the Buckner Home when it was once a log
cabin. <br/>
 Except for a part of the base this stone was
completely buried under the soil &amp; debris. The base still needs to be set in concrete to insure its standing. Sorry I could
not clean the soil stains. Wayne Austin.</b></center>
