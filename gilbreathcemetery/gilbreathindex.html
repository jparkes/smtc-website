***Thanks for posting Maury County Cemeteries. I viewed the Gilbreath-Morrow
Cemetery where Mary Richards Gilbreath is suppose to be buried. Mary Richards is
the daughter of Aaron and Cloe Richards and was called Polly. Polly and Andrew
Gilbreath were married in Adair County Kentucky Dec. 26, 1811. Andrew was the son
of John and Mary Coffee Gilbreath. Andrew was born in South Carolina and moved
with his parents to Kentucky. Mary died in 1827 as well as I can ascertain,
after giving birth to her last child Andrew Farggie Gilbreath. Her husband 
remarried and moved to Texas.&nbsp; Looks like she may have not
rated a head stone and is in one of the unmarked graves. Should you ever find
anything about her I would appreciate it if you would contact me. </br>
</br>
***Andrew and Mary Gilbreath moved to Tennessee in 1820, along with his parents John and Mary Coffey Gilbreath. 
After Mary Pollys' death Andrew married Rachel McIntosh (1827) and moved to Texas around 1846. The 1850 Census does not show the Gilbreath�s in Adair Co. KY. Mary (Polly) is buried in the Marrow Family Cemetery
near Mt. Pleasant Tennessee near Columbia. Andrew and Rachel are interred in the 
Woodstock CemeteryAndrew�s sister Jane Gilbreath
married John Leonard Morrow, thus the Morrow Cemetery. Dennis Richards
