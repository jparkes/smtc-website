southeast over an open area of the cemetery, the arrows mark field stones,
unmarked graves or foot markers which may be fieldstones (small stones with
initials). My guess is because of this being in the first part of the
cemetery from where the road into the cemetery was located could mean these
graves might have been for the earliest burials in the cemetery. The First grave
with a marked stone that we know of is Martin V West in 1841 shown above. Martin
had a sister named Emily West Coffee who died in 1872. Her husband is two graves
down from Martin West. Her grave site is unknown not in Maury or Giles County
thus she might be interred here in an unmarked site. We believe this cemetery
was certainly being used prior to 1841.  <i>Dec 2002 Photo by WA.</i></b>

view is moved over toward the north down the row still in the Coffee area. One can see the edge
of the large Oak tree. The Ussery family was buried on both sides of it. My
estimate is the old tree is more than 150 years old. Following that assumption
it existed prior to the burials though a much smaller tree. Susan's husband and
John G.'s father Joseph C. I believe is not buried here because he went on with
his life after Susan &amp; John's death and is buried in Lawrence County.  <i>Dec
