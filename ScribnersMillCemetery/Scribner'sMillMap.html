<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Scribner's
Mill Cemetery is located on the premises of the Bethany Church of Christ but
across the McKnight road. The
stream shown above is Fountain Creek. The old Scribner's Mill was near the
intersection of the road and the Creek. These old mills often served as the hub
of the community in the olden days when they were used to turn wheat and corn
grain into flour &amp; meal.</br>
