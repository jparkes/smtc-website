 Lewis A Scribner is the son of Lewis and Amanda. His wife was Lula A.
Roland. Louella is listed on her stone as "sister". My records show
her is the daughter of Lewis A. and Lula. The stones must have been placed by
children of Lewis A and Lula. Also I believe there is a main monument for these
stones which was not photographed.<i><br/>
