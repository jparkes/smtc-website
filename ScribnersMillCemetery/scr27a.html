Lewis A., 9 Jul 1884 - 11 Dec 1956, &quot;Father&quot;.</br>
and</br>
&nbsp;SCRIBNER, Lula A., 6 Apr 1886 12 Oct 1966, &quot;Mother&quot;. </br>
also</br>
SCRIBNER, Louella D., 18 Oct 1909 - 15 Oct 1951, &quot;Sister&quot;.</br>
&nbsp;Lewis A Scribner is the son of Lewis and Amanda. His wife was Lula A.
Roland. Louella is listed on her stone as &quot;sister&quot;. My records show
her is the daughter of Lewis A. and Lula. The stones must have been placed by
children of Lewis A and Lula. Also I believe there is a main monument for these
stones which was not photographed.<i></br>
