</br>
</a>Go 1/4 mile south of Murphy Lane on Pulaski Pike, to the place owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Victor Rasberry on the left who have lived
there since Mr. Fred Hawkins visited in 1988. The small cemetery is near
Lytle Creek in a small grove of trees. A rock wall encloses a space large enough
for four to six graves. No stones are now in place and the Rasberrys know
nothing about persons who might have been buried there in the past.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
If you have knowledge about this please send us an e-mail and lets get that on
this site.</br>
