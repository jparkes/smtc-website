Excavation to uncover lost stones took place that day with much success. At
least one new stone was found and is revealed here. We were saddened to find so
many missing pieces of memorials as can be seen in the photos. I believe with
more probing (no deeper than 4 inches) &amp; excavation more historical details
will come to light regarding the memorials. [WA 7 May 2008]</i></b>
