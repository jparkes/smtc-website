</i>GOODING, Sarah Ann, .... of ........ Goodin, .. ... 18.3, 4 ... 1850.
&quot;A dutiful Child, A kind mother, an Affectionate wife. She died in the
blessed triumph of an immortal life. (Broken.) We vound these stones buried and
uncovered them and assembled them for reading. A feat Mr Fred Hawkins also
mentioned he did so in 1987. It is phenomenal that in 20 years the stones can
sink below the ground again.&nbsp;<i></br>
