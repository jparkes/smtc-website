CEMETERY-LYTLE CREEK &amp; HICKMAN LANE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>


<b></b></b></p><center><b><b>GALLAHER, Jas., "Son of S.
P. Mc...., Feb , d. 30 Jul 1828, months." (This stone was broken into many
pieces and scattered about. I was able to assemble it and read the information
given above. <i>Fred Lee Hawkins,1987)</i> <br/>
I was unable to confirm this stone. For one thing it seems from the information
Mr. Fred gave our subject was a son of SP McKee and how could then the surname
be Gallaher unless he was adopted or something. Well I don't know everything, so
we are publishing as is. <i><br/>
