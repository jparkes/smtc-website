Photo by Mary Belle Duvivier of New York 14 Apr 2008. Folks this is a new
listing never before revealed to historical circles. Thanks to all the hard work
from the team of Marc &amp; Mary Belle Duvivier and myself. We dug up many stones here but
were saddened that so many of them were shattered and pieces lost by the works
of the Vandals. Accompanying Mary
Belle &amp; Marc Duvivier that day was Wayne Austin who also made photos.</i></center></b><center><b><a href="GoodingCemetery.htm"></br>
