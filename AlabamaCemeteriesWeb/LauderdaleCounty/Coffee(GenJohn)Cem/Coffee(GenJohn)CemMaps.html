This topographical map shows the GPS of
the General John Coffee Cemetery. The old home is shown in southeast of the 
cemetery.<br/>

 At the 
intersection of Hwy 157 aka Cloverdale Road turn north and go abut 100 yards to 
the first driveway on the left. You will notice a John Coffee Historical Marker 
at that location. 
This is a private drive so follow it up noticing the signs that direct you as to 
what is private property and what is labeled as the cemetery visitor area. Park in the designated parking spot for the cemetery 
visitors. You will walk strait ahead west for some distance up the cemetery road 
then bend back nortward. The walk to the cemetery is inside the 
chained off road/pathway and from your car nearly 1/4 of a mile. the pathway first goes westward then bends 
back northward (right) and as of now is a mowed pathway probably provided by the property 
owner.

Notice the cemetery location surrounded by trees. While I was there I noticed that vandals had 
visited the cemetery in the recent past and moved the tops of the box tombs 
around so they could peek inside. I can assure you folks you will not see 
bodies inside these tombs. Nor will you see anything except wasp nest and other 
varmints that bite, sting and cause you to itch. These tombs serve only as grave covers. The burial occurred 
sooner than the box tomb was set in some cases by years and was the usual 6 feet under ground. If you 
are caught defacing this property you will feel the full extent of the law. So wise up and leave these tombs alone. I 
slide them back in 
place centering them on the bases in spite of some weighing something over 500 pounds.<br/>
