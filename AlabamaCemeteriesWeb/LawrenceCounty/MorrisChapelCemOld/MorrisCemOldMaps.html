This topographical map from Topozone shows the GPS of (actually the old) Morris Chapel Cemetery. This cemetery was active until the 
church was moved to the new location in the early 20th century.<br/>
ACME Mapper: N 34.54118 / W 87.16958<br/>

 This road map from MS Streets &amp; trips shows the directions as: Go east on 
Highway 24 toward Decatur and turn (left) north on County Rd 221 and follow that 
road about a mile and turn left into the shortcut road (county Rd 451) which 
goes between CR 221 and CR 316. Go about half the way the distance of that road 
(a few hundred yards) and with permission go walking down the slope west and across 
the (swampy) branch and turn south and follow along the west side walking now south 
past the first grove of trees to the second one south of the first one. The 
cemetery is in the second grove of trees as can be seen in the aerial map below.<br/>

The cemetery is scattered over the area of the grove of trees marked by the red 
check. The marked graves are in the western part (your left) under the trees in a 
long north/south irregular row or rows.<br/>
