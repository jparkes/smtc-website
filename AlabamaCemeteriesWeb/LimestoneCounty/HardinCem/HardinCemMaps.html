From Athens go out Hwy 251 north to Thatch Road (Hwy 100,crosses I-65 at exit 
361) and turn right.  Just before the road turns back south look right  
up the slope in the cattle field at the distant clump of trees. Also there is a pond 
northwest of the cemetery and a small barn like building just behind the 
cemetery. It is not fenced and cattle are free to trample the cemetery as they 
wish. So what do you want, cattle trampling the growth down or installing a 
fence and run away vegetation destroying the cemetery. Both the result of an 
abandoned cemetery. Cemeteries require maintenance.<br/>

This aerial view above
shows the cemetery pointed out with a red check under the grove of trees, south 
of Thatch Road. The ridges seen here are soil conservation works, formed to trap water run 
off. These are to prevent soil erosion. <br/>
