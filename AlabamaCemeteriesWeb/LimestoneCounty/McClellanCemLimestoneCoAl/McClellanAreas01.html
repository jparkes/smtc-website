This view standing next to the north fence looks southwest across the cemetery
at the large monument for Thomas &amp; Martha McClellan. Nearer to us is the
memorial for their son William C. McClellan. Leaning against the large Cedar
Tree is the unknown memorial which shows only a death date of 1859. Likely it is
for one of the family members of the McClellan family.<br/>

This view from inside the cemetery looking north shows much open space with some
signs of field stones marking graves and a grave or two that has no stone
marking it.<br/>

This view looking northwest at the backside of the cemetery. It shows the
cemetery drops of quickly at the back. The Limestone Creek bluff is on our left
beyond the fence about 50 yards.<br/>
