BLACK, Alexander, born 1838 &amp; died 1910. (son of John Black &amp; Winnie
Hite Peace Black married 23 Jan 1861, Alexander 2nd married to Mary E. Willett
16 Aug 1894)<br/>
Of course I cannot without a doubt say this is the grave stone of
Alexander Black but there are evidences that it is and so leave it as a theory.
Having studied archeology as a young man I am comfortable with that terminology.
This is a very prominent adult
grave which may be the grave of Alexander Black due to being the next grave from
what I believe to be south of Sarah his wife. It has one of the fieldstones as
they are called. It had fallen flat on the ground. I reset it back into its
original place. I did probe the space several inches deep to see if a formal
memorial stone had fallen and sunken into the soft grave, but found nothing. So
if Alexander had a memorial stone set here then it was probably stolen or destroyed.
An active fieldstone is one indication that there was never a memorial put down,
but not absolute proof. Often they would leave the fieldstone in place even
after setting the formal grave marker, but most often they removed the
fieldstone after setting the formal memorial.<i><b><br/>
