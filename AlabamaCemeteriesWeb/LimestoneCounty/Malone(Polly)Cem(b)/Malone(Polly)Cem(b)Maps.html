From Athens travel Hwy 31 south to Tanner &amp; turn east (left) on Huntsville-Brownsferry 
Road. Go a few miles to the Malone Cemetery Road and turn north (left) and follow that to 
the cemetery about 1/2 mile from the road.</b></font><b><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="MaloneCemAerial(b).jpg" width="1020" height="467"><br>
This aerial view above
shows the cemetery located under a stand of trees on a small hill. The white 
area is the southwest corner of the cemetery area and the black citizens are 
using the pretty much the rest of the cemetery which is still active today.<br>

This map shows the layout of the sections of this cemetery. The break in 
sections will be obvious when you see the cemetery. The upright &amp; box tombs from 
the old white section are very very old while the black citizens use this 
cemetery even today - using modern granite monuments. In no way am I specifying 
the legal boundaries of anything in this cemetery. These are estimates of 
general areas drawn up by this researcher for use by all the descendents of this 
cemetery to find their kin. <br>
