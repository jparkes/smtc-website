This map shows the the Donaldson Cemetery on the bank of Highway 72 West north
side next to a farmers land bank. It has been cleared recently but still remains in
danger of caving off into the ditch of the roadbed. If something is not done soon the
neighbors will begin to see old caskets or bones protruding from the bank.</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><br/>

tree between a retail (Rug) business and a bank (Farmers Land) next to the road.
One can see the one oval top upright stone from the highway and the box tomb
slabs almost on the ground. </span></b><br/>

Google Map shows a winter view of the Hackberry Tree that marks the place where
the cemetery is located. Below the tree on the
bank of the road is this small family cemetery. It is shown indicated with a yellow
pointer. Notice the bare red clay eroding away. That will eventually pose a
threat to the existence of this cemetery unless steps are taken to get
vegetation to grow there.<br/>
LOCATION: NE quarter of SW quarter, Sect. 25, T3S, R3W on the north side of Hwy.
72 West.</span><br/>
