the cedar stump with the initials W.M.D. ) "<i>a mark of esteem for (the)

There are three large slabs, 1 upright tombstone also marks the head of the
middle slab and 2 field- stones. The Lucy Byrde memorial is already being
undermined by soil erosion and will eventually slide into the ditch below
without maintenance.   Also grass does not grow on the bank south 
(next to) of Lucey's tomb and there is a danger that without grass the soil will 
wash away and expose grave remains.</p>
