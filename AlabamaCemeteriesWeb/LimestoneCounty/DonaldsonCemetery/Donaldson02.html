The grave covering slab for William M. Donaldson just left of the old cedar
stump and the upright memorial as a headstone bearing the inscription. Notice the stars inscribed on
the four corners. There is one on the top of the headstone and one on the
footstone that is broken. The slab has the inscription that follows below. <i>Photo

2013 one can see the deterioration in 
the stone since 2007 in the readability of this inscription.<br/>
Slab covering the grave of William M. Donaldson. Inscribed as: "<i>a mark
of esteem for departed worth this marble, is erected by his wife Nancy Donaldson."</i>
The appearance in the image above of broken stone is not real. The image for the right side of
the memorial was enhanced to be able to read the inscription because of a shadow
on that side. This leaves the unrealistic appearance of a broken chip sitting
beside the left part.</b><a href="DonaldsonCemMaps.html"><br/>
