From Athens go out N. Jefferson St and veer right onto Hays Mill Road. Follow 
that across Thatch Road where it becomes Pettusville Road and follow that and you find the left turn onto Spence Cave Road. 
Spence Cave Rd winds and twist around, but just before 
the State Line look to the left under a grove of trees for the sign to the Payne 
Cemetery which is African-American. Along that road to the left is the 
Harlow Cemetery which is  a white cemetery and much smaller and older, but 
veer right and you will find the entrance into the Payne Cemetery.<br/>

This aerial view above
shows the cemetery south and much bigger than the Harlow Cemetery. Both are 
pointed out with a red check along with a rough white outline of the cemetery 
premises. <br/>
