<b><font color="#000080" size="2">Scroll around to read the various location 
names and numbers. Lots are numbers left to right from 1 to about 2000. If you 
are unable to make out the specific location number then get a nearby location 
number that you can read and count over to the specific location you wish to 
investigate. Sorry I did not take the time to make it perfectly readable. The  
Limestone County Archives has this map and can help you if you call them. This 
map shows the lot purchaser, Lot Number, and the cemetery Area. This may not be 
the name on the gravestone and each lot may be larger than one grave.</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"><b> 
If this map does not display large enough for you to read then copy it to your 
graphic image program and you should be able to read it or enlarge it more.</b></font></font></p>
