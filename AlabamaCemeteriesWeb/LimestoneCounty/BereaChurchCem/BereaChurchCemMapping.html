From Athens go northwest on Hwy 99 aka Buck Island Road several miles to Elk 
River Mills Road and turn left. Follow that for 1/4 mile and turn into the 
cemetery road. There is a cemetery sign at that road. It is a field road but 
plays out before it gets to the cemetery. Go toward the grove of trees that 
contain the cemetery about 400 yards from the road. <br/>

This aerial view shows the cemetery inside a clump of trees. I have made an 
attempt to divide it up by heritage but I do not know the heritage of the area 
surveyed on the left or 3rd but think it is Caucasian even if it is outside the 
fence. The above map is solely an attempt to display the prominent 
clusters of graves and not any other type of division of the graveyard 
perimeters.<br/>
