Eppy Tillery's 80 acre land purchase 1 mar 1858. See land document below. I had 
assumed the below purchase was for a tract whereby the Tillery Cemetery was 
included, but (opps) maybe the Tillery family plot of 80 acres if that was all 
there were was due south in the 80 acre area fronting on Pulaski Pike.<br/>

<b>Document says this land is in the SE quarter of Section 12, but the cemetery 
is in the NE quarter. Wonder if that is an error or maybe this cemetery was 
actually started on another parties land north of Eppy Tillery's or the 
graveyard land was included in a purchase from an earlier or later time. The 
earliest recorded stone is for 5 year old Sarak K. Freeman, 1849. or 9 years 
before the above land purchase, but the unmarked areas of the cemetery leaves us 
in question.</b></p>

You begin your off-road journey traveling south west of Elkwood Section Rd while still 
inside Madison County Section 7 and then cross into Section 12 of Limestone County 
where you will find the cemetery in the center of the Northeast Quad of section 
12. Eppy Tillery purchased above one eighth of the Section 12, but not this one 
in this particular purchase assuming no errors.<br/>
