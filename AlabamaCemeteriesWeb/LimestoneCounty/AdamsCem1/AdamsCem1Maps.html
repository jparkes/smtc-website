From Athens take Hines Street North which becomes Edgewood Road which becomes 
Easter Ferry Road. Branch right off of Easter Ferry Rd onto Legg Town Road and 
after about a mile turn left on Shoals Creek Road. You can see the cemetery in a 
large field on the right about 200 yards from the road.<br/>

This photo view from Google as I have it labeled shows the cemetery in front of 
the small grove of trees. In this 2008 photo view one can see at least one cedar 
tree. Looks to be wheat growing here. I was there once and tall Corn was 
growing.<br/>
