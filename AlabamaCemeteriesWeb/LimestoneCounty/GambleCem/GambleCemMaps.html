<b>This road map shows the cemetery south of Athens very near Exit 340. To get 
here Go I-65 &amp; take Exit 340 onto I-565 east and go to Mooresville Exit 2 (2 
miles) and go north about 3/4 mile to Bibb-Garret Road. Take that west or left 
almost to I-65 to NW Endeavor Way into the Industrial park. Turn south there and 
stop and ask for permission to visit this cemetery at the plant which owns the 
surrounding land (to stay out of jail, just kidding, but active guards are 
maintained around the clock here.)<br/>

Turn onto NW Venture Circle and go around behind the cemetery which cannot be 
seen from NW Endeavor Way because it is behind a Leland Cypress Hedge. The 
cemetery is under a Cell Tower and the grounds are maintained inside a fence. <br/>
