</b></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">John Alan Milhous was a native of Camden, Kershaw Co. S.C. and son of 
John Milhous and Anna Stewart Milhous. He was the husband of Tabitha Burk Powell 
Milhous. He was a primitive Baptist minister who preached for years in the 
Wooley Springs vicinity. "On 18 Sep 1855, Thomas Hobbs recorded: "Went to a 
Hardshell Baptist meeting. Messrs. Milhous and Crutcher preached....After two 
sermons we had communion and the washing of feet. It was the first time I ever 
saw the latter exercise. Crutcher took off his coat, girded himself with apron, 
and washed Mill's (sic) feet from a large pewter basin; then his own were washed 
by M. and then the laity participated. The ladies were engaged in another part 
of the house." THE LURE &amp; LORD OF LIMESTONE COUNTY Published by Limestone County
