This map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Johnson Cemetery #1. This is also known as the
Latitude and Longitude location. Another location method is: Section 23 Township 
1 Range 3, Northeast 
Quarter of the Northwest Quarter. Athens/Limestone County Archives can issue you a map 
for $4 that makes 
this useful to find Cemetery &amp; other assets.</b><b><br/>

Go east to north on Hwy 251 (old Hwy 31) several miles to Johnson Road. Turn east (right) there and 
go about 1/2 mile and merge onto Johnson Cemetery Road. Follow that 1/4 mile and 
before the road bends southeast the cemetery is in front of you.</b><b>  <img border="0" height="473" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/JohnsonCem1/JohnsonCem1Aerial.jpg" width="1019"/><br/>
This aerial view uses a yellow pointer to
show the cemetery located under a stand of trees. It is inside a gated 
chain link fence, and well groomed as a community cemetery.<br/>
