This cemetery was completely destroyed in the fierce F-5 Tornado of 27 Apr 2011. </font></b></font> <a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/Davis(Nick)Cem/IMG_5204.JPG">5204</a><font color="#800000"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
This powerful storm swept in from eastern Mississippi all the way to the 
northwest to Madison County AL about 90 miles away and killed some 50 people. Since I live within 
3 miles of this place after the tornado I came here to visualize the 
extent of the damage. It was terrible. The big monument was fallen and buried in 
among about 50 tones of fallen trees and other debris. That is to say nothing 
about three homes within 500 yards of this place which were completely 
demolished. I pondered that situation 
and told as many folks about it as would listen to me allowing time for the taking 
care of the terrible situation that the people in the neighborhood suffered. As 
a type A impatient person I finally got tired of 
the usual waiting around and went there with every tool in my arsenal and 
started clearing the logs and tree limbs that completely engulfed this site. I 
piled the brush and cut up the logs into small pieces so I could lift them. I 
carried all that out next to the road for the Storm Damage crew to haul away.</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b><i> </i>
After several hours of Chain saw &amp; bush whacker work and and piling brush I had the debris 
cleared off the monument and a pathway cleared out to the road so one could walk 
back to the fallen cemetery monument. </b></font></font><a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/Davis(Nick)Cem/IMG_5229.JPG">5229</a></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>So by 
now the public could at least see that there was a very large monument in there 
and that the tall spire was lying on the ground and needed attention. </b></font><a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/Davis(Nick)Cem/IMG_5219.JPG">5219</a><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b> So 
I took another break and called the FEMA storm damage people and anyone else that 
would listen. By that time several weeks had passed and all the neighbors who had 
suffered immensely had been given help so I  did not feel guilty for 
putting monuments to the dead above  survivors.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#800000"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>
It was about there that I realized Mr. Superman was not so super by himself and 
that I would never clean this up and reset a 5 ton monument by myself with no 
major heavy equipment.<br/>
I also noticed a large chunk of the corner was broken off the monument very near 
where the inscription resided and actually the inscription was chipped. These 
were lying on the ground nearby. This might even cause 
the inscription to peel off even more if something was not done. </b></font></font><a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/Davis(Nick)Cem/IMG_5220.JPG">5220</a><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"> 
T</font></b><font color="#800000"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">his old retired 
doer with 
much time on his hands spring into action again. I went back home and dug up my supplies of white 
concrete, hydrated lime and white sand. I came back with the tools to make up a 
soft 500 lbs per sq inch concrete mixture that would adhere to the stone (and hopefully last). I had 
been taught this process by Dan Sumner Allen IV who was an understudy of the 
historical caretakers based at Middle Tennessee State U. I made the repairs and 
formed the substance on and it adhered very well. In which case I shaped it into 
the original form to fill the fracture. I went back a couple of 
times to make sure it did not dry too quickly and set up cracking. I even sanded 
it some to smooth the roughness out.

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Thus the repair looked sound and still 
does, but the truth is in the hundreds of years it is supposed to last, but I do 
know the soft mortars adhere better and flex with the weather better than 
anything else.</font></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Thanks 
to a secret helping angel I went back there one day and found that the monument was standing 
again. Someone had brought in a crane and lifted it back onto the base. They 
also did some grounds repair but more was needed to bring the site up to the 
original look.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Now we 
had a standing stone </font></b><a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/LimestoneCounty/Davis(Nick)Cem/IMG_5284.JPG">5284</a> <b>
<font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">that looked about as good as the original but 
as stated the area was 
still fraught with holes in the ground from fallen trees and old root balls etc. That all just 
took away from the appearance of the historic monument. I kept doing small 
things myself to make some difference and then one day several months later the mysterious angel visited the 
place again and graded the surface and pushed up all the tree stumps and hauled 
them off so that today the Nick Davis Monument is again about as good as 
new. Since I was never there when they were it was is still is a mystery who did 
the pick up of the stone and final clearing and grading of the site. (For the 
final clearing I have no photo.)</font></b></p>
