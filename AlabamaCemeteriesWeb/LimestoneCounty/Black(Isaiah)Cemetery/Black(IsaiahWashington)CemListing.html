2 Mar 1850&nbsp; - 1 Feb 1897. &quot;An honest man is the noblest work of
God.&quot; (Son of John &amp; Winnie Hite Peace Black, their seventh child;
brother who was Alexander Black bears the name of the other cemetery along this
road; Fragments of that cemetery can be found but it is largely destroyed by 
vandals.)<br>

<p><font size="2">The latest Cemetery book is wrong. It has the cemetery about 5
miles north of this place. The township is T1S and should be T2S and the section
is wrong in that it should be 10. Their descriptions of who is buried there in
unmarked graves could be correct as I did see about 3 or more unmarked graves.
Fortunately I found another Limestone Cemetery book that had this information
correct.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Birdsong (maiden name Rogers) lived in the house just west of here for 70
years. She was told that there were seven graves in the cemetery, 2 adults and 5
children.&nbsp; The other adult aside from Isaiah Black is believed to be a
government official sent in when the area was first settled.&nbsp;<br>
Due to the dense brush I was unable to make a confirmation of the unmarked
graves. [WA 21 Oct 2009]</font></p>

Other sources: Mentioned on page 37 in the book Limestone County Alabama Cemeteries.
by Smith 2003. In this book the location is bad so don't follow that. Another
earlier book was found to have more accurate information regarding location.
Information also came from the Black Family History published in the book
&quot;Descendents of John Black&quot; , page 15, by Danny Black. 31 Aug 2002.</font></i></p>
