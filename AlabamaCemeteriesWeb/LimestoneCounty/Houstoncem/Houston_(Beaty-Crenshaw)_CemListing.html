I am not aware of why this is called the Houston Cemetery. Could it be that 
there are Houstons' buried here without markers or under destroyed markers. This 
graveyard was no doubt larger than the area it is allotted now. Years of tilling 
the surrounding soil has eroded the adjacent depth of the area and and left the 
cemetery perched upon a small hill. This is a typically abused cemetery by a 
large farming operation and common in rural cemeteries but never understandable. 
Linda Smith said she found trash being burned at the end of the stones during 
her 1990 visit. That heat from a fire would explain the stones crumbling if it 
were close enough to the stones. <br/>
