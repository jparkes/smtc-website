<b>This road map show the cemetery can be accessed by going south on Mooresville 
Road to the old Hwy 20 and turn (left) east there. Go past Greenbrier to the 
Segers Rd and turn (left) north. After you pass over the railroad tracks on 
Segers Rd look to your right and you will see a small thicket of trees far out in 
the field but close to the railroad tracks. The cemetery is in that grove of 
trees. <br/>
Actually the best way to access this cemetery is from Highway 20. Turn into the 
new Gas Pipeline access (gravel) road about 500 yards east of the intersection 
of Segers Road &amp; Old Highway 20 and go north. Go by the Pipeline station and 
cross the railroad tracks. Immediately after crossing the tracks you will be on 
a field road. Turn right and follow parallel with the rails on the west side and 
on the east side of the large soy bean/cotton/wheat field. In dry weather only, 
go up the hill about 200 yards and park. Look left and the cemetery is due north 
of you in the field in the round clump of trees as shown on the aerial map 
below. You cannot go there in the growing season without harming the crops so 
plan on visiting this cemetery in November or December and usually no one will 
care. However if wheat is being planted then that may be growing in the winter. 
Well if all else fails check with the (owner) farmer.</b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b><br/>

the north </span>side of the rail road tracks and is pointed out by a yellow 
pointer out in a Soy bean, wheat, or cotton field. Highway 20 is not shown on 
this map but runs along the bottom of the map out of view. <br/>
What you are seeing on this map running at an angle is the Rail Road tracks. 
Visit this cemetery by walking across the field. Thus you will not harm the 
growing land by running a vehicle over it.<br/>
