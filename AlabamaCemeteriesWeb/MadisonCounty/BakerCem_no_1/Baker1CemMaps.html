From Huntsville go northeast on Winchester Rd to New Market and turn right on 
Hurricane Road. Go to Upper Hurricane Rd and turn right or east. That almost 
immediately dead ends into Dodson Lane Upper Hurricane Rd. After turning right 
(south) there look to your left upon the slope into the trees about 300 yards 
from the road across a cattle pasture at the cemetery in the distance. I am sure 
there is a locked gate at the cemetery road to secure the cattle.<br/>

This aerial view shows a yellow highlighted outline of the cemetery premises, 
but as I say I missed some of the stones so maybe stones were all thru that tree 
covered thicket possibly outside the fence.<br/>
