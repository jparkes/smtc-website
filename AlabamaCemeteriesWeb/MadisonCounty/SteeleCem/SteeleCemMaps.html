This aerial map shows the GPS of the Steel Cemetery as N 34.97977 X W -86.40855. 
Alternate Locator: Section 3 Township 1s Range 2E - NE NW SW SW, 

[[interpreted as the SW (1/4, corner) of Section 3 and the South West (1/4, 
corner) of that square and the Northwest (1/4, corner) of that square and the 
Northeast (1/4, corner) of that square. <i>I never understood why the experts 
set these readings up backwards. Maybe it was to eliminate the dummies (me 
included) from reading maps</i>.]]
Located at Steele Crossing on Winchester Pike about 5 miles north of New Market, 
Alabama, on east side of road in clump of trees.</b><b>  </b>

From Huntsville Hwy 231 North go out Winchester Rd several miles. Pass thru New 
Market and go about another 5 miles and when the road bends sharply to the right 
begin looking for the clump of trees on the right which contains the cemetery.<br/>
