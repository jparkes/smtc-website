This map shows the GPS of
the Adams-Crutcher Cemetery as N 34.90731 W -86.78379. Alternate Location: 
Section 31-Range 1S, Township 2W, W/2 W/2 SW. This tiny family cemetery is 
located on the Madison County side of the Madison-Limestone County line. To get 
to it one must walk approximately one-half mile off the main road.

 Go out Hwy 53 to Bethel Road on the left and Ready Section Road on the 
right. Turn left on Bethel Road and go about 1/2 mile to Jade Road 
and turn left again. Follow that until it dead ends. You will need permission and ability to 
get past gates and continue your direct southward path, but if you can continue 
when you come to the 
east/west fence row about 1/4 mile further the cemetery is across the fence row on the 
(left) Madison County side of the 
north/south fence. The land owner you have chosen to travel to this cemetery is different 
from the land owner owning the surrounding cemetery land. Another way is to 
follow the field road turning right just before the last farm house and bend 
around in a half circular manner back to the cemetery realizing there are more 
gates &amp; fences that way than the other way. Also that road ends at the last 
fence crossing. Any other route to this cemetery will require crossing a creek.<br/>

Notice the rough outline indicating the cemetery location occupying an area 
under the hardwood trees, but not the junipers or in the green foliage. This is 
only an approximation of the land area of this cemetery.<br/>
