Go west on Hwy 72 past Madison and turn north on Balch Road. Travel Balch Road 
about 400 yards and the cemetery entrance is on the left. You will see the 
metal cattle gate with the sign on it. There is a gravel road up to the cemetery about 
200 yards west. Fletcher Cemetery an African American Cemetery is 
about 300 yards southwest of this cemetery now next to Wal-Mart. The Clift 
Cemetery shown on this map has been moved to the Old Madison City Cemetery. The 
Holder cemetery also has been moved but to the Maplewood Cemetery in Huntsville. 
The Donaldson Cem still exist but the bank above the road covering the graves is 
eroding away. The Toney Cemetery on this map exist no longer best I can tell. At 
least I cannot find it.<br/>

The yellow pointer denotes the location of the cemetery on the west side of 
Balch Road. It is 
under a grove of trees.<br/>
