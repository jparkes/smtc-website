 On Winchester Road turn right (east) on County Lake Road. Follow that until 
you find Hurricane Creek Road which turns right. So turn right (south) and go 
about 3 miles and the old Bone Plantation home is on your left. With permission 
walk north of the home toward the pasture and the cemetery is between the yard 
and pasture inside a concrete cinder block wall about as far from the road as 
the home.<br/>

This is a Google Street View of the old Bone home. The 
cemetery is just north (our left) of this view out in a pasture behind a cinder 
block wall.<br/>
