Go out Winchester Road to Riverton Road and turn left. Travel until it 
becomes (turn right) Macon Lane and follow that north for just over two miles and look 
to your right upon the bank of the road at the two stones which may be covered 
in brush at times when no one clears them as I did. It is between a white 
graveled turnoff into a field and a utility pole. You 
will see the concrete &amp; rocks set in place to keep the grave assets from sliding 
down the embankment.<br/>

This is a clear image of the two stones standing on the bank of the road. 
A Rev. War Plaque is celebrating William Pettey's efforts here was set by the 
Hunts Spring National Association of the Daughters of the American Revolutionary 
War. It is set beside 
the rock wall facing the public. When I was here it did not seem to be very well 
anchored as the bolts appeared to be rusting away. If is fails the plaque will be found just 
below the stone of William Pettey down toward the ditch. Reset it on William 
Pettey's stone next time using brass fittings, not (rust) steel.<br/>
