This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Clopton Cemetery as GPS N 34.81047 X W 86.48853. Alternate Location: Section 
2 Township 3S Range 1E, NW NE, Approx. 1/4 mi. off Homer Nance Road in a 
subdivision on Still Cove Dr. under trees.<br/>

Go out Winchester Road northwest and turn south (right) on Homer Nance Rd and go 
to Rivershore Dr. and turn left (east) Follow that to Manor House Dr and turn 
north (left). Follow that to a left turn on Still Cove Dr. then pass two houses 
on the left and the cemetery occupies the next lot under a grove of trees.<br/>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location occupying one of the lots 
in this subdivision. This cemetery is unmarked by Google, but has the Clopton 
Cemetery name placed on what appears to me to be the Friends Cemetery #1 on 
nearby Alpha Lane just west of this place. Friends Cemetery #1 (my name for it) 
is accessible from Naugher Rd and appears to be an African American Cemetery. I 
was told that graves were dug up and removed to somewhere else from that 
cemetery by the neighbors, but the information was vague and no specifics were 
offered.<br/>
