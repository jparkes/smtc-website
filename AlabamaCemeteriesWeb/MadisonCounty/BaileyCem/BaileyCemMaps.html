BAILEY-CRUTCHER 
CEMETERY, (Subdivision south of Mill Road, Madison Al.), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br/>

This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Bailey Cemetery. Notice the nearby Whitworth Cemetery on the above map. The 
GPS coordinates are confused on these maps between the two. There are no stones 
with the Whitworth surname inscribed on them in the Bailey Cemetery. The GPS on 
the Whitworth Cemetery coordinates are 34.6981 X -86.7825. No matter what 
version of map you use, trying to analyze the differences between these two 
cemeteries' GPS coordinates compared to where they actually are is confused at 
best. I have the correct location on the below aerial map regardless of errors 
in the GPS.<br/>

 At the 
intersection of County Line &amp; Mill Roads go east toward downtown Madison 2 
tenths of a mile and turn right into the new subdivision road Withers Junction. 
Go until it terminates into Cedar Springs Place and then turn left &amp; take that 
until the road junctions with South Brooks Place. Stop there as the cemetery is 
on your right up under the trees. Vandals beware - the neighbors &amp; Madison 
Police are watching you.<br/>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location occupying some of the lots 
in this subdivision.<br/>
