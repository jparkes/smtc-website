<font color="#000066">A couple of the headstones, that for Josiah D. Battle the 
father, and Lon Battle, a son, are fallen and are missing with the footstone and 
grave still found. Likely what has happened is the headstones have fallen and 
sunken into the grave pits. To find them a probe is needed and lots of patience 
to probe over a wide area around the footstone. In most cases the stone will be 
4 or less inches under the soil, but can be as  deep as six inches unless a 
big tree has fallen and the root ball sucked an impacted stone off into the pit 
and has covered it. In that case the stone may be as deep as 4 feet underground. 
To find that it is necessary to have sonar equipment. Also missing from this 
survey was the stone of Ann E. Henderson. This may have been an unmarked grave 
from the Madison County Cemetery book Volume I, however it also may be lost 
below the top of the ground. [CWA 26 Jan 2013]<br/>
