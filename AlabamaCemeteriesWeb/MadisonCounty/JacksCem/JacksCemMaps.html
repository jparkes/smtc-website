This aerial view shows an outline of the cemetery premises. All of the graves 
are facing east with the foot toward the east. This is not due east but an 
easterly direction known to the residents not map experts, thus the slight cant 
to the south in the cemetery direction. Mapping experts can explain this in a technical 
manner, but the difference is in the polar magnetic direction compared to due 
east on a map.<br/>
