RATHBONE, RUFUS COGSWELL, (b. circa 1779) In Memory of Rufus Cogswell Rathbone 
who departed this life January the 12th, 1842, aged 61 years. Farewell my wife 
and children dear, I am not dead but sleeping here; hoping in that great day to 
rise, to meet my Savior in the skies. (To properly read this inscription one 
must go to this cemetery and slide the two broken parts close together to match 
them up. The inscription will then become clearer. If you attempt this be extra 
careful not to bump the two parts together or you could cause further damage to 
this soft limestone. Also leave space between the parts to keep the expansion of 
heat and cold from causing them to touch and thus wear away the frayed ends.)<br/>
