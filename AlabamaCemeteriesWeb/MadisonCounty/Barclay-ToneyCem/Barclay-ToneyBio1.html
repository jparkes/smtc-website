Mildred Spicer (Noble) Aikin married Cyrus S. Aikin 3 Apr 1833.<br>
<br>
I am related through marriage to Milly S. Akin… her husband Cyrus Samuel Aikin 
is a 1st cousin 6x removed. <br>
<br>
Per my family research, Milly’s full name was: Mildred Spicer Noble, a daughter 
of George Washington Noble and the former Elizabeth Spicer. Known by all as 
Milly, she married Cyrus Samuel Aikin on April 3rd 1833 (as you mention). <br>
<br>
Milly was a sister to Clarissa Harriett [Noble] Toney, wife of Harris Toney; 
whose memorial you created. Another sister, Elizabeth Spicer Noble, was married 
to Cyrus Aikin’s older brother, William Audley Aikin. <br>
<br>
I know there are several Alabama Marriage records, giving her name as Milly S. 
Aikin… this I believe is a transcript deviation. In the will of Milly’'s father… 
it states: <br>
“William A. Aiken and wife Elizabeth S., Harris Toney and wife Clarissa H.; 
Lawrence S. Banks and wife Margaret J.; Cyrus A. Aiken and wife Mildred S.; 
James M. Noble and George Noble of Madison County…” listing his daughters and 
their husbands, as well as two sons. <br>
<br>
A side note: <br>
Matilda N. Barclay is the daughter of Harris &amp; Clarissa Toney. Charles A. Toney 
is the son of Harris &amp; Clarissa Toney. Martha E. [Toney] Coons is also a 
daughter of Harris &amp; Clarissa Toney. <br>
