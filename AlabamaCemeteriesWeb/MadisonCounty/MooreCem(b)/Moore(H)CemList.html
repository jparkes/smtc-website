<font color="#000080"><b>Other graves may exist here but the cattle have damaged the ability to find them 
as they roam freely in this graveyard. This graveyard at one time had a nice 
wrought iron fence surrounding at least some of the graves. However the fence 
has been trampled by the livestock and no longer separates the graves from the 
cattle, and the only grave that can be clearly identified is for Herman Moore.  
This grave yard served as a slave graveyard at one time for the old Moore 
Plantation. The home was situated on the north side of the road whereas the 
graveyard is south of the Harvest Road.  Only the good Lord knows the 
number of unmarked graves here under these trees . The little iron fence 
probably at one time surrounded the Herman Moore and Hammond monuments. The land 
owner told me her deceased husband allowed burials here until about 1950 and 
then ceased to allow any more of them. Does not sound legal, except there was 
probably an issue with the deed. The road was probably discontinued and those 
using it as a burial ground did not supply memorials to make a formal graveyard.</b></font></p>
