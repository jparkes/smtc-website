From Madison on Hwy 72 travel north on Wall Triana Highway to Harvest and turn 
left (west) on Harvest Road. Follow that about a mile. This is past Carroll Rd. 
Go about 4 tenths of a mile past Carroll Road and stop at the home in front of 
the thicket which can be seen from the road to get permission to travel back to 
this cemetery. It is about 200 yards from the road. The finger like line of 
trees (seen below) pointing north follows a dry gulch that goes beside the west 
edge of the cemetery. The cemetery is on the bank of that dry creek bed.<br/>

This close up aerial view shows the cemetery marked with a red check on the west 
edge of the thicket. 
I would advise you not to go looking all over that big thicket, but to focus on 
the red check that I have drawn up here. It is exact. The Harvest Road is north of the 
cemetery. <br/>
