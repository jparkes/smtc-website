Hurricane Valley<br/>
 was known in early times as a place where the natives could escape and live 
private lives away from the movement of the white settlers. It was remote 
situated between two mountains with a quant little creek to supply water for 
plenty of life. Soon the settlers discovered this place and moved there 
co-mingling with natives and cross marrying to produce a population that was 
part native and part white settler among all others. These folks were fiercely 
loyal to their lands and families and produced great wealth by farming the 
valuable rich bottom lands of Hurricane Valley. Gradually the influence of the 
natives were diminished as the Cherokee took to the roads and followed their 
tribesman west, but some of that 
influence remains today. <br/>
The name Hurricane valley was brought about by the 
frequent violet tornados that swept thru the valley. In early times the settlers 
called all storm Hurricanes. For more details see the book "History of Hurricane 
Valley" in the Archives of Huntsville - Madison County Library.</b></i></p>
