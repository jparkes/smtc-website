Tallushatchee and Talladega (3 and 9 November 1813)<br>
<br>
&quot;Less than fifteen miles from Fort Strother lay the Creek village of 
Tallushatchee, where a large body of Red Sticks had assembled. Jackson ordered 
General John Coffee, along with a thousand mounted men, to destroy the town. On 
the morning of 3 November 1813, Coffee approached the village and divided his 
detachment into two columns: the right composed of cavalry under Colonel John 
Alcorn and the left under the command of Colonel Newton Cannon. The columns 
encircled the town and the companies of Captain Eli Hammond and Lieutenant James 
Patterson went inside the circle to draw the Creeks into the open. The ruse 
worked. The Creek warriors charged the right column of Coffee's brigade, only to 
retreat to their village where they were forced to make a desperate stand. 
Coffee's army overpowered the Creeks and quickly eliminated them.&quot;<br>
Captain Eli Hammond, the Indian fighter, who also was in the Nickajack 
expedition of 1794.<br>
