At the 
intersection of Wall Triana go east on Harvest Road to West Highland Road. Turn 
south (or right) there and go 2/3 mile to Robins Road and turn left (east). Turn 
north on Stoney Point Drive (subdivision Rd) and go about 1/4 mile and when the 
road bend eastward look right and you will see the thicket of trees where the 
cemetery is located. It is hard to get into this cemetery because of the brush. 
Go there only in the winter. The cemetery site belongs to the gentleman toward 
the dne of the street on the left. This is private land so 
permission should be acquired.<br/>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location. Amy who lives in the 
house south of there has adopted and therefore made it her mission to accumulate 
the available history on this historic cemetery. You will need the land owner's 
and her intelligent consent to take any action on this cemetery other than to 
survey.<br/>
