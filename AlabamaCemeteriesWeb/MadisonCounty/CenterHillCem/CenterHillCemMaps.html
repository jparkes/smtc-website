This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Center Hill Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. It is on the Madison County side of the Love Branch/County 
Line Road.<br/>
<img border="0" height="628" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/MadisonCounty/CenterHillCem/CenterHillCemRd.jpg" width="1001"/> From 
Harvest Al go west on Harvest Road to County Line/Love Branch Road and  
turn north (right) and go about one mile and pass a new residential road on the 
right. The cemetery is in the northeast corner of that intersection about 50 
yards north of the new road and 70 yards east of Love Branch Road. The graves 
are lined up north and south over about a 50 yard long area.<br/>

From this aerial view marked with a red check we see the directions to the 
cemetery just north of the new road.<br/>

Zooming in on this view shows the cemetery under the tall trees but inside the 
forest line outlined with a yellow border (not a legal boundary)<br/>
