In the 1930's Kathleen Paul Jones and Pauline Jones Gandrud compiled a record of 
many of the old cemeteries in Madison County. Fortunately, the Wilburn is<br>
one they copied and Mrs. Gandrud gave permission to Dorothy Scott Johnson to use her records:<br>
<br>
<font size="4">WILBURN, JAMES, </font>Born January 10, 1789 - died January 29, 
1846.*<br>
<font size="4">WILBURN, SALLY M., </font>Born 23, 1790 - died 19, 1857.*<br>
<font size="4">WILBURN, FREDERICK B., </font>Son of James and Sally Wilburn. 
Born March 27, 1826, died September 17, 1850.*<br>
<br>
*This cemetery was completely 
destroyed by a previous land owner many years ago prior to 1978. Most of the 
stones were hauled to a nearby house and laid into a driveway. Dorothy Scott 
Johnson dug up the stones but the inscriptions had been worn off from many years 
of use. Rock tombs surrounded by rock walls are still in existence in this 
cemetery, but all identification is gone. Even though this is called the Wilburn 
Cemetery there are several other families represented here including a young 
woman named Taft, according to a local resident.<br>
