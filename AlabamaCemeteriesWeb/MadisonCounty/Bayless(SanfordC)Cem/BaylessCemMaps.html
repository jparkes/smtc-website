This aerial map shows the GPS of
the Bayless (Sanford) Cemetery of Madison Alabama as N 34.84318 X W -86.46310. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map under the white check.
</font><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
Alternate Location: Section 30, Township 2 Range 2E, N/2 NW NW. This means the 
north one half of section 30 then draw a box halving that and select the north 
west part of that and then draw a box selecting the northwest part of that and 
the cemetery is inside that box. This translates to mean the northwest corner of 
section 30 in a forty acre area of that 640 acre section. However the cemetery 
is fenced in about 1/5 of an acre.</font><font color="#008000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"> 
Another description of the location says behind a decaying barn on the west side 
of Winchester Pike approximately at the Winchester Pike and County Lake Road 
intersection. Also in the north section of Hale Blvd and Winchester Road. Hale 
Blvd is a residential road that serves several houses. Gates are locked to this 
cemetery.</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br/>

At the 
intersection of Highway 231/431 North, at the Winchester Pike go out Winchester 
Pike 5+ miles to a Hale road on your left Turn there and go about 300 yards to a 
gate and with permission, a key to the gate, and instructions on how not to 
disturb the cattle, go due north past the old barn to the cemetery about 175 
yards from the gate. There are alternate entrances to the livestock fenced area 
where this cemetery resides.<br/>

Notice the labeling under the tree line but west of the old barn seen as a brown 
color to the southeast of the cemetery.<br/>
