From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd several miles and turn north (left) on 
Riverton Road. Go 2 miles and the road eventually ends on Macon Lane. Turn right 
there and go about a mile and with advanced permission go to the left behind the 
house of the home owner where the cemetery is inside a fence. Please respect 
privacy rights and the private assets all around you here and do not have a 
constant stream of people going here.<br/>

This close up aerial view shows a red check in the center of the cemetery 
premises. I have mostly faded the private assets. If you go here leave a card or 
something to let the home owner know who your are and your reason for being here. 
They are doing a great job of caring for this cemetery and deserve your utmost 
respect for their privacy. It is my policy not to release names or phone numbers 
in this instance.<br/>
