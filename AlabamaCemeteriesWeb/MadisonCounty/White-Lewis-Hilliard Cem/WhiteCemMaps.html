This topographical map shows the GPS of
the White Cemetery of Madison Alabama. as N 34.81175 X W -86.72333. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. <br/>

At the 
intersection of Old Railroad Bed Road and Nick Davis Road travel east past Wall 
Triana Highway 1 and 1/2 miles to Mystic Way (subdivision road) Turn north and go 
to Skylane Blvd. Turn left or west and go about a mile to the end of that 
street. Park there &amp; inform any outside neighbors of your intention. If there is 
now a house at the end of that street you will need to find another 
access.  The house where permission can be granted is south of the cemetery 
about 200 yards. Otherwise the cemetery is in the forest about 100 yards past 
the end of Skylane Blvd under the large pine trees. It is 40 yards northeast of 
a small barn building.<br/>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location in the forest west of a 
major subdivision. Notice a large pond lies to the north of the cemetery. The 
red check may be as much as 50 feet off.<br/>

With this clearer view we see the cemetery at the end of the Culdasac and no 
private yards to cross to visit, only private land. That could change at any 
time. We can see the cemetery southeast of the barn and deep into the woods. An 
elderly gentleman lives south of this place whom I will not name, but he owns 
the land surrounding this cemetery and has taken an interest in the cemetery in 
the past.<br/>
