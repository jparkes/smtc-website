"A letter written by our Father C. C. Carroll to Johnnie, Martha, and Sammie."<br/>
<br/>
June 11, 1864<br/>
<br/>
My Dear Little Children;<br/>
<br/>
I now take up my pen for the first time in my life to write you a few lines to 
let you know that your Pa dearly loves you and to let you know that I am well at 
this time and hope these few lines will reach you in due time and find you and 
your dear Mother enjoying the best of health and all the blessing of an all wise 
and all merciful God or Father and I pray for you as one that loves you dearly 
that the great God of mercy may throw the mantle of his redeeming love around 
you and shield and protect you from all harm and danger and that He may imprint 
in your hearts while yet young and tender to love and fear him, our great and 
blessed Savior and I ask you as a Father that loves his children to remember, 
(when you grow old enough) that you have a blessed Savior in Heaven, that he has 
protected from birth down to the present time and I ask you to give him thanks 
for his kind blessings and tender mercies that he has already bestowed upon you 
dear children. Again I ask you to respect and obey your Ma and Grandpa and 
Grandma, and all your Aunts who are with you for I am satisfied that they will 
teach you nothing contrary to the worship and will of God.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda I ask you as a kind and obedient and dearest of all this world to me, to 
keep this letter and read it to your little children often when they grow old 
enough to know what it means, and teach them to pray, and I ask you all to pray 
and pray with out ceasing for it the righteous scarcley is saved where will the 
unholy sinners appear.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Children if I never see your faces again you will know my fealing toward 
you, though I trust in the Almighty God, His will be done not mine. May God 
bless and save you all is my prayer for Christ sake.<br/>
<br/>
I remain you loving Father till death.<br/>
<br/>
C. C. Carroll<br/>
