At the 
intersection of Wall Triana Highway and Madison Pike go east on Madison Pike to 
Shelton Road and turn south (right) and go to Alderwood Dr and turn left and go 
to the bend of the road and turn right and go to the end of the dead end street 
and park. Follow the street into the woods 15 yards and turn due east (or left) 
and walk 350 yards east to the cemetery. Since this is all private land get 
permission. Stay in the woods though and do not cross the neighbor's grassy 
lawns.<br/>

Notice the instructions here for getting to this cemetery. You must have 
permission to use any route as this cemetery is far from the usual driving 
routes. There is another 
route but it is from Madison Pike and is a long field road. In most times of 
the year you will need a four wheel drive to use that route<br/>
