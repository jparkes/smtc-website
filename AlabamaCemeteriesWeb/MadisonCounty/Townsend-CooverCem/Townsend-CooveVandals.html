TOWNSEND-COOVER 
CEMETERY, (Hwy 231, Hazelgreen, Madison, Al.), MADISON COUNTY, ALABAMA<br/>
<img border="0" height="639" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/MadisonCounty/Townsend-CooverCem/Townsend-Coover-AerialMap.JPG" width="1600"/><br/>
Here we see a MS Bing image of the cemetery in a plowed field. There does 
not appear to be any major damage to the cemetery when this map was made back 
about three years ago. <br/>

This is a Google version of the above map - made in the early spring and still the 
stones are about all standing. <br/>

This is a blow up of the above MS Bing map showing the stones and the damage from the 
vandalism. Most all the tombs have shown signs damage from time &amp; the elements, with fallen 
monuments etc, but the vandalized ones are obliterated beyond repair.<br/>

From the bottom right detailing up the row: <br/>
The Peter T. &amp; W.H. Coover Obelisk stones appear o be standing above, but have now been 
pushed over and lie on the ground, both pointing eastward as seen in the photos.<br/>
The Solomon Coover stone has fallen in the past and today is standing against 
its base.<br/>
The Marthy Jane Coover stone is still standing.<br/>
The Lethia M. Coover stone is standing<br/>
The Sallie Coover &amp; Parks Townsend monument has fallen and is no longer standing 
except for the inscribed blocks, but this may not be the damage of vandals.<br/>
Next row eastward:<br/>
The Muntford R. Townsend stone has been severely vandalized. The thick 6" stone 
lid is broken into many fragments by the blows of criminal vandals. They were 
stupid enough to think there was treasure or a body behind the lid. Neither is 
true in southern cemeteries. There are spiders, wasp and snakes though and I 
hope they reaped their share of those.<br/>

This photo was made by J. Preston back in 2006. the stone was still standing and 
in good order then.<br/>

This is the crushed parts of the Muntford R. Townsend box tomb today.<br/>
</font><font color="#CC3300" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
The Mary Ann Lucretia Townsend box tomb is broken and still stands together. Someone probably stacked it back together after the vandalism 
because the parts are not so heavy.<br/>
The Rebeca F. Townsend stone has been broken. The top is broken and removed from the 
base and the sides are falling inward.<br/>
The other three box tombs are covered by a large thicket of blackberry briars. 
As for me I don't plan on clearing them until it is a given the vandals will not return.<br/>
Whom ever did this dastardly deed used heavy tools, because these are some of 
the heaviest box tombs I have seen.<br/>
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
When found, I reported this vandalism to the Madison County Sheriff and they 
respectively took the report which I provided in detail. The officer also 
informed me that a teenager from the nearby High School had attacked this 
cemetery and caused the destruction a couple of years prior to my visit here. I 
was informed he had been prosecuted and punished and this was no longer an open 
case. </font></b><i><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br/>
