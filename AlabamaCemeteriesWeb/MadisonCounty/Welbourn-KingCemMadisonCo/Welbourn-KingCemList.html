<p>Nancy was the wife of Henry King 
and daughter of Isaac Welbourn King who lies in an unmarked grave along with 
other members of the family. This cemetery was destroyed when an adjacent 
service station was put in. Nancy Welborn King was thrown from a horse and 
killed. Her husband, Henry was a brother of William Whitfield King. After 
Nancy's death Henry went to South Alabama, married his cousin, died and is 
burled there. Henry was the son of Capt. Charles King. [Dorothy Johnson, 1978]</p>
