This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Bayless-Eddins Cemetery of Madison Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map. <br/>

At the 
intersection of Highway 72 and Old Rail Road Bed Road travel north several miles 
and go past Highway 53 (Ardmore Hwy). From Hwy 53 go two miles and when the road 
comes under tall trees turn left into the residential dead end road. Immediately 
cross the creek and the cemetery will be south to southwest of you about 200 
yards upon the rise and still into the edge of the woods. It is hard to find so 
go there only in the winter so you can find the massive monuments because they 
blend in with the tree trunks. Since this is private land all around get 
permission.<br/>

Notice the red check indicating the cemetery location of the two separate 
monuments occupying this woodland cemetery. While there I took out several small 
trees which should make the stones easier to see from a distance. <br/>
