ANTHONY, Mr.,</b> 
lies here - unknown. I (Dorothy Johnson), was told that a man was buried here by the name of Anthony. 
There is an Edy Anthony listed in the 1830 Census and if that was Mr. Anthony's 
wife he died before that time. When I 1st visited this cemetery in 1970 there was 
an unmarked grave (that of Mr. Anthony) surrounded by a cedar fence but when I 
went back In 1977 the fence was gone and the cemetery was terribly overgrown. 
Evidently because the grave was unmarked someone abolished that evidence. [DJ 
1978]<br/>

<b>The Bailes cemetery is situated on a hill side overlooking the beautiful Hurricane 
Creek and Valley. Several years ago when l first visited this cemetery it was 
well kept but in 1976 it bad become so overgrown with foliage it was almost 
impossible to get to the stones. [DJ 1976] Today the cemetery has been restored 
and many of the lost graves now have new markers similar to the original ones if 
they ever existed. Nice job! Someone! Today this cemetery is now a part of a 
large lot subdivision and is being kept up. [CWA 15 Apr 2014]<br/>
<br/>
* Some of you may ask why I presented those old broken stones. It is to show the 
history of this graveyard in that those were about the only stones left here in 
the year 1970 when Dorothy Johnson browsed this cemetery to present her book.<br/>
<br/>
This cemetery is known as 
the Bragg Cemetery on maps, but that is in error, but then again there are some folks 
with the surname Bragg who are known to live in this neighborhood and they are missing from the grave records of Madison County. 
Also this surname Bailes may be hte same name as Bayless but with different 
spelling. THe Bayless and Bragg families intermarried in that area. Specifically Sanford &amp; Elizabeth Ford Bragg 
are two graves missing but there are many others of those two families missing. 
There is some evidence there is an unmarked cemetery nearby on maps 
which may be a lost Bragg Cemetery, but then again that could be other Bragg's 
since that is a common surname in this valley. I am inclinded to believe now 
that the Bailes-Broyles Cemetery has unmarked graves that are now lost to us. [CWA 15 Apr 2014]<br/>
