This aerial map shows the GPS of the Whitman Cemetery. The location is 
indicated in the center of the map marked with a check at GPS N 34.90238 X W -86.42779. 
Alternate Locator: Section 5 Township 2 Range 2E, NE corner of the section. In 
New Market, Ala. on Jacks Road, just south of New Market, on west side of road, in 
thicket beside large metal privacy gate.<br/>

From Huntsville go out Winchester Rd several miles to New Market. Turn right 
(east) on Hurricane Road then turn back right again on Jacks Road. Follow that 
for about 1/4 mile and the cemetery is on your right on the edge of the road 
inside a thicket and behind a hog wire fence. This cemetery is on the road right of way 
and permission should not be required. However notification of neighbors is 
always a good thing.<br/>

This close up aerial view shows a red check marking the spot where the cemetery 
resides. 
There is no fence other than a partial hog wire fence to keep the public out. It 
is my judgment this cemetery is not on the property of the owner who built the 
recent home there nearby, but on the property of the folks south of there.<br/>
