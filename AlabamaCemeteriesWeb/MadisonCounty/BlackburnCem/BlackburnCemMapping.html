 At the 
intersection of Winchester Rd (Hwy 65) and County Lake Road go east about 1/2 
mile on County Lake Road and turn south (right) on Maysville Road. Follow that 
for about 3/4 mile and look west (right) at the clump of trees where this cemetery can 
be found. Park your vehicle on the field road.<br/>

This street view from Google shows the clump of trees where the cemetery exist clearly on the 
west side of 
Maysville Road. Careful here. A man that lives next to this cemetery has been 
encountering burglars recently and the burglars park here and invade their homes. 
Might want to go past this cemetery to their homes and tell them your 
intentions. I did not do this and they came out and hung over the fence under 
suspicion that I was a burglar. That was very strange encounter considering they 
had concealed guns and blood in their eyes. Probably better to call the law than 
try to convince a bunch of idiots with revenge on their minds in spite of the 
fact they did not own the property. After all graveyard visitors here are not 
very prevalent.<br/>
