<p align="center"><b>	HUTCHINGS CEMETERY, Carroll Road west side, MADISON COUNTY ALABAMA<a href="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/MadisonCounty/HutchingsCem/HutchingsCem-GPS.jpg"><img border="0" height="918" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlabamaCemeteriesImages/MadisonCounty/HutchingsCem/HutchingsCem-GPS.jpg" width="1708"/></a><br/>
This map shows the GPS of
the Hutchings Graveyard as N 34.84375 W -86.76784 inside the woodland west of 
Carroll Road 90 yards<br/>

Alternate Location: Section 30, Township 2S, Range 2 West, East 1/2, North East, 
North East, North East. Stated another way this cemetery is in the 
640 acre northeast quad of section 30, but the northeast quad of that square 160 
Acres and the 
northeast quad of that square 40 acres and the northeast quad of that square 10 
acres gets you 
pretty close. If you divided it again it would be in the southwest quad of this 
2 1/2 acres. Dividing this again would find the cemetery in the SE Quad of .625 
acres. This map above illustrates that with the deepest 10 acres quad/square 
illustrated being 
highlighted in yellow. As you can see the cemetery is just on the southern line 
of that last NE quad. It is amid a stand of trees on west side of Carroll Road 
and approx. 1/8 mile south of the Dorning Road intersection with Carroll Road. 
Approximately 90 yards due west into the woodland up the slope on private land. 
Stand facing the gate into the property and go due west following the private 
gravel road, then continue straight (due west) into the woodland and up the 
slope for the balance of the 90 yards and you will see the cemetery under the 
trees.<br/>

Go west out Hwy 72 to Old Railroad Bed Road and turn (right) north. Go past 
Capshaw Road, then Nick Davis Road. After a few more miles turn left (west) on 
Yarbrough Road. Carroll Road is the first road on the right. Take Carroll Road 
north (right) and after passing Holman Road junction on the right go about  
1/2 mile and start going down the hill into the Love Ditch valley. Near the 
bottom on your left you will notice a gate into private property with the gate 
locked. Stand facing the gate into the property and walk due west following the 
private gravel road at first, then continue due west into the woodland and up 
the slope for the balance of the 90 yards and you will see the cemetery under 
the trees about the top of the crest.<br/>

</b></i><b><font color="#000080">Standing on Carroll Road and looking west at the gate into the property that contains the 
Hutchings Cemetery. It is locked. One cannot drive there anyway. I took the 
photo looking due west in the direction of the cemetery unseen here 90 yards 
away. That thicket is not as bad as it looks unless you encounter a pack of 
wolves. The chances of that are about 1 in a billion if at all. Move to your 
right in the vegetation thins out but don't stray far from your "due westerly" 
direction.<br/>
