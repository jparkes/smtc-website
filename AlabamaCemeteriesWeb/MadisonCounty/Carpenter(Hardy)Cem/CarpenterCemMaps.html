This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Carpenter Cemetery. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map as marked at GPS N 34.89508 X W -86.69792 Specific Location: 
Section 2 Township 2S Range 2W. NE NE SE. On the barn grounds of the Bo Howard 
pig farm. Mr. Howard has carefully protected the stones at these graves.<br/>

On Hwy 231 go several miles north and turn left on Grimwood Rd. 
Go several miles and the road will merge onto Tony Rd. Take that and go about 1 
1/2 miles and turn south (left) on Bo Howard Rd. When the road bends left go 
straight ahead into the farm road and with permission to cross the locked gate 
follow that until the road bends back left (east). After bending left the 
cemetery will be on the left under a cedar tree behind some old Texas Bear Grass 
Cactuses that live for hundreds of years and were probably planted after the 
tombstones were set here. <br/>

This aerial view shows the cedar adn area where the cemetery is located but I 
think I have the red cross too far to our left. Should be moved over under the 
green Cedar tree about 10 feet.<br/>
