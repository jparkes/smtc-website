This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Gray Cemetery of Madison, Madison County Alabama. The location is indicated in the 
center of the map marked with the red check. This cemetery is labeled the Betts 
Cemetery on USGS maps but that is a later designation for the (black) graves 
south (I think) of the old (white) Gray cemetery. <br/>

</font><b><font size="2">This cemetery is located south of the Franklin Station 
subdivision and east of Balch Road Self Storage, a commercial business, in 
Madison, Alabama. To access the cemetery, travel north on Balch Road and turn 
east on Monument Lane. Travel east on Monument Lane to the first stop sign and 
turn south on Pennsylvania Avenue. Travel south on Pennsylvania Avenue and turn 
west on Annapolis Court. Travel west to the end of Annapolis Court and park in 
front of the house at 102 Annapolis Court being careful not to block anyone's 
driveway. Walk on the right side of the house (straight in front of youo) into 
the woods behind the house. When inside the woods turn left and the cemetery 
will be found scattered over the area 75 yards due north/south inside the woods 
about 40 yards west. The cemetery is overgrown and there are numerous sunken 
areas, holes, and other hazards.</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b><br/>
