I also believe Eleanor Carpenter Davidson , wife of Obadiah Davidson is buried

there that did not show up in Mr. Quillen's survey. Faye Bradford 18 Dec 2010.<br>

<font size="2">This small cemetery&nbsp; is not well maintained. Tree roots, 
livestock &amp; time has desecrated the stones in the past. This listing was 
originally completed by Harold Quillen of Florence and updated by Jan Hall and 
Faye Bradford &amp; Kent Pettus.&nbsp; I am told by other sources that the owner of the 
property Mr. J.C. Holt is a descendent 
of at least some of the interred of this graveyard. CWA. 18 Dec 2010. Revised 19

Sources: No known prior publication 
existed of this cemetery, except for that of Harold Quillen, deceased, who visited 
and worked 
up a manuscript of this and many cemeteries in 2003 of Colbert County Alabama. 
He donated that to the archives of 
Florence Alabama, where it resides today 16 Dec 2010. Added here initially by C. Wayne Austin 16 Dec 
2010. Revised 19 Dec 2012 to include the photo #001 thru 008 &amp; 012 by Jan Hall. 
and the personal #009, &amp; tombstone #010 photos supplied by Kent Pettus.
Revised listing to add Faye Bradford's family history and comments 17 Dec 2010 
(Enoch Carpenter, Abt 1770 - 31 Jul 1824. and Sarah Evans Carpenter, 1774 - 24 
Aug 1824, are related to her (Faye Bradford). Enoch was a brother to her 3rd great 
grandfather Hensley Carpenter. Family records state only that Enoch and Sarah 
were buried in a small cemetery in a field (across the road) close to the old Presb. Church on Old 
Brick Rd.) If you have helpful information on this cemetery let Faye know </font>

there and dig out the hidden dates of the Marshall H. Barnes. This cemetery is

different slant. [C.W.A. 20 Dec 2012.]</font></i></p>
