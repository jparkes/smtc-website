This topographical map shows the GPS of
the Harris Cemetery marked with a white/black cross. ACME Mapper 2.0 says these coordinates 
are: N 34.77999 W 87.99642. It is also in Section 28 of Range 2 Township 14. We 
have here the only GPS coordinates on this cemetery ever published. This was 
calculated using ACME Mapper 2.0 &amp; is not on the USGS.<br/>

To 
reach this cemetery from Cherokee go County Rd 10 Gilbert Lane northwest of 
Cherokee to within 200 
yards of crossing under the Natchez Trace and turn left (south, with permission) on 
Field Road. The cemetery is out in a open field due south of Field Road before it 
bends leftward. There are farm assets here and you must secure a way of crossing 
thru the fences and gates. That means contact with the land owner.

Notice the yellow pointer indicating the cemetery is located out in a field 
northwest of the small modern barn. It is marked with the yellow pointer and 
shows just a light color patch in the green.<br/>

This Google image expanded and slightly blown up shows the cemetery and is proof 
we have this cemetery pegged properly using Google Maps. One can see the four 
box tombs and one ornate child's tomb and also evidence someone is spraying weed 
killer to keep the cemetery clean of brush.<br/>
