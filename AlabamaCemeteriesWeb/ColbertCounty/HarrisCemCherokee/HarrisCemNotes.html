<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">HARRIS 
CEMETERY (NW of Cherokee) COLBERT COUNTY ALABAMA<br/>
</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
<br/>
This cemetery is located just northwest of Cherokee, Colbert County, AL. My 
(Jack) wife's grandmother, Lula Harris, owned this property for a short time 
around 1902. At that time <br/>
the farm consisted of 715 acres. Lula was only about 29 years old and we first 
assumed that she must have inherited it from some relative. We knew it was not 
from her parents <br/>
who both died young in North Carolina around 1881. After doing a lot of 
searching, we found that this Harris family had no connection with hers unless 
maybe back in England <br/>
prior to 1600. We finally found that Lula was living in the Cherokee area 
because after her parents' deaths, she went to live with her aunt, Sophronia 
Hearne, and her husband, <br/>
Thomas Alexander Sides, who had moved there from Stanly County, N.C. prior to 
1860. All moved to Hill County, TX about 1908. At that time T. A. Sides and his 
wife sold <br/>
about 2,600 acres of land in several plots mostly south of Cherokee and four lots 
in Cherokee.<br/>
<br/>
When we first saw the cemetery, we were surprised at the elaborate markers. We 
had expected to see some vertical slabs with writing that was mostly eroded 
away. Most of <br/>
these pictures show the general arrangement. They were taken in 1997. At that 
time the field was used as a pasture and the cattle kept it in good shape. The 
owner told <br/>
us that he bought the farm in the 1970s and at that time the cemetery was in 
very bad condition. There had been an old barn located near the cemetery and it 
had been <br/>
bulldozed down and pushed into the markers. He cleared away the debris and 
rebuilt the markers as best he could. There were a couple of markers that he 
could not find <br/>
their original location and they were lying on the other markers. The last time 
we were in the area was 2001 and at that time he had quit running cattle on the 
land and <br/>
had it leased out to a farmer who was growing hay. We looked at the property 
from the Natchez Trace Parkway and it was so grown up that we could not locate
<br/>
the markers. <br/>

</font><font color="#000080" size="2">The 1997 land owner, Arthur Woodis, lived in Cherokee and 
was very cooperative when I contacted him. He led us out to the cemetery and 
showed us the abstract for the property<br/>
 going back to when it was owned by an 
Indian Chief. Woodis phone number is 205/359-6865 if he still owns this 
property. Jack Munson can be contacted at, but does not claim (wife) to connect<br/>
 with this set of Harris's: &lt;JMunson@Hot.RR.com&gt; 2 Jan 2013.<br/>
