<font size="2">The six listing above without URLs are found out on Find-A-Grave and
were added there by Mr. Golson. I am uncertain of his source. As a boy I visited
this cemetery many times while hunting in this area and I can recall more
standing stones at that time. I do not doubt there were more. Some or
all of the missing ones may still be there under the brush, but fallen. The
foliage was very
dense with vines and overgrowth from the recent and excessive rainy seasons we have
been having in the last several years.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The two James A. Whitlock memorials above with the same birth date and
different death dates likely represent some kind of error, but there probably
were two children since we think there are two graves. Might be that tombstones
were set years later and the name of the James A. that died in 1874 was
forgotten as they were twins. Another possibility was that the tombstone was
wrong for one of them and there was a replacement and the family just set up
both of them. Both stones have the same parents too. These are just theories
needing further proof. I don't know what happened except there is an adult grave and a
child's grave with the same birth date, parents and name, but with different
death dates.<br>
<br>
I have chosen to spell the surname above as Stanley because modern day folks
with that surname as far as I know do so. You will&nbsp; notice some of the
tombstone inscriptions spell the name as Stanly in this cemetery. Same thing applies to the Whitlock versus Whittock
surname spelling. I chose the spelling Whitlock.<br>

History of the old Stanley-Streit Antebellum mansion on the same plot of land</a>. </b>While
much of the history is lost to us this home no doubt was inhabited by the
Stanley family who have deaths in this cemetery (as marked above) beginning in
1843 &amp; maybe earlier as we do not know what happened to Nathaniel
Stanley born about 1780. There are deaths extending into the 1880s. In this
cemetery the time line of the Whitlock family appears to follow that of the Stanley family in
occupying the Antebellum home.&nbsp;<br>
