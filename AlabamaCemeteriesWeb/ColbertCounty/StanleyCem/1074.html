</b>We are focusing on the stone in three Whitlock children memorials. They are
difficult to see, being soiled. All of them are broken off and I sat them back
on the lower half long enough to make the photographs and then put them safely
back against the bases to keep them from falling and fracturing further as I had
no epoxy to repair them.<b><br/>
