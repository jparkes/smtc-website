</b>We are focusing on the stone in three Whitlock children memorials. They are
difficult to see, being soiled. All of them are broken off except the one on the
far end away from us. I sat them back
on the lower half long enough to make the photographs and then put them safely
back against the bases to keep them from falling and fracturing further. I had
no epoxy to repair them.<b><br/>
