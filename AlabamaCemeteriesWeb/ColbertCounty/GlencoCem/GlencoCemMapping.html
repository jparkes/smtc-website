<p align="center"><b><font color="#800000" size="2">FAIRCLOTH CEMETERY, (River Road east) COLBERT COUNTY, 
ALABAMA<br/>

This Aerial map shows the GPS of
the Glenco Cemetery. ACME Mapper 2.0 as calculated by C. Wayne Austin says these coordinates 
are: N 34.70408 W 87.73565<br/>

To 
reach this cemetery from the intersection of Hwy 43 &amp; 72 go west on Hwy 72  
for 3 &amp; 3/4 miles and look for the entrance to the Rock Crusher which was at one 
time Vulcan Materials Company and I assume they still own it. Turn south or 
right into the main gate and get permission or be hauled off to jail. HA!. Go 
behind the office and the cemetery is next to the offices on the south side. 
Because of the dangers of blasting that goes on here along with heavy machinery 
all around I would say this visit is only available on certain days with 
permission and a pass including your signature on a release from liability form, 
but I have not been here. <br/>

Notice the rectangular white rock wall facing east located south of the building where 
you can visibly see stones in this cemetery.<br/>
