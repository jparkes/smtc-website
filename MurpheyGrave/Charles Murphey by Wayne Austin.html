<DIV>This is the best I can do at plotting the&nbsp;stone location. On the topo 
map the house is placed by a small black square. The clear squares are the 
barnes.</DIV>
<DIV>So I assummed it was 25 feet straight in front of the house as stated and 
placed a red&nbsp;x on the spot. Then I went to Delorme maps where the Longitude 
&amp; Latitude are given&nbsp;on my laptop and pegged the spot there and it came 
out with these Coordinates:</DIV>
<DIV>Latitude: North 35 Degrees 29.262'&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Longitude: West 87 Degrees 8.191'</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hope you understand the above&nbsp;way of reading Coordinates. There is 
more than one way to express that. The above&nbsp;is the way Delorme Maps states 
it along with TOPOZONE.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think the longitude is accurate within 5 feet and the Latitude is within 
about 20 feet +/- assumming the house is placed correctly on the Delorme Maps. 
This is from a reading of a 3-D TOPO QUAD of Delorme Maps of Topography for the 
State of Tennessee. You may want to state&nbsp;that&nbsp;source 
information.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I will send you a couple of other maps. On one you can see the dark streak 
of the shadow of the Magnolia Tree. While at first I was excited to make that 
out unfortunatley it was not useful becuse I could not verify the 
house.&nbsp;The road into the house is different&nbsp;there also&nbsp;though it 
is accurate because it is an aerial image. The Mapquest aerial image is so dense 
with trees that nothing can be made out from that one.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks again for working with me on this. You are a real jewel.</DIV>
