<div>This is the best I can do at plotting the stone location. On the topo 
map the house is placed by a small black square. The clear squares are the 
barnes.</div>
<div>So I assummed it was 25 feet straight in front of the house as stated and 
placed a red x on the spot. Then I went to Delorme maps where the Longitude 
&amp; Latitude are given on my laptop and pegged the spot there and it came 
out with these Coordinates:</div>
<div>Latitude: North 35 Degrees 29.262'  </div>
<div>Longitude: West 87 Degrees 8.191'</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope you understand the above way of reading Coordinates. There is 
more than one way to express that. The above is the way Delorme Maps states 
it along with TOPOZONE.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the longitude is accurate within 5 feet and the Latitude is within 
about 20 feet +/- assumming the house is placed correctly on the Delorme Maps. 
This is from a reading of a 3-D TOPO QUAD of Delorme Maps of Topography for the 
State of Tennessee. You may want to state that source 
information.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will send you a couple of other maps. On one you can see the dark streak 
of the shadow of the Magnolia Tree. While at first I was excited to make that 
out unfortunatley it was not useful becuse I could not verify the 
house. The road into the house is different there also though it 
is accurate because it is an aerial image. The Mapquest aerial image is so dense 
with trees that nothing can be made out from that one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again for working with me on this. You are a real jewel.</div>
