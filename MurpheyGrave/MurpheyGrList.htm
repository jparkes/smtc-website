<i><b><font size="2" color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS">Information and photo supplied by Judy Benderman Forgos on 17 Mar 2008. The
gravestone photo, used with permission, was taken by a cousin of Judy in Oct.
2006 and the tree in the background is a large Magnolia Tree. The property is
still in the Benderman family. A Benderman Family Reunion is held every year,
and for the last three years relatives have gathered for a bring-your-own lunch
at the Porter's Chapel Church and afterward are invited to visit the home place
and cave.</font><font size="2" color="#660033" face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

<i><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080">Note from Wayne
Austin, the Administrator: If you visited this Murphy/Murphey cemetery site
previous to Mar 18, 2008 you found a listing and many questions about the
location of this cemetery. Thanks to Judy Forgos and her cousin all the
questions have been nailed down. Today we find a much improved publication with
accurate map locations and a memorial photo. Thanks to Judy Benderman Forgos
&amp; her reunion cousins. Spelling was changed from &quot;Murphy&quot; to
&quot;Murphey&quot; , to reflect what is on the tombstone. </font></b></i><font color="#660033" face="Comic Sans MS" >
