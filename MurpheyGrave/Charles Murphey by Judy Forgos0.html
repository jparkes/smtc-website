<p align="center"><b>MURPHY 
(CHARLES) CEMETERY, SCOTTS MILL/(SOUTHPORT) ROAD.<font color="#000080"><br/></font></b></p><font color="#000080">
<p>In Scott's Mill 
community, on the old Benderman place. (large tombstone, near house in 1959, per 
Allie Berryman &amp; Evelyn Shackelford)<br/><br/>MURPHY, Charles, 3 Jun 1770 - 20 
Jan 1852. 81-07-17. 
</p><p>Only one tombstone was 
found to be inscribed, a few other fieldstones were found but were not inscribed 
markers.<br/>There is a lot of disagreement as to the location of this cemetery. 
The GSIS indicators point to a spot in the southeast corner of the intersection 
of the Mack Benderman and Scotts Mill Road. Clearly there is nothing there today 
but a cattle pasture so the graveyard is not visible or has either been 
destroyed or is marked wrong on the map. Others say it is further north up the 
<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/cemetery/MurphyGraveyard/MurpheyMap.html"><font size="2">Scotts Mill Road on the left</font></a><font size="2">. Still some say it 
is back down Terrapin Branch before one comes to Ebenezer Church on the right. 
Thus far I have not found anyone that can take me to this grave. Single stones 
like that are in great danger of falling and sinking below the ground unless an 
alert local person keeps track of the stone and can and is willing to point it 
out to visitors. We need to find this place and correctly map the Longitude 
&amp; Latitude so it can always be found.<br/>Above directions and listing 
condensed from "They Passed This Way" &amp; "Maury County Tennessee 
Cemeteries."<br/><br/>I wonder if this Charles Murphy is the father of the Charles 
A. Murphy buried in the CA Murphy Cemetery about 1/2 mile east of this place. WA
