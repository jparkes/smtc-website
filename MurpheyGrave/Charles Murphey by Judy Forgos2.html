<DIV>Thanks for the maps Wayne.&nbsp; No, I'm not familiar with coordinates, but 
that's okay. ha.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>The magnolia tree, if I remember correctly, was straight in front of the 
house and the gravestone is ....&nbsp;if you were facing the house it would be 
off to the left....making the house, magnolia and gravestone sort of a 
triangle.&nbsp; I've only been there once Wayne, so it's hard to remember.&nbsp; 
I guess the only way to be exact would be to stand there with a GPS.&nbsp; But 
at least you now know the general location of the gravestone.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm sure I did not send you a photo of the house, I didn't take one; nor 
did I go inside.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was and still is someone's home and since it the 
first time I had been there and met these relatives, it would have been a little 
awkward.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could be wrong, but my opinion is that this small 
house&nbsp;didn't look old enough to have been once occupied by Charles 
Murphy.&nbsp; I don't think you would want to post a currently-occupied house to 
your site anyway.&nbsp; I know I wouldn't want to see mine on there.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Glad I could help.&nbsp; It's raining cats and dogs here for the next two 
days.</DIV>
