<div>Thanks for the maps Wayne.  No, I'm not familiar with coordinates, but 
that's okay. ha.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>The magnolia tree, if I remember correctly, was straight in front of the 
house and the gravestone is .... if you were facing the house it would be 
off to the left....making the house, magnolia and gravestone sort of a 
triangle.  I've only been there once Wayne, so it's hard to remember.  
I guess the only way to be exact would be to stand there with a GPS.  But 
at least you now know the general location of the gravestone.</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm sure I did not send you a photo of the house, I didn't take one; nor 
did I go inside. It was and still is someone's home and since it the 
first time I had been there and met these relatives, it would have been a little 
awkward.  I could be wrong, but my opinion is that this small 
house didn't look old enough to have been once occupied by Charles 
Murphy.  I don't think you would want to post a currently-occupied house to 
your site anyway.  I know I wouldn't want to see mine on there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Glad I could help.  It's raining cats and dogs here for the next two 
days.</div>
