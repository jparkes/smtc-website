<DIV>I respect yours and their privacy. I usually ask because some folks are 
more than happy about that, but it certainly is an individual matter which 
I&nbsp;respect.</DIV>

<DIV>Yes&nbsp;I tried to analyze the shadows from the sun in the photo but made 
no headway&nbsp;because there was&nbsp;not enough shadows to do that. 
Obviously&nbsp;the photo was made facing the&nbsp;sun (to the east probably) but 
I really need the time of day to prove make any heady there. Most old graves are 
facing the eastern sky.</DIV>
