<i><b>Information and photo supplied by Judy Benderman Forgos on 17 Mar 2008. The
gravestone photo, used with permission, was taken by a cousin of Judy in Oct.
2006 and the tree in the background is a large Magnolia Tree. The property is
still in the Benderman family. A Benderman Family Reunion is held every year,
and for the last three years relatives have gathered for a bring-your-own lunch
at the Porter's Chapel Church and afterward are invited to visit the home place
and cave.<br/>

<i><b>Note from Wayne
Austin, the Administrator: If you visited this Murphy/Murphey cemetery site
previous to Mar 18, 2008 you found a listing and many questions about the
location of this cemetery. Thanks to Judy Forgos and her cousin all the
questions have been nailed down. Today we find a much improved publication with
accurate map locations and a memorial photo. Thanks to Judy Benderman Forgos
&amp; her reunion cousins. Spelling was changed from "Murphy" to
"Murphey" , to reflect what is on the tombstone. </b></i>
