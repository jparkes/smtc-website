</span>McCARROLL,
Agnis, 30 Jan 1799 - 11 July 1859 Aged 60 years 6 months &amp; 11 days, Wife of
Bartley McCarroll.</br>
&nbsp;Inscription: &quot;IN memory of Agnis, Wife of Bartley McCarroll. Born Jan
30th 1799. Died July 11th 1859. Aged 60 Years 6 Months &amp; 11 Days. Blessed
are the dead That die in the Lord.&quot;</br>
This stone has been recently dug up and reset high enough to be read complete by
a restorer unknown to me. The soil marks denote the depth of the previous
setting which prevented reading properly. There are folks of the same surname
interred in the Spring Hill Cemetery.<i></br>
