<p>This cemetery is still lovingly cared for today. Mr Fred Lee Hawkins said
this in 1986: &quot;The graveyard is nicely fenced and Mr. Lloyd Fitzgerald, a
grandson of the Allmonds, cares for it.&quot;. I am not currently aware of who
cares for it today in 2008.</br>

<p>HISTORICAL &amp; GENEALOGICAL NOTES:</br>
</br>
Condensed and edited from Century Review of Maury County, 1906.</p>
<p>W. T. Allmond was born, Jan., 1831, 1/2 mile north east of New Lasea. He is
the son of
Hezekiah Allmond (1769-1853) and Frances (Smith) Allmond. Hezekiah came from
Virginia during 1806,
and purchased the 300 acre homestead from Samuel Polk, father of President James K.
Polk.</br>
W. T. married Frances (1835-1896), daughter of Esq. David and Mary (Bostick)
Fogleman. Their children: Margaret, Laura, Lou, Maud, all educated at the
Columbia Athenaeum and at home. Mr.
Allmond was a Collector of Internal Revenue under President Ulysses S. Grant,
and served a term as magistrate of the old 23rd, now the 3rd, district of Maury
County.</br>
The Allmond's were members of the Flat Creek Primitive Baptist Church which was
erected on an acre of land donated in 1840 by Hezekiah Allmond. The society
disbanded after the war, and the building was remodeled for school purposes to
become Lasea School. After use of this building above for some years, it was
torn down in 1903 and a new schoolhouse was erected on a two-acre plat bought
from W. T. Sharp. J. S. Craig, Hettie Buford, and others have taught here.</br>
</br>
Portions of the Hezekiah Allmond farm are still occupied by descendents of this
pioneer as of 1986. When Interstate 65 was built, it cut through the property.
The Lasea Overpass (mile marker 47) is close to the old home site.&nbsp;</br>
-- (mostly from: Century Review of Maury Co., page 282. Some info from Maury
County Tennessee Cemeteries) --</p>
<p>Edward Franklin Lee--Son of William &amp; Elizabeth Almond Lee and born in
Maury Co., Tn. in 1828, E. F. Lee lived to the great old age of 101, dying in
1930. He was one of Maury County's last living veterans of the Civil War. He was
a Captain in Company L, 38th Tennessee Infantry of the Confederate States Army.</p>
