Frank Looney memorial, crumbling badly, the inscription is almost gone.<br/>

"FRANK LONEY" . . . . . . DIED? (18?)30" I don't see clearly the
18 in 1830 nor do I see clearly the word died. The stone is shaling badly. 
Might be "Oct 1830" but in that case I don' know if it is preceded by
born or died?  I did not see the fieldstone previous researcher Fred
Hawkins found in 1986 which contained "Age 86." That could be from a
different memorial or the fieldstone he mentions may be a footstone for this
memorial. Lots of possibilities remaining to be determined here. This needs more
analysis. If this Frank Looney was the father of David Looney whose wife was
Mary Ann Maguire, born abt 1816 then the date 1830 would more likely be a death
date. </b>
