LOONEY, (?), born 1735 in Virginia; died 1810 in Tennessee. mar. Mary Ann
McClellan in 1755 in Virginia.<br/>
<i>
This box tomb top was protruding out of the ground and is probably the top for
the dismantled "David Looney" memorial, husband of Mary Ann. It has no
inscription indicating the inscription is on the side of the box tomb as was a
common practice. <br/>
Tombstone inscription not found in 1986, nor in 2009. I saw partially buried tops and
sides that could contain the inscription but they were so many, mingled, mangled
and half buried that it was not possible to uncover &amp; sort this out in the period of time
I had. If this is David Looney's memorial and he is born in 1735, then his birth
is one of, if not, the earliest in the county.<br/>
