CEMETERY,&nbsp;COLUMBIA, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

This large base of a monument was in place. I saw parts of the top but none with the
inscription. It is likely to be buried there in the brush</b></font><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">
somewhere.</font><br>

This blurry image made before the dusk of the evening fell shows the scattered
box tombs. If this cemetery were as it used to be from this photo one could see
rows of box tombs and a couple of other types of tombs.&nbsp;<br>
Photo was taken while standing on the wall of the cemetery shooting north east.
This is as close as you can get to a credible area photo.<br>

These are the corner post of a certain type box tomb. The other parts
including that with the inscription is probably below there sunken below the
debris and soil surface.<br>

One of the piles of trash that beset this old graveyard including old glass
bottles and cans etc. It has been a cast-a-way place for rubbish in the past
though I saw no fresh dumps.<br>

This blurry photo was taken of the Cornelia Mayes memorial beside the Ellen
Leonard memorial standing tall in the right of the photo. The other parts seen are
the broken scraps of the Cornelia Mayes memorial. This my folks is the work of
vandals. I can tell by looking at the parts this damage occurred more than about
50 years ago. Most likely they were ignorant enough to believe there was treasure
in these box tombs. The only thing they found in them was empty space,
Poison Ivy, Black Widow Spiders, Snakes and other harmful things of nature ready
to pounce upon the intruder.&nbsp;The settlers had better sense than to put
valuables in a box tomb. For one thing they could not get the top up without
special equipment without damaging the tomb. Most of them had more respect for
the dead than that. Anything put in a box tomb could not be kept dry. With these
type tombs the water runs into them all the time.</b></font><b><font size="2" color="#000080">
The culprits that inflict this kind of damage mostly came from 14 to 19 year old
boys with mental disorders and sadly there are lots of them around even today.<br>

Just to show you how tombs sink into the ground and are lost what we see in the
center of the photo is the top of a box tomb. I believe it to be for part of the
tomb of the
progenitor David Looney just based on where it has fallen. While there is no inscription
on what we see the parts with the inscription are somewhere nearby just below the surface in the soil,
probably on a side of the tomb.&nbsp;</font><i><font size="2" color="#800000"><br>
