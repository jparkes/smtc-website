The long fallen gated entrance to the Maguire Cemetery with limestone columns
for gate support. A generous Saw Briar growth is present along with other thorny
bushes. No sign of the old original iron gate here.<br>

Among this pile of half buried debris is the footstone of Charles G. Williams
and the top cap of the large Williams Monument on our left, but not seen in this
photo. See Williams Family Monument.<br>

Photo was taken while standing on the wall of the cemetery shooting southwest.
This gives one the impression this is just a brush thicket. It takes close
inspection to know there are many grave memorials in there. So there are no
credible area photos because of that. All around this thicket is well manicured
lawns and buildings. It is so weird that we let this ugly mess grow up among us.</b></font><b><font size="2" color="#800000"><br>
