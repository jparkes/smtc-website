this lady is. She is only 3
years younger than the reported birthday of Martha Maguire. Previous historians
say Martha was born in 1796. After examination of the death year of Martha I am
convinced the tombstone is inscribed as 1796. It it possible her tombstone is
inscribed wrong though and this lady
is a daughter. Perhaps she was a sister-in-law? In the interest of time I shall leave this
argument to the
descending kin to sort out.<br>
