&quot;This was once a very imposing family cemetery, but has been abandoned for many
years. The encroachment of the city, visits from vandals and searches by grave
robbers have left few of the tombstones and box tombs in place. It is now a dump
for cast-off stoves, refrigerators, etc.&quot;&nbsp;[<u>Fred Lee Hawkins, 11 Dec
1986</u>]<br>
<br>
&quot;This cemetery needs more analysis than the late evening visit I was able
to make. The rock wall is buckling in places and the scattered stones from that
are co-mingling with the memorial stone fragments leaving a difficult task of
locating all the memorial fragments for re-assembly and gluing back together in the
future.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is completely overgrown, and infested with the effects of
past vandals, Poison Ivy, Briars, Locust Thorns, and discarded trash from
one-time ugly
neighbors. I saw no evidence of recent vandalism. I suppose the vandals do not
visit there anymore because of the hazards from Chiggers, Poison Ivy and thorns.
I am sure at one time there was a scenic view out the back windows of the Hope
Cinic. It
is proven that patients in a serene environment fare better, but maybe they
would not want to look at gravestones. That varies with the
individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; [<u>W
