LOONEY, (?), born 1735 in Virginia; died 1810 in Tennessee. mar. Mary Ann
McClellan in 1755 in Virginia.<br>
<i>
This box tomb top was protruding out of the ground and is probably the top for
the dismantled &quot;David Looney&quot; memorial, husband of Mary Ann. It has no
inscription indicating the inscription is on the side of the box tomb as was a
common practice.&nbsp;<br>
Tombstone inscription not found in 1986, nor in 2009. I saw partially buried tops and
sides that could contain the inscription but they were so many, mingled, mangled
and half buried that it was not possible to uncover &amp; sort this out in the period of time
I had. If this is David Looney's memorial and he is born in 1735, then his birth
is one of, if not, the earliest in the county.<br>
