<p><b><a href="PeelerlCem01.html">PEELER,
John</a>, 10 Apr 1860 -
13 Apr 1878. (Tombstone is tumbled and broken
right through the death date. Looks like born &quot;1860&quot; died
&quot;1848&quot;, if so this is an obvious inscription error.</b></p>
<p><b>There are 5 or 6 graves marked with
fieldstones. Someone has recently lovingly restored this cemetery in many
aspects. The fieldstones and other unmarked graves were all marked with a wooden
crosses and the rock wall has been restored along with a neat sign set in place.
