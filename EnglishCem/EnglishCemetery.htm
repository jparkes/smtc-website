&nbsp;<p><font size="2">&nbsp;Edward Flynn English moved his family from Camden, 
SC, to Tennessee after the Revolution. The reason for the move isn't evident 
from the cemetery, but Edward's father, Thomas H. English and his brother Joshua 
were Tories during the Revolution and fought against the American &quot;rebels&quot; in 
the South Carolina campaigns. After the war, the &quot;Americans&quot; confiscated the 
70,000 acre English property that was on the west bank of the Wateree River, 
just southwest of Camden, SC. Edward Flynn's grandparents are buried in the 
Quaker Cemetery in Camden, and I haven't ascertained where his parents (Thomas 
English and Margaret Ann Flynn) are buried. <br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
Edward Flynn English (1764-1848) was my (J. Dedman) 5th Gr-Grandfather, and I 
have been researching his ancestors who lived just about 20 miles from me over 
in Camden, SC. Edward's grandfather was Joshua English, a Quaker, who immigrated 
from Moate, Westmeath, Ireland to South Carolina. During the Revolution Joshua 
and most of the English family in Camden were Royalists and served against the 
Rebels. After the war, they lost just about everything they had which probably 
prompted Edward Flynn English to move his family to Maury County. I have read 
that Joshua English owned about 70,000 acres just west of the Wateree River 
along Spears Creek (just southwest of Camden). <br>
Edward Flynn English's parents were Thomas English (as you note) on his 
memorial, and his mother was Margaret Ann Flynn (1742 Ireland-1793 Camden, 
Kershaw, SC). His grandparents, Joshua English and Mary Holmes English, are 
buried in unmarked (Quaker tradition) graves in the Old Quaker Cemetery in 
Camden. Thomas English was living in Clarendon County, SC, when he died in 1792. 
Find A Grave shows Thomas buried in Clarendon County with cemetery unknown. I 
haven't verified that yet. <br>
The book &quot;Historic Camden&quot; which mentions the English families a number of times 
is a free download (pdf) from Google Books. <br>

<i>Mr. Fred says a rock wall
which is mostly fallen surrounds this cemetery and that the graves are all lined
up in one row. Further he states that across the ways is an old Slave Graveyard.
