<i>Don't for the life of me know why 
anyone would go to all that trouble to get to this cemetery and not photograph 
all the tombstones but from the looks of this photo it is as brushy/snaky and 
full of bugs at this time of year (summer).</i></b><b></b><p><b><a href="EnglishCemetery.html"><img <="" border="0" font="" height="54" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/EnglishCem/../ballanfantcemetery/buttontornad.jpg" width="98"/></a>
