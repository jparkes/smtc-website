(CHARLES ALBERT) CEMETERY, TERRAPIN BRANCH RD.</br>

This drawing is by Doug Baker who visited there in March 2004. He
lays out the cemetery to the best of his knowledge. He believes the field stones
are not for slave graves since the Murphey's were buried there in the late
1880s/early 1890s, many years after slavery ended. I do not have sufficient
information at this point to determine whether the graves may have been
children, but some are of the size (not a real determinant) that they may be. He
also looked up the drawing that he and his wife had made when we visited the
cemetery in 1977 and there was then a detailed sketch of the graves site showing
about 10 field stones in addition to the two markers. That is four more than
shown above. Doug Baker, 3/16/2004</p>
