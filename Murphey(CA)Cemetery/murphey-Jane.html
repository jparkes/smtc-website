R. (Robison), 8 Dec 1820 - 4 May 1883, "Jane R. , Wife of C. A. Murphey
Born Dec 8, 1820 Died May 4, 1883, O Mother dear a short farewell. That we may
meet again above. And roam where angels love to dwell, Where trees of life
bear fruits of love." This Murphey cemetery is reporting is from the
gracious nature of Claudia Jean Williams Baker who is a gg-granddaughter of
Charles Albert Murphey and Jane Robison Murphey whose memorials are shown here.
Her ancestral chart is as follows: 1. Claudia Jean Williams Baker, daughter of
2. Virginia Benderman Williams and George Claude Williams, Virgina was the
daughter of 3. Lela Ambie Walker Benderman and Otis Orel Benderman. Lela was the
daughter of 4. Alexander Franklin Walker and Mary Jane Murphey Walker. Mary Jane
was the daughter of Charles Albert and Jane Robison Murphey. It's somewhat odd
that CA and his wife were buried on the family farm when other relatives were
buried at Ebenezer during that time frame.<br/>
