<b>BOND, David, d. 23 Aug 1855. 9 days old. "Son J. H. &amp; S.E. Bond". (Stone lost 
until it was dug up 6 Jul 2012 by the restoration crew.)<br/>
Inscription: <br/>
DAVI<i>D<br/>
son of</i> <br/>
 J. H. &amp; S. E. BOND<br/>
Died Aug.<br/>
23rd, 1855<br/>
aged 9 days.<br/>
David Bond's mother is Sallie Elizabeth Bond 1837-1861 buried @ Old Hunter's. 
Father J. H. Bond probably was there also but I understand that lots of 
graves/headstones were destroyed when they mined there also for phosphate. But I 
found a connection to the Hunter's going back to 1730- from Chowan Co court 
records deposition of Isaac Hunter appraiser of estate of Richard Bond. Richard 
Bond's direct descendant John B. Bond also buried @ Old Hunter's.<br/>
