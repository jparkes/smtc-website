<b>This map shows the accurate GPS based on the Actual Imagery of Google 
mapping. Maps I have seen in other layouts if switched to Aerial view show the 
GPS too far north and west about 600 yards. National mapping has this 
incorrectly plotted as 35.53202 X 87.1467. It is incorrectly placed up next to 
the junction of Trousdale Lane.<br/>

To find this cemetery go west from Campbellsville Pike (Hwy 245) on Reese
Church Road forÂ 2 1/4 miles and look south (or left) at a grove of trees in
a cow pasture where the cemetery is located. The Grove (or clump) of Trees is about 
200 yards from the
road. With permission, you will have to go thru a locked gate and into the lane
of an old historic home on private property then across a cow pasture to get to
the grove of trees where the cemetery is located. The Red Check below
on the two maps points to the grove of trees. This image from MS streets &amp; Trips 
has been corrected for the GPS location mentioned above.<br/>

This image from MS Bing shows the cemetery in the tree thicket with a red check 
marking it. It also shows you the path I took to get to this cemetery, part of 
which is an old residential road and the rest is pasture.<br/>

I am sure the old house south west of the cemetery seen here with the green top 
is old enough to have been lived in by some of the folks in this cemetery. We 
can see the clump of trees where the cemetery is located. The western part of 
the tree area is gouged out land caused from left over damage from Phosphate 
Mining in the past. <br/>
