The above are News Clippings whereby mention is made of the Methodist Church at Hunters Chapel 
are from Jul 1872 - Dec 
1873. The most important mention is the long one dated May 23, 1873 where 
notation is made of Mr Wm. Kittrell building the Chapel about 30 years ago, 
which date the Chapel to about 1843; He died in 1865 so we know Hunter's Chapel 
existed after that or until about 1874. Another Sept 6, 1872 mentions the 
building was also being used as a school. Sept 8, 1871 a revival with 70 saved. 
Another mentions it being phased out by the younger men of the congregation in 
1875. A nearby replacement congregation called Bethel. The last one mentioned by 
WH Wilkes as Pastor at Bethel</b>.<b><br/>
<br/>
</b><b>And we have this source: 
Century Review 1805-1905 Maury Co. pg. 102, Porter's Methodist:</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Porter's 
M. E. Chapel</i>, 3 miles east of Mt. Pleasant, near Pulliam's Store, was built 
about 1870 by J. N. Porter, Montgomery Irwin, J. M. Giddens, Z. Gallespie, Jas. 
Williams, Thos. Estes T. D. and John T. Moss, at a cost of $1,000. 
Prior to this (Porters) the neighborhood congregation worshiped at 
Hunter's Chapel, a mile farther north of Porter's. W. H. Hunter, at an early 
date was a leader in erecting the chapel, which bore his name. Upon the change 
to Porters several former members (also) found Bigbyville Church more convenient, and 
withdrew.</b></p>

<p><b>I have found something for you to 
check out about a Church beside Hunter Kittrell Cemetery. Go to Century Review 
1805-1905 Maury Co. pg. 102 and last article about Porter's Methodist. Wm. H. 
Hunter and John T Moss both buried @ Hunter Kittrell</b></p>
<p><b>You are right Kathy even though we don't 
know exactly where this congregation was located we know that at least the 
location very close to HK Cemetery and may have been next to it. However, it 
should not be  confused with the Hunters Meeting House just southeast of Mt 
Pleasant, but that church (aka Old Salem Presbyterian Church) was merged into 
the Mt Pleasant Church in 1859 leaving only the graveyard.<br/>

Here's something that Tony Hunter has on Ancestry.com under Wm H. Hunter. Not 
sure where he/I found it, but might be useful. <br/>

W. H. Hunter deceased., Non-resident 
notice for his heirs published in paper and these were Dr.__Allen, Henry Hunter, 
Edwin Hunter, John Hunter, Pricilla Harlan and Mary a Harlan. William M. Irwin 
was his administrator. (Maury County Herald, 12 May 1866)<br/>
Historical Sketches of Maury County:<br/>
At present the Physicians are, Drs. Hunter, Henry and Washington Long. (Mt. 
Pleasant area) Rev. John Hunter settled one of the most productive farms in his 
neighborhood, especially the creek bottom of Sugar Fork, north of Hunter's 
Graveyard. In the early '20's Dr. S. P. Jordan, Lemuel Long, Willis Bodie 
William Hunter, Seth R. Kitrell came from North Carolina--all of whom were men 
of wealth, culture, and refinement. William Hunter owned a carding factory.<br/>

Update: Jul 27, 2015. (From research by Kathy Lynn Overstreet)<br/>
Looking At article We (Kathy &amp; Tony Hunter) agree is most important one there is 
mention of Irwin School House taught by James M Hunter. From the Centennial 
Issue of the Daily Herald of July 3rd , 1976 I found this "Hunter's- Today only 
an old cemetery marks the spot of a chapel built by Wm. Hunter South of Mt 
Pleasant. Later a school was here Irwin School House taught by James W Hunter. 
John Hunter settled here in 1810." Obviously, the south of Mt Pleasant is an 
error. Wm. H Hunter had son named Dr. Green Hunter and his daughter named Mollie 
who married an Irwin. I found his will naming her and another daughter Minnie 
who married a Scribner as heirs to Mt Pleasant property. A descendant of 
Minnie's is the one who donated "Bigbyville 1897" to Historical Society So the 
cemetery is actual site of Hunter's Chapel and later Irwin School House. </b></p>
<p><b>Update:Thu, Jul 28, 2015 
2:15 P.M. (From research by Kathy Lynn Overstreet)<br/>
William Kittrell (now deceased) told Dot King that the Hunter Church used to 
stand across the road @ the intersection of Polk Lane and Reese Church Rd. Dot 
knows a lot about the history of area Churches in Mt Pleasant.<br/>

Update Sat, Jul 30, 2015 6:57 
A.M.: (From research by Kathy Lynn Overstreet)The Irwin 
				School House is connected to Mollie P. Hunter who married Rev 
				John W. Irwin  He is on FAG buried @ Goshen I believe he is one 
				of the Irwin Bros who sold funeral business to Williams Funeral 
				Home in Mt Pleasant. I have ordered "Maury County Tn USA" by 
				Mary L Grieffs published in 1886 and contains bio of him and 
				mentions Hunter Co. </b>
