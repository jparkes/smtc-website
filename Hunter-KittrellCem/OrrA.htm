CEMETERY, REESE'S CHURCH ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
Alexander Orr married Ruth Hunter Kittrell 8/14/1845<br>
<br>
He was a cabinet maker and accumulated a lot of property was quite wealthy. 
According to Daily Herald 2/14/1900 the Orr Place in Mt Pleasant sold for 
$188,500 to Export Phospate Co--the largest deed of that time. Is this part of 
that property? Hall-Knox Mining Co. connection. The house on the property looks 
like it could be that age I remember a chimney and tin roof.</b></font></p>
