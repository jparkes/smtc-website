OVERSTREET, James, 15 Jun 1766 - 14 Aug 1846. 69-02-00. (5006)<br/>
Inscription:<br/>
IN<br/>
memory of<br/>
James Overstreet<br/>
who was born<br/>
June 15th 1766 and <br/>
departed this life<br/>
August 14th 1846<br/>
Aged 69 years<br/>
and 2 months.<br/>
Previous researchers thought this name was misspelled as "OVERTREET"
but the small missing "S" in OVERSTREET is shown elevated above the
other letters as a correction by the inscriber thus this becomes a proven
surname prominent in Maury County History. <br/>
