<i>Blessed are the dead who die n the Lord.</br>
</i>This stone must have thousands of hair line fractures. I have never seen one
as bad as this which is still intact. It could be repaired with a mix of white
concrete mortar, hydrated lime and sand smeared over the cracks to seal them
with porous strength.</br>
