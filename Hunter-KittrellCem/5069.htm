KITTRELL, Ruth, 1765 - 19 Jut 1848. &quot;Consort of Joshua Kittrell of N.C.,
who emigrated to Maury Co., Tenn., in 1826. (Box tomb.) (5069)</br>
Inscription:</br>
SACRED</br>
To</br>
the Memory of</br>
RUTH KITTRELL consort</br>
of JOSHUA KITTRELL of <u>Northcarolina</u> who Emigrated to</br>
&nbsp;Tennessee Maury County 1826</br>
who was born 1765 and</br>
departed this life</br>
July 19th 1848.</br>
</br>
Note: Ruth's stone. She is not actually buried here. I have a book, They passed 
This Way---In the back of it there is a notation that says she was buried elsewhere. 
The family wanted her stone to be in the Hunter-Kittrell Cemetery where so many 
of the family were buried because there were not many, if any, of the family 
buried in the cemetery where she was first interred. That is likely why her 
stone faces north/south instead of the traditional west/east.</br>
