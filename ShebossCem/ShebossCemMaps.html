CEMETERY, SCOTT BRANCH RD., (Western) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

</b></p><center><b>The
Sheboss Cemetery is located at the end of Scott Branch Road which terminates
into the Natchez Trace Parkway. <br/>
I looked all around there for some of them "She Bosses", but all I
found was the cemetery. Anyone who knows the story behind this old Maury County
name let us know.<br/>

Go west on Hwy 412/99 several miles and veer right or northwest onto Taylors
Store Rd. After
3/4 miles &amp;  turn left on Catheys Creek Road. Keep
that for four miles winding along many hills and sharp curves. Turn right
(north) on Scott Branch Road and travel that up a long hill to a ridge top about
2 miles and the cemetery will be on your left. "By the way neighbors if you
only have one of those old T-Model Fords you can still get there by turning the
car around and backing up the hill so the gasoline will continue to flow into
the carburetor."</b>

This cemetery is found at the end of Scott Branch Road. The roads laid out above
are misleading as I found out. Word Rd and Sheboss Ridge Road both dead end as
does Scott Branch Rd. There is no access road across or onto the Natchez Trace
Parkway to the north so it is Scott Branch Rd into there and Scott Branch Road
back out.<br/>
