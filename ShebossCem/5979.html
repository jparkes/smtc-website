Unknown, two graves marked with fieldstones and not inscribed among the
&quot;Anderson&quot; inscribed markers. In analyzing the graves we may have more
graves than markers here indicating someone left an old fieldstone after it was
replaced with an inscribed marker. Obviously that was the case with the large
marker in the center. I see the outline of four graves and five marked and
unmarked stones here.
The spots where the darker green grasses grow are most often inside the grave outlines.<i></br>
