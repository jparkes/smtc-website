WILEY, Robert S., 1785 - 1862. Robert S. Wiley first settled in Tennessee near
Kettle Mills on Duck River, then came to Blue Buck Creek, Tennessee (on the Duck
River) in 1817 and located at the Alson Shelby place, where he lived until his
death in 1862. He was born in North Carolina. He came by way of Kentucky, where
sons, Moses and Andrew were born about 1816. Robert was one of the first
settlers of this section, settling here when it was still in the Indian Country.
He assisted in the cutting away of the cane in this valley and in the clearing
of the first lands on this creek. This was but a short distance inside the
Indian Country, as the line, the Natchez Trace, ran along the ridge at the head
of the creek. Often, friendly Indians would visit the frontier settlements here.
The Wiley's were one of the first white settlers in this area prior to the
Indian Treaty of 1818. Robert S. Wiley married Esther (Easter) Hill about 1810.
She was born in North Carolina about 1789 to William and Mary Hill of North
Carolina. Robert S. and Easter Wiley are the parents of Moses, Andrew, Sarah and
John.</br>
Andrew Wiley had a stillhouse from 1861 to 1863 above Crawford's house, in a
hollow, north of the Centerville and Columbia Road, in the First District.</br>
In 1862, Robert S. Wiley was found drowned in the creek where the water was not
more than one foot deep. Robert S. and Easter Wiley are buried in the &quot;Old
Wiley Field&quot; near Sheboss Cemetery on the Maury/Hickman County lines,
without grave markers. (Ref: Gary Wiley.)</font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
