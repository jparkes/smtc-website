<b>HULL, Susan C., 11 Apr 1849 -18 Oct

<p><b>HULL, R. (Rev. Roland), d. 17 Mar 1906.
(80-03-02.)</br>
HULL, Susan C., 11 Apr 1849 -18 Oct 1886.

(29 Mar 1931). (Wife of Rev. Roland Hull; dau. Levi &amp; Minerva Jennings
King.)</br>
</b><b></br>
I (Don Rose) believe it appears that the date of birth for Susan C. (RENFRO)
HULL is that of her daughter, Susanna Caroline (HULL) RENFRO, who was born 11
Apr 1849. Her mother was born 2 Apr 1827 in Columbia. I do not have a death date
for the daughter.</b></p>
<p><b>These two 1880 census records show the two
Susan's and their respective ages. The date of death for Mother Susan is
correct.</b></p>

<p><b>Don these records as of now are from the
cemetery book published in 1988 by Fred Hawkins. The error goes back to that
time. I can't make any corrections to the above tombstone records, because I
can't say where the error is at this time. I do not have a photograph of the
tombstone to tell us the truth.&nbsp; I think the census records also raises
questions as to who the Margaret M. Hull listed also in the cemetery really is.
Margaret is labeled as the wife of R. Hull who was born in 1826, plausible, but
not likely and needs further checking. Another question is why both the Mother
was a Renfro and daughter Susan married into the surname Renfro. Based on the
census above that is suspicious also, and needs to be proven.</b><i><b></br>
