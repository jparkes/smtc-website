<b>Go east on Hwy 99 to Rip Steel Road which is the first road past Berea Church
of Christ. Turn left (north) and go 1/2 mile. When the road bends back right go
into the farm road (with locked gate, permission needed) on left leading to what was
in 1986 the Wayne Derryberry farm. The single monument is located about 500 yards
(1536 feet) or
three tenths of a mile down that road 20 yards on the left of the road.</b>

This aerial view from MapQuest is almost detailed enough to see the single stone at the
end of the yellow pointer about 20 yards from the limestone graveled private
road.<i></br>
