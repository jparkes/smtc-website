Looking toward the lone memorial as
you travel done the private road. When the road begins to climb a slightly
upward stone can be seen very Well. It is seen from here 1200 feet away far out
on the left under the yellow pointer placed on the photo as a gray speck. The
old barn in the distance with the high sides were built for storing the annual
harvest of tobacco when that crop of king in Middle Tennessee.</br>

As we draw closer we can see the stone more clearly. Some of you may think it it
overkill to detail this out in this manner. We need however to do this to find
this stone if it falls and sinks below the soil surface. It will be difficult
enough then just having to go there and probe below the soil with a sharp object
to find the stone with all this documentation.&nbsp;</br>
