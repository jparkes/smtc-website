This old house on the old Sowell farm lane is in a declining state. but we are
blessed to know where the Sowell's lived as this old relic is soon to be gone.
No doubt it was a much celebrated family home in its day and was a part of the
200 acre William P. &amp; Polly W. Sowell place. This house is actually about
2,500 square feet. It spans back behind this front view. This is the original
Sowell place we read about in Century Review of Maury County, 1906 and therefore
it was built according to &quot;Century Review of Maury County&quot; just after
the Civil War.</b></p>
