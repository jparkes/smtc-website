<i>The reflections of the rays of the sunshine caught this one perfectly
readable. <br/>
This memorial is surrounded by fallen leaves from a giant Southern Magnolia Tree
overhead which flushed the mornings rays of the southeastern sky onto the face
of this memorial. [WA 1 Nov 2008] <br/>
I suppose I have been chided a little by some for making too much of who is
buried where. This is in fairness to most of our religions that say: "They
perhaps are not here."  We study genealogy concerned with the remains
to find where they finished their lives and where ultimately they were laid to
rest whether the soul is here or not. In most cases they lived close by and that
is a study for genealogist and historians to ponder &amp; solve based on this
information.<br/>
