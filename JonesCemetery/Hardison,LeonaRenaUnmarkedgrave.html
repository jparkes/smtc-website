<div>Looks fine to me.  I'll go down there ASAP and check it out.  By the way, Nancy just sent me tonight the obit of a Leona "Rena' Hardison Collins who is buried at Jones Cem.  She was born Apr 6, 1928 and died Jan 28 2004.  She was the daughter of Ivo and Alta Brown Hardison.  She was married to Kelly Collins for 54 years who survives.  I don't know if there is a marker.  Will check when I can.</div>

<div>Another thing.  I don't want to drive you to the funny farm but aol said that e-mail with the attachment of the Bratton marker went through.  Could it possibly be in your spam or some weird place like that.  It downloaded and everything and said it went. </div>
