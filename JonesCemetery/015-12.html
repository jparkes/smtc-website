She was an immaculate housekeeper and a wonderful cook. Her grandchildren 
especially loved her sweet tea and macaroni and cheese. Rebecca had a green 
thumb and was also an excellent seamstress. She made her sons shirts when they

Fitzgerald of Tullahoma, Linda (Billy) Pigg of Murfreesboro; sister-in-law:
