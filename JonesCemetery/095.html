<b>JONES, Louise D.,
1908 - 1997 (fading Oaks &amp; Nichols Funeral Home Marker). The funeral marker
above was found with the fallen white unmarked marker which also had fallen. I
set up the funeral marker up in the area of the white marker photographed that
and then set up the white marker. On our left is another white marker (photo
above). Obviously this was put here by the same family. There are no
inscriptions on either of the white markers. On our left we can see the corner
of the Mary Satian marker<i><br/>
