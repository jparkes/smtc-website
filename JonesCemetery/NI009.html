Have you noticed the duplicate listing for Henry F. Nicholson and wife Hattie
Gentry Nicholson in both the Jones Cemetery and the Charles Hardison Cemetery.
Do you have any records that might tell me which is correct? They are both in my
family tree.</b></font>
<p><b>Yes, I have analyzed this problem to my best as listed
below:</br>

The duplicate HF &amp; Hattie Nicholson listings in Jones &amp; Charles Hardison
Cems were given me by two sources listed above. First it was listed that way
with no notations in the book Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, by Fred Hawkins
in 1987. Secondly my cousin Linda Yates who died 16 Jan 2009 transcribed the
Charles Hardison Cemetery and gave me the listings in that cemetery the way they
are listed. She told me Henry F. was most likely there in an unmarked grave,
Early on she was not sure if she just missed the marker. Later she concluded
there was no marker.</br>
</br>
I believe what happened is Henry Fulton is buried in the Charles Hardison
Cemetery in an unmarked grave but Hattie is interred in the Jones Cemetery
possibly in an unmarked grave also. However, in looking at all the above
listings maybe both Henry &amp; Hattie have a marker in Jones Cemetery.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
<p><b>The listing in Mr. Fred's book in the Jones Cemetery
appears to represent marked memorials. Henry Fulton is listed with death and
birth dates including maybe a military stone and at the time of that
transcribing Hattie with a birth date but no death date since she was still
living then. (1986).</br>
