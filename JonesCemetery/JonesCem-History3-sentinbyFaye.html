</i>For those who longed to discover
precious metal their ears probably perked up upon learning that<br/>
copper had been found at Duck Town, Tennessee in 1843. Prior to 1843 the
schools, such as there<br/>
were, were supported by revenue from 500,000 acres of land. A clamor went up to
sell the land.<br/>
Thousands of acres sold; for one cent per acre. In 1843 the state contributed 40
cents per white child<br/>
toward the cost of education. About 1/4 of the grown people could neither read
nor write. The<br/>
extent to which farmers in Tennessee had invested in slaves is revealed in a
summary of taxable<br/>
property in 1850. Land was valued at $84,000,000, slaves $55,500,000. In
politics we had the Whig<br/>
Party and a newspaper in Nashville was known as the "Nashville Whig."
In 1842 Maryville College<br/>
was founded in East Tennessee. <br/>
Disease was an ever present risk since so little was known. In 1830 Cholera
swept<br/>
into Nashville. Pulaski lost 34 in one week, total population about 1000, all
the stores were closed.<br/>
There were not enough persons in town to bury the dead nor hands to make
coffins. In 1840 there<br/>
were two classes of Negroes, Slave and Free Negro. In Tennessee there were
183,000 slaves and<br/>
5,524 free Negroes. James K. Polk served as Governor (1840) and Henry Clay made
one of the<br/>
greatest political; speeches of his career at a huge Whig convention in
Nashville. <br/>
Soldiers who served in the American Revolution were now old men. Sylvester Chunn,
who fought at Brandewine,<br/>
Germantown, and Monmouth died at Pottsville in 1840. Texas was not yet a state
but, Texans and<br/>
many Tennesseans who fought with them won their independence from Mexico in
1836. During the<br/>
time that Robert M. Nicholson was shoeing horses and repairing wagons Texans
were on the move<br/>
to join the Union. It was yet 8 more years to go before gold would be discovered
in California and<br/>
set off the stampede for riches. There was talk of building a railroad from
Franklin to Nashville<br/>
upon, which the builders proposed to run a steam powered locomotive. Just
imagine that in Robert<br/>
M. Nicholson's day there was not even a Choo Choo<br/>
