precious metal their ears probably perked up upon learning that<br>
copper had been found at Duck Town, Tennessee in 1843. Prior to 1843 the
schools, such as there<br>
were, were supported by revenue from 500,000 acres of land. A clamor went up to
sell the land.<br>
Thousands of acres sold; for one cent per acre. In 1843 the state contributed 40
cents per white child<br>
toward the cost of education. About 1/4 of the grown people could neither read
nor write. The<br>
extent to which farmers in Tennessee had invested in slaves is revealed in a
summary of taxable<br>
property in 1850. Land was valued at $84,000,000, slaves $55,500,000. In
politics we had the Whig<br>
Party and a newspaper in Nashville was known as the &quot;Nashville Whig.&quot;
In 1842 Maryville College<br>
was founded in East Tennessee.&nbsp;<br>
Disease was an ever present risk since so little was known. In 1830 Cholera
swept<br>
into Nashville. Pulaski lost 34 in one week, total population about 1000, all
the stores were closed.<br>
There were not enough persons in town to bury the dead nor hands to make
coffins. In 1840 there<br>
were two classes of Negroes, Slave and Free Negro. In Tennessee there were
183,000 slaves and<br>
5,524 free Negroes. James K. Polk served as Governor (1840) and Henry Clay made
one of the<br>
greatest political; speeches of his career at a huge Whig convention in
Nashville.&nbsp;<br>
Soldiers who served in the American Revolution were now old men. Sylvester Chunn,
who fought at Brandewine,<br>
Germantown, and Monmouth died at Pottsville in 1840. Texas was not yet a state
but, Texans and<br>
many Tennesseans who fought with them won their independence from Mexico in
1836. During the<br>
time that Robert M. Nicholson was shoeing horses and repairing wagons Texans
were on the move<br>
to join the Union. It was yet 8 more years to go before gold would be discovered
in California and<br>
set off the stampede for riches. There was talk of building a railroad from
Franklin to Nashville<br>
upon, which the builders proposed to run a steam powered locomotive. Just
imagine that in Robert<br>
M. Nicholson's day there was not even a Choo Choo<br>
