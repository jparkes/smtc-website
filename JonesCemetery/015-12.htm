Heritage Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements. A native of 
Maury County, Rebecca was born on October 26, 1924 and was the daughter of the 
late Roy Lovett and the late Mary Duvall Lovett. She was a lifelong member of 
the Church of Christ and was baptized at an early age. She was employed as a 
utility operator at Publix Shirt Corp. in Columbia for thirty years until she 
retired. Rebecca and her husband, Esker, were avid campers and were members of 
Dimple�s of the Universe Campers Association. He preceded her in death in 1995. 
She was an immaculate housekeeper and a wonderful cook. Her grandchildren 
especially loved her sweet tea and macaroni and cheese. Rebecca had a green 
thumb and was also an excellent seamstress. She made her sons shirts when they 
were young, and one would never know they weren�t bought in a store. She will be 
deeply missed by all who knew and loved her. She is survived by her sons: Doyle 
Brown of Lobelville, Darrell (Sherry) Brown of Columbia; sisters: Joanne 
Fitzgerald of Tullahoma, Linda (Billy) Pigg of Murfreesboro; sister-in-law: 
Bobbie Lovett; grandchildren: Tiffany (Jeremy) Woodard of Spring Hill, April (Kojo) 
Asante of Antioch, Jonathan (Leslie) Brown of Thompson�s Station; 
great-grandchildren: Brady Woodard, Hudson Woodard, Caroline Brown, Parker 
Brown, Griffin Asante, Lucas Asante, Oliver Asante, Victoria Asante, and Pilar 
Asante; and a host of nieces and nephews. In addition to her parents, she was 
preceded in death by her husband: Esker �Ett� Brown; sister: Carolyn Jackson; 
granddaughter: Andrea Michelle Brown; brothers: Thomas Eugene Lovett, and a baby 
boy at birth; and brothers-in-law: Roy Jackson and John Fitzgerald. Family and 
friends will serve as pallbearers<br>
