</font><b>Old Ledger book - in house torn down
in early 1960s.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><b>By THOMAS H. CHUNN,&nbsp;
Thursday, 3 May 1962. Columbia Herald</b></font></p>
<p>&quot;It was before my time&quot; say most
people when you inquire about the names appearing in Robert M. Nicholson's
Account Book found a few days ago.</font></p>
<p>Joe Huckaby sold his log constructed home
since it was in the way of the new Interstate Highway cloverleaf at the
intersection of State Highway 99, some 9 1/2 miles east of Columbia. As the
wrecking of the house proceeded the Account Book was found on the plate where
the rafters rest.</br>
It is believed Mrs. Robert M. Jones placed the book on the plate, since Robert
M. Nicholson was her father.</br>
The walls of the log portion of the house are yellow poplar chinked and daubed
with red cedar and mortar. At either end, the house featured a stone fireplace.
The floor joists were cedar logs and the bark was still intact and appeared so
well preserved as to give the appearance that the logs were only recently cut
from the woods. A mystery, however, is why the log floor joist had auger holes
some 1 1/2 inches in diameter bored in them at random. The corners were notched
with door jambs fastened with one inch pegs. The doors were constructed of black
walnut while the floors were sub-floored with ash and the finish floor of yellow
poplar. This is another puzzler to the writer since ash makes a much more
beautiful floor and should have been the finished floor rather than used as the sub floor.
Another item of interest found in the demolishing process was a U.S. Flag
featuring 36 stars.</br>
Before Mr. Bob Jones acquired the property, it belonged to, &quot;Uncle
Billy&quot; Sowell. Mrs. Etta! Locke thinks that the home was erected by
&quot;Uncle Billy&quot; some 125 to 150 years ago. Mrs. Locke is a granddaughter
of Robert M. Nicholson. In an interview with Mrs. Locke, she told the writer
many interesting stories told to her by her Grandmother Sarah. Mrs. Locke states
that her Grandfather Nicholson not only operated a blacksmith shop, but also
operated a store, gin, and grainery.</br>
The location of the business was about two miles south of Minor's No. 2 Store on
the Rock Springs Road. Mrs. Locke remembered quite vividly her Grandmother
relating her concern about her son, Charles Nicholson, the day the Battle of
Franklin was in progress. That day Charles was killed and now lays buried in the
Hardison Cemetery near Rock Springs. One time during the Civil War while Robert
M. Nicholson was away driving hogs to Mobile, Ala., the Yankees came and raided
the farm and burned the grainery.</br>
But this is not a tale of Civil War days, but of people who lived in the eastern
part of what was to become Maury County in 1807 from 1783 to and 1844 the folks
who did business with Robert M. Nicholson. The following list of his customers
features the pioneer forefathers of many Maury County people. Though many names
were difficult to read, the writer has made every effort to copy the names as
written. It is interesting to note the expressions of eagerness in the faces of
the few who have had the opportunity to thumb through the Account Book looking
for family names.</br>
Few people can relate the names of their forefathers beyond the name of their
grandfathers. Many will have to do a lot of head scratching to know if some of
the names enumerated below are truly their own great, grandfathers and in some
instances, their great-great grandfathers.</br>

Robertson could be one and the same ï¿½ certainly he could have been the son of
the original pioneer).</br>

Just what was the topic of conversation along about 1838 to 1844? It was in 1838
that the Cherokee Indians embarked on their &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; to a new
wilderness home in the west. In 1840 William Bryant of Davidson County was
issued a patent for a steel plow. Many farmers at the time refused to use an
iron plow thinking that its use would poison the soil.</br>
The Manny's Reaper and Mower put Tennessee way out front in wheat production. In
1840 Tennessee produced 4 1/2 million bushels of wheat. Corn was king with
Tennessee producing 44,986,188, bushels. About this time the Tennessee
Agricultural Society was promoting the idea of producing silk worms with the
worms to feed off of mulberry leaves. The idea met with little success' but
&quot;Lean&quot; Jimmy Jones wore a suit made of Tennessee silk. In 1839
Columbia was really excited. The 100 ft. Madison had arrived via Duck River
loaded with 150 tons of freight. The Madison was the first steam boat to
navigate the Duck River. Money in 1838 was hard to come by with a depression
having</br>
started in 1837. There was a move on to establish a State Bank while others
wanted a system of education while still others wanted to</br>
build turnpikes. The period from 1840 to 1860 was known as the golden era of the
turnpike companies.</br>
We had some counterfeiters around to. The punishment for that was than 39 lashes
on the hare back, bound in the pillory for not less than three hours, and
imprisonment for not less than 12 months. The first offense was $50, no less. A
person was also to suffer death without the benefit of a preacher.</font></p>
