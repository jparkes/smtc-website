<div>I don't have that many now that I pulled them out.  Some are duplicates as I must have gone down there more than once.  They are all from old cameras.  Anyway, here is the list.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>DAVIS John S     &amp;    Frances Sharp</div>
<div>June 15, 1914           Dec 31, 1922</div>
<div>Dec 9 1987               Still living in Columbia</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Frances is my first cousin, the daughter of Luther E Sharp and Kate Jackson and the brother of Luther E Sharp Jr.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>James Preston Davis</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Aug 18, 1966</div>
<div>Jan 1, 1987</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Preston is the grandson of Frances and John S. Davis.  He drowned in a boating accident on New Years day that year.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kenny Harmon is kin to me through the Harmon side.  I think I told you after my great-grandfather, Wm. Humphrey Hardison, died my great-grandmother, Susan Gray Nicholson Hardison married Thomas Harmon.  So Thomas would be my step-great-grandfather.  Kenny is the son of George Nicholson Harmon who is the son of Thomas and Susan Gray Nicholson Hardison Harmon.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>MAXWELL</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Joel David            Alma Harmon</div>
<div>Mar 26 1914        Jan 21, 1922</div>
<div>June 12, 1984      Still living in Columbia</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alma Virginia Harmon is the sister of Kenny Harmon</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just found out in the past couple of days a cousin of my dad's is buried at Jones.  I don't have her tombstone photo.  Her name was Hattie Bell Galbreath Nicholson.  She died in 1995.  Her husband is buried at Hardison Cemetery.  I don't know if you have a picture of her tombstone or not.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to go back down there and take more pictures.  I'd planned to go today to archives but my granddaughter is sick so I stayed home to take care of her.  There is so much I want to do and have so many things that I have to put first.  You know how it is.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have some that I'm not sure where they were taken so I'd better not mention them.  You already have Uncle Hade, Uncle Luther, L.E., and Alton Sharp.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, I have a small Easy Share camera that is digital.  That is what I used for those pictures we sent from Carolyn's.  Did they turn out okay?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Write back soon.</div>
