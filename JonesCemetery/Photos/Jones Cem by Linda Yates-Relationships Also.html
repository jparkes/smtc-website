<DIV>I don't have that many now that I pulled them out.&nbsp; Some are duplicates as I must have gone down there more than once.&nbsp; They are all from old cameras.&nbsp; Anyway, here is the list.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>DAVIS John S&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frances Sharp</DIV>
<DIV>June 15, 1914&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dec 31, 1922</DIV>
<DIV>Dec 9 1987&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still living in Columbia</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Frances is my first cousin, the daughter of Luther E Sharp and Kate Jackson and the brother of Luther E Sharp Jr.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>James Preston Davis</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Aug 18, 1966</DIV>
<DIV>Jan 1, 1987</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Preston is the grandson of Frances and John S. Davis.&nbsp; He drowned in a boating accident on New Years day that year.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Kenny Harmon is kin to me through the Harmon side.&nbsp; I think I told you after my great-grandfather, Wm. Humphrey Hardison, died my great-grandmother, Susan Gray Nicholson Hardison married Thomas Harmon.&nbsp; So Thomas would be my step-great-grandfather.&nbsp; Kenny is the son of George Nicholson Harmon who is the son of Thomas and Susan Gray Nicholson Hardison Harmon.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>MAXWELL</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Joel David&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alma Harmon</DIV>
<DIV>Mar 26 1914&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 21, 1922</DIV>
<DIV>June 12, 1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still living in Columbia</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Alma Virginia Harmon is the sister of Kenny Harmon</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I just found out in the past couple of days a cousin of my dad's is buried at Jones.&nbsp; I don't have her tombstone photo.&nbsp; Her name was Hattie Bell Galbreath Nicholson.&nbsp; She died in 1995.&nbsp; Her husband is buried at Hardison Cemetery.&nbsp; I don't know if you have a picture of her tombstone or not.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I want to go back down there and take more pictures.&nbsp; I'd planned to go today to archives but my granddaughter is sick so I stayed home to take care of her.&nbsp; There is so much I want to do and have so many things that I have to put first.&nbsp; You know how it is.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have some that I'm not sure where they were taken so I'd better not mention them.&nbsp; You already have Uncle Hade, Uncle Luther, L.E., and Alton Sharp.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>By the way, I have a small Easy Share camera that is digital.&nbsp; That is what I used for those pictures we sent from Carolyn's.&nbsp; Did they turn out okay?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Write back soon.</DIV>
