<div>Hi Wayne,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No, there is no buttom to download the photos.  There is nothing there to click on.  Please try again when you get a chance.</div>

<div>The Vick I was talking about was married to Fannie Ruth Brown, daughter of Everette Leighton Brown, Emma Austin's oldest son.  His name was Robert Baxter Vick.  He lived in Pulaski and died Jan 5 1996 at the age of   80.  They don't say who  is parents were.  He had two daughters Nancy O'Brian of Columbia and Sherry Gibson of Elkmont, AL.  He had three sisters, Gracie B. Foster of Detroit, MI, Hellen Tiller of Hohenwald, and Ruth King of Hohenwald and four grandchildren.  Do you know the name of the Pulaski newspaper?  When I go to archives again I could look in their newspaper and see if it tells more.  I love looking up stuff like that.  I could move in down at archives if they'd let me. (Ha!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, I sent in four stories for the new Maury County Book that is coming out soon.  I wrote two for myself and two for my sister Anne.  It's the one written by women of Maury County.  It should be interesting.  They said they had stacks of stories sent in.</div>

<div>Write back when you can. Thanks for resending those pictures.  Hope you are feeling better.</div>
