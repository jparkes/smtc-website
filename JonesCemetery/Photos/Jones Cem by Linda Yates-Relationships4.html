<DIV>Hi Wayne,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>No, there is no buttom to download the photos.&nbsp; There is nothing there to click on.&nbsp; Please try again when you get a chance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The Vick I was talking about was married to Fannie Ruth Brown, daughter of Everette Leighton Brown, Emma Austin's oldest son.&nbsp; His name was Robert Baxter Vick.&nbsp; He lived in Pulaski and died Jan 5 1996 at the age of&nbsp;&nbsp; 80.&nbsp; They don't say who&nbsp; is parents were.&nbsp; He had two daughters Nancy O'Brian of Columbia and Sherry Gibson of Elkmont, AL.&nbsp; He had three sisters, Gracie B. Foster of Detroit, MI, Hellen Tiller of Hohenwald, and Ruth King of Hohenwald and four grandchildren.&nbsp; Do you know the name of the Pulaski newspaper?&nbsp; When I go to archives again I could look in their newspaper and see if it tells more.&nbsp; I love looking up stuff like that.&nbsp; I could move in down at archives if they'd let me. (Ha!)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>By the way, I sent in four stories for the new Maury County Book that is coming out soon.&nbsp; I wrote two for myself and two for my sister Anne.&nbsp; It's the one written by women of Maury County.&nbsp; It should be interesting.&nbsp; They said they had stacks of stories sent in.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Write back when you can. Thanks for resending those pictures.&nbsp; Hope you are feeling better.</DIV>
