HARRISON, Eliza, born 1818. (Remainder of stone has 
been broken away and lost, F.L.H., 1986) (Stone not found, 
19 Jul 2012, by Gene Geraci)</b></p>
<p><b>At least 8 block bases are in 
place. The fallen stones that were discovered might have originally been on 
these foundations but they were found some 20 feet away. Dozens of fieldstones 
show that this was once a very large graveyard</br>
covering about half acre. The undergrowth has at least been cleared away and 
cattle keep it under control. Fred Lee Hawkins, 4 Apr 1986.</br>

</a><b><i>This cemetery was 
photographed and transcribed again by Gene Geraci 19 Jul 2012. Photos E-mailed 
here for publication to this site 20 Jul 2012.&nbsp; Originally published in
Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, by Fred Lee Hawkins, Jr. page 86. A few of 
Mr. Fred's notes were included,
</i><i>Also before 
that published on page C-25 of the book They Passed This Way in the 1964 by </i>
<i>Marise P. Lightfoot &amp; 
Evelyn B. Shackleford.</i>
<i>This book left out the Harrison &amp; Bauguss listings and mentioned the reason 
as overgrown cemetery which is understandable.</i></b><b></br>
