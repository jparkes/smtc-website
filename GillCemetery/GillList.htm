The new owners have done a beautiful job of preserving this heritage. A new
ornamental white fence has been installed which actuates the esthetic &amp;
historic value of the cemetery. Thanks to them. The cemetery fence can be seen
from the road. Please respect the current owners privacy.&nbsp;</br>
