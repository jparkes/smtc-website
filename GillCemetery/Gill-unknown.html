unknown, died 29
Mar 1833 age 11 days. Inscription: "................and departed 29th March
1833 aged 11 days." Not certain the word Departed applies as the usual
inscription is "departed this life". It could be "died
on".Â <br/>
The memorial has been fallen &amp; broken into many
pieces for several years and has not been reported by any previous researcher.
Probably recently dug from the ground. Obviously for an infant but not the issue
of Nancy Gill as she died many years earlier.)<br/>
