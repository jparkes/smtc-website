An original photo of the Gill Cemetery looking
west. Notice the lovely setting sun shining across the distant hills.<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/GillCemetery/Img_4553-1.jpg" width="642" height="481">

This scene looks over
the graveyard from the east side toward the setting sun always in the west.
There are many fieldstones here noted in the photo with the black arrows
pointing some of them out. These probably mark graves of others interred
here.&nbsp;</br>
This is a very old graveyard. As far as I know the oldest marked gravestone in
the southeast Maury County Tennessee is that of Nancy Gill.&nbsp;</br>
This graveyard is typical early Christian oriented toward the east with the
headstones at the head of the grave and the footstone at the foot of the grave
on the east side.</br>
