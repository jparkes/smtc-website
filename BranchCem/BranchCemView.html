<b>This big photo is
for your inspection of the grounds for lost memorials as I did not see one of
the stones that previous researchers listed. Looking down the row headstones are
on our left and footstone if they exist are smaller and on the right.That is one
of those old rose bushes growing out of the front of the footstone of J. W. A.
Branch who died in 1882 and knowing what I know about that hardy species of Rose
the plant may be that old. </b><i><b></br>
