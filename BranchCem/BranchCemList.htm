CEMETERY,&nbsp;(Fred white Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

</font></b><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow
Hwy 50 out and t</font>urn north (left) onto Fred white Road before it goes
under I-65. Go 2 &amp; 1/4 miles north and look right at a house sitting on an
angle to the road. The cemetery is sort of in the front yard of that house, but
40 yards further down the road. It is within 20 yards of the road &amp; you can
see the three old stones under the trees, but will probably be shielded by leaf
vegetation from the trees in the summer.&nbsp;<br>

<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>1986 Mr Fred: Two or three cavities show
other gravesites and several flat stones light have once been used as markers.<br>
2009: One can confirm the above statement somewhat with these photos. However
there is a missing stone since 1986 that of Johnie Branch. Since I did not
linger long the stone may be fallen and I did not see it. It might be in the
large skip between the JAW Branch memorials and those of James G. &amp; Sarah A.
further out on the end, (fallen) below the leaves. I do think I see a fieldstone
there in the skip center where the headstone would normally be. There also are
signs that another grave is located further out on the other side of James G.
&amp; Sarah A. Branch. Notice the balding ground out there where the soil is
mounded up a bit. No sign of a head or footstone or even a fieldstone marking a
grave out there. <br>
<br>
A couple of parenthetical statements are from the book M.C.T.C. and appear to be
originally from a study of the Census data of 1850, 60 &amp; 70. All other
information from the tombstone and this site mapping effort.</b></font></p>
