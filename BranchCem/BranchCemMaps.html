From Columbia follow Hwy 50 several miles and turn north (left) onto Fred white
Road before it goes under I-65. Go 2 &amp; 1/4 miles north and look right at a
house sitting on an angle to the road. The cemetery is sort of in the front yard
of that house, but 40 yards further down the road. It is within 20 yards of the
road &amp; you can see the three old stones under the trees, but will probably
be shielded by leaf vegetation from the trees in the summer.&nbsp;</br>
Mr Fred's instructions 1986: Located about 3/4 mile south of Howard's Bridge, on
east side of Philadelphia Church Rd., on Aubrey Smithson place. (I am not sure
when the road becomes Philadelphia Church Rd as opposed to Fred White Rd. as the
road continues on north. [WA 20 Jan 2009])</br>
