This photo by Mary Belle is interesting. It shows a large sunken place in the
southwest corner of this cemetery. Often times in a graveyard this indicates a
mass burial. Could this be a cemetery used for the mass burial of soldiers
killed from a nearby battle during the Civil War. Perhaps an infectious disease
swept thru here and masses died and all the bodies were quickly buried here to
stop the spread of the disease. Life was so tough in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;
