<span style="color: navy; font-weight:400">The
McKissick Cemetery is located out Southport Road ( sometimes called
Scott's Mill Rd.) from Campbellsville Pike or Hwy 245 toward Mt Pleasant
two miles. It is high upon a hill on the (north) right. This is a well maintained
cemetery. The locked steel gate at the road presents the average visitor a
challenge. Also
watch out for Shetland Ponies that are a bit aggressive to strangers. As I was charting the
cemetery behind the fence two or three of them came charging up to the fence
stamping their feet, and shaking their heads. I don't believe they
would actually attack, but I was not going to find out. Since the cemetery is
fenced you might be exposed to livestock as you climb the hill and safe again
after going behind the cemetery fence. Best approach is to find the surrounding farm owner and
get his blessings and help to visit here.</span></h1>
