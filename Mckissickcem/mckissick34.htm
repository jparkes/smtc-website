  <p><font size="2">Funeral services were held at two o’clock this afternoon
  for William Robert Marshall McKissick, aged 67, county surveyor, prominent
  farmer and leading Republican, who died Sunday morning at 4:35 at his home on
  Highland Avenue. His death was a matter of deep grief to a great host of
  friends all over this section, but was not unexpected, he had been critically
  ill since suffering a stroke of paralysis twelve days before. Born and raised
  in this county, Mr. McKissick had spent most of his life on his farm at
  Broadview, moving here only a year ago. A man of most pleasing personality and
  the exemplification of kindliness, he had a great number of friends in all
  works of life, and was one of the most beloved men of this county. He
  graduated from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1886 and returned
  here, teaching school in this county for 15 years and long being an earnest
  advocate of public education. County surveyor at the time of his death, he had
  served in this capacity for 25 years, and no man in the county was more
  familiar with all sections of it, most of which he had actually surveyed. Long
  active in the ranks of the Republicans, but numbering his friends by the
  hundreds among people of all political beliefs, he had served his party in
  several capacities and was chairman of the county primary board at the time of
  his death. He was married to Miss Ada Marshall Dugger, who survives him, on
  January 23, 1900. He is also survived by four sons: Charles McKissick of
  Columbia, Seth McKissick of Burritt College, Spencer, Tenn., Dr. Alton
  McKissick of Knoxville, and Russell McKissick of Columbia. His sisters, Mrs.
  J. Hunt Dugger and Mrs. E. V. Richardson of this county, and his brothers, J.
  D. McKissick of Cordell, Okla., and Elder J. T. McKissick of Marfa, Texas,
  also survive. For years a contributor of news to the Maury Democrat and also
  to the Daily Herald, he took a real interest in the lives of all his friends,
  and was ever ready to aid anyone in distress. An intensely religious man, he
  had been a member of the Church of Christ for most of his life, and was an
  elder in the church at Broadview and long active in church affairs. A large
  concourse of sorrowing friends gathered at the home this afternoon for the
  funeral services, which were conducted by Elder F. C. Sewell and Elder W. S.
  Morton. Active pallbearers were F. Maynard Murphy, Dr. W. E. Black, E. P.
  Richardson, Smith Dugger, John T. Seagraves, Marshall Dugger, John H. Dugger
  and P. E. Hickman. Burial will be in the family cemetery near Broadview, Maury
  Undertaking Co., in charge of funeral arrangements. The Columbia Herald,
  Thursday, July 28, 1932.</font></p>
