<span style="color: navy">We
are standing on the hill just below the McKisssick Cemetery after crossing the
surrounding cemetery fence.&nbsp; This cemetery is well maintained, however
there are many old tombstones that are no longer readable by any expert
means.&nbsp; </span></p>

A view down the row of older stones from the early McKissick family. The
headstones on
the left and footstones on the right. These stones were very difficult to read
but are mostly memorials for the small children of William &amp; F. O.
McKissick. </br>

</i>From the western side looking into the cemetery. The ponies were at my back
but I was safely across the fence away from them. I am sure they are OK little
horses once they are used to you, but like most animals, they do not like
strangers.</br>
