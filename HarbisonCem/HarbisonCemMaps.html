</b><b>This cemetery
is shown by the red + above along the north side of Snow Creek Road about half
way between Santa Fe &amp; Williamsport.   GPS Coordinates for the
Harbison Cemetery do not exist on, but I estimate them to be</b><b>
approximately 35.70796 degrees
north and 87.16811 degrees West.<br/>

</b><b>From Santa Fe
Pike, go southwest on Snow Creek Road for less than three miles. Cemetery is on
north side of the road on a bank between an old barn and the driveway to a
residence. This was the old Willis Woody place in 1987, but belongs to a son who
lives east down the road now.</b><br/>

<b>This aerial map above shows the cemetery
at the end of a yellow pointer, just southwest of the old barn and in front of
the home &amp; other buildings. The home is not visible from the cemetery nor is
Snow Creek Road due to surrounding hilly terrain.<i><br/>
