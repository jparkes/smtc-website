A.... B...? Fieldstone crudely fashioned into marker with fading hand inscribed
lettering. Folks for those of you new to this subject. Inscribed memorials were
rare or non-existent prior to 1815. The above </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">stone
is the typical way graves </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">were marked
for the first wave of white settlers in the south. Later when inscribed markers
became more prevalent there were still cases of burials that were carried out
without spending the small fortune it took to acquire and setup a formal
headstone. What is the evidence this is a headstone. For one it faces the east
something olden </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Christians</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
believed in. Second there is an attempt to memorialize the stone with lettering.
Third it it is pointed at the top indicating the direction of heaven. Fourth the
rock is standing up instead of lying on the ground. Well, I could go on but I
think the point is clear this is a headstone in the Craig family Cemetery in
the front section of the cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
