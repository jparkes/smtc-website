*I have new information on the Craig Cemetery. A distant cousin has identified 
the two initialed fieldstones that Fred Hawkins had listed. H.A.S is Harriet A 
Smith and A.B.S. is her mother Anna B Smith. <br>
Matilda Craig married John Lawrence Smith, Harriet�s brother. The Smith family 
lived next door to the Craig family in 1850 census. Harriet and Anna died of 
fever in August of 1849. <i>Bill Thrasher, 3 Mar 2012<br>

<p><b><font size="2">This Cemetery sometimes called now Gilliam Cemetery on Houston Cheek Road south of
Howard Bridge should be called the �CRAIG CEMETERY�. According to Bill
Thrasher who is familiar with this cemetery. The old death indexes say that the
Gilliams whose graves are marked here, at that time, were buried in the �CRAIG
CEMETERY�. A cousin of Bill's, Zana Rook Cheek, who died a few years ago, told
him that Robert R. Craig was buried there (it was his farm) and she remembers
Uncle Steve Craig went over there and built a grave shelter over Robert Craig�s
grave.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2">Through Bill's research it is pretty certain the below listed are buried
there but not under marked stones that can be found today:</font></b></p>

The Craig cemetery was becoming neglected already by the early 1900�s. Zana
Rook Cheek told Bill �Grandpa wanted to be buried outside the fence so his
grave wouldn�t grow over, the cows would keep it eaten down�. Her grandpa
was Joseph Mayhue Rook. He was son of Samuel Rook and Margaret Craig. Joseph
Rook lived on the place south of the graveyard. In fact I think the property
line ran between the 2 cemeteries. I think the Craig cemetery is just the old
part and the Rook cemetery and is actually on the Rook land which was long ago
the Freeland place. The dirt road (Houston Cheek Rd) wasn�t there in those
days. It was built 1940ish. The road used to come from the other direction and
dead end at the Craig place. Mrs. Zana Rook Cheek�s family didn�t like it
being called Gilliam-Rook and I think they put up the Rook Cemetery sign. So
Yes, it is appropriate to call the front cemetery ROOK. But the old part should
rightly be called CRAIG and not Gilliam. <i>Bill Thrasher, Culleoka Tn., 8 Apr

</o:p>According to Mrs. Zana Rook Cheek in 1995. �Milliard and Lura Andrews
Johnson didn�t have much money and Daddy let them bury their little baby in there.�
So the infant of Milliard and Lura Andrews Johnson is buried in the ROOK
cemetery portion.
Still not sure about the other infant but think it�s in the ROOK portion also.
