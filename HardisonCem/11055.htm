DERRYBERRY, A. H. (Alfred Horsley), (27 Aug) 1878 - (23 Nov) 1943, (son of 
William Alexander &amp; Frances Eugenia Hardison Derryberry). <br>
DERRYBERRY, Poca A. (Pocahontas Hardison),
(14 Mar) 1882 - (18 Mar) 1962. (Wife of A. H.; Daughter
of Ezra &amp; Mary Hardison.)<i><br>
I have recently received an email from a great granddaughter of Alfred and Poca 
Derryberry and would like to ask you to make the following change to this 
listing:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Was: Derryberry, A. H. (Alt H.) 1878 - 1943. <br>
<br>
Change to: Derryberry, A. H. (Alfred Horsley), 27 Aug 1878 - 23 Nov 1943, (son 
of William Alexander &amp; Frances Eugenia Hardison Derryberry). <br>
<br>
On the wife she states I don't know if she was actually named Pocahontas or if 
that was a nickname. On the 1910 census, Maury Co TN, she is found with Alfred 
as &quot;Pokie&quot;. She is on his WWI draft registration record as &quot;Pokahontas Angeline 
Derryberry&quot;. They are on the 1920 census as &quot;Alph S and Pauline&quot;; and then on 
the 1930 census as &quot;Alfred H. and Poca A.&quot; <br>
