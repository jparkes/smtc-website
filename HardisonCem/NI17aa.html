</o:p>From the thoughts &amp; files of Linda Yates:</br>
Sarah O. &quot;Sallie&quot; Wilson Nicholson was born ca. 1824 and died sometime
after 1902. She was the daughter of Alexander and Nancy Fussell Wilson. She
married Robert McLemore Nicholson, son of Atkins and Betsy Nicholson. We don't
know Betsy's maiden name. [Linda Sharp Yates May 06]

From the files and thoughts of Nancy Sharber after consultation with Linda Sharp
Yates:</br>
I don't have a photo of his (Robert McLemore Nicholson) marker or of our
grandmother (your greatgrandmother, Sarah Nicholson). They are side by side in
the Charles Hardison Cemetery close to the gate that goes to the old Brown home.
Parks &amp; I put them down a long time ago along with Robert McLemore
Nicholson's - The people who made his stone erred - they cut Robert N.
Nicholson. We also put down the one for Dad's 1st wife, Georgia Culley Harmon. I
don't know why we didn't get one for Robert M.'s wife Sarah. I guess because we
did well to get those down, because at the same time we also got one for Parks'
mother, Veva Miller, and his little sister, Martha, and put them in the
Mills-Black Cemetery. Robert M's was a military marker, and I think we got it
free. We also got a military marker for Humphrey Hardison and our grandmother
was between him and Thomas Harmon, but it disappeared. (Partially a<i>cademic
