DERRYBERRY, A. H. (Alfred Horsley), (27 Aug) 1878 - (23 Nov) 1943, (son of 
William Alexander &amp; Frances Eugenia Hardison Derryberry). <br/>
DERRYBERRY, Poca A. (Pocahontas Hardison),
(14 Mar) 1882 - (18 Mar) 1962. (Wife of A. H.; Daughter
of Ezra &amp; Mary Hardison.)<i><br/>
I have recently received an email from a great granddaughter of Alfred and Poca 
Derryberry and would like to ask you to make the following change to this 
listing:<br/>
<br/>
 Was: Derryberry, A. H. (Alt H.) 1878 - 1943. <br/>
<br/>
Change to: Derryberry, A. H. (Alfred Horsley), 27 Aug 1878 - 23 Nov 1943, (son 
of William Alexander &amp; Frances Eugenia Hardison Derryberry). <br/>
<br/>
On the wife she states I don't know if she was actually named Pocahontas or if 
that was a nickname. On the 1910 census, Maury Co TN, she is found with Alfred 
as "Pokie". She is on his WWI draft registration record as "Pokahontas Angeline 
Derryberry". They are on the 1920 census as "Alph S and Pauline"; and then on 
the 1930 census as "Alfred H. and Poca A." <br/>
