Have you noticed the duplicate listing for Henry F. Nicholson and wife Hattie  
Gentry Nicholson in both the Jones Cemetery and the Charles Hardison Cemetery.  
Do you have any records that might tell me which is correct? They are both in my  
family tree. 
<p>Thanks for alerting me to these errors. I have analyzed this problem to my  
best as listed below:</br>

The duplicate HF &amp; Hattie Nicholson listings in Jones &amp; Charles Hardison  
Cems were given me by two sources listed above. First it was listed that way  
with no notations in the book Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, by Fred Hawkins  
in 1987. Secondly my cousin Linda Yates who died 16 Jan 2009 transcribed the  
Charles Hardison Cemetery and gave me the listings in that cemetery the way they  
are listed. She told me Henry F. was most likely there in an unmarked grave, Early  
on she was not sure if she just missed the marker. Later she concluded there was  
no marker.</br> 
</br>
I believe what happened is Henry Fulton is buried in the Charles Hardison  
Cemetery in an unmarked grave but Hattie is interred in the Jones Cemetery  
possibly in an unmarked grave also. However, in looking at all the above  
listings maybe both Henry &amp; Hattie have a marker in Jones Cemetery. I do not  
know because the survey for the Jones Cemetery (on my part) is incomplete.  
Hopefully I can complete that cemetery sometime in the future and settle that  
issue. </p>
<p>The listing in Mr. Fred's book in the Jones Cemetery appears to represent 
marked memorials. Henry Fulton is listed with death and birth dates including 
maybe a military stone and at the time of that transcribing Hattie with a birth 
date but no death date since she was still living then. (1986).</br>
