NICHOLSON, Charles J. G., born ca. 1843 and died 30 Nov 1864 in Franklin during
the Battle of Franklin 24th TN Infantry Co. G, (Duck River Rifles). Charley was
shot seven or eight times, dying on the Federal breastworks near Gen. Strahl.
His remains were brought home a few days later by Humphrey Hardison and buried
with military honors in the family graveyard near Rock Spring by Captain Fount
Scott and an accompanying escort. The day before he was killed, he passed in
sight of his home while making the march along the Davis Ford Road, and despite
the entreaties of his family (and sweetheart) to take his furlough and stop, he
went on with the command.&nbsp;</br>
Note: Brian Sharp, of the Son's of the Confederacy, and Linda Sharp Yates
(descendants of Charles Nicholson) have acquired a Confederate States of America
grave marker for him which has been placed just this month in the Charles
Hardison Cemetery on Rock Springs Road just down the street from the church).</b><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"></br>
