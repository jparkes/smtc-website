Hattie was born Aug 29, 1912 and died Feb 23 1996.&nbsp; She was the daughter of Gentry and Isaballe Rummage Galbreath.&nbsp; She was married to Henry Fulton Nicholson who was born Aug 17 1893 and died July 6, 1970.&nbsp; He is buried in the Hardison Cemetery. I Don't know if his has a marker.&nbsp; If so, it's probably on that CD but I think I'd have remembered it if I'd seen it over there as I remember Hattie and Fulton Nicholson very well from my childhood.&nbsp; </BODY></HTML>
