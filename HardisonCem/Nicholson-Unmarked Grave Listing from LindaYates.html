Hattie was born Aug 29, 1912 and died Feb 23 1996.  She was the daughter of Gentry and Isaballe Rummage Galbreath.  She was married to Henry Fulton Nicholson who was born Aug 17 1893 and died July 6, 1970.  He is buried in the Hardison Cemetery. I Don't know if his has a marker.  If so, it's probably on that CD but I think I'd have remembered it if I'd seen it over there as I remember Hattie and Fulton Nicholson very well from my childhood.  </body></html>
