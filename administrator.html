          <h1>About the Site Administrator Cecil Wayne Austin of Huntsville Alabama</h1>
          <p>Known to comrades as Wayne he was born 1946 & raised in northern Alabama. His parents were Paul Drewy & Ruby Lee (Barlar) Austin. The Austins left the McCains and Culleoka communities of Maury County Tennessee in 1940 for Paul to pursue what would become a life long work in the Aluminum Industry in Sheffield, Alabama. Though Wayne has never lived in Maury County he thinks of himself as a son of Maury County having spent many of his best childhood moments on the farms of his grandparents there in the southern tier of the county. He was also later able to connect his ancestry to many of the old “first pioneers” of the county. Those worthy of mention are Chesley & Nancy (Baldwin) Coffee, Chesley d. 1818. James and Nancy (Mitchell) Kerr, James d. 1818, James & Mary Warden, James d. 1832, Robert Chaffin, Coleman & Elizabeth Chaffin, died in the 1840s, William Lawhorn, a soldier of the War of 1812, (wife unknown & death unknown), and Nathan & Mary (Gilbreath) Coffee from Reece’s Presbyterian Church.</p>
          <p>Wayne graduated in 1971 from the University of North Alabama. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Accounting and a minor in Economics.  He is known in the business circles for his leadership and prowess in Manufacturing Accounting using IBM PC systems and mainframes to forecast, track and report business financial results for the purpose of favorable impact to business. His career spanned 36 years and included several industries including manufactures of Space & Aircraft Wares, Chemicals, Food processing, Computer & Electronic Devices, Automotive Subcontract, Office Furniture and Home Heating Equipment.</p>
          <p>He married Linda Black in 1970 and they have two adopted children, Stephen & Kristi.</p>
          <p>Wayne is a Historian and Genealogist with a keen sense of curiosity & discovery about who and why and how of the long ago peoples.  This intriguing quest started at a young age and was recognized and encouraged by the educational community when as a 16 year old he was employed by the University of Alabama on a summer expedition to excavate & report findings on prehistoric American peoples. He has made many original discoveries of own lost ancestry. His own recent proven ancestry numbers are upward to 160, many of the works are his own uncovering resulting from of a systematic application of skill using the old existing records.</p>
          <p>This web site resulted from Wayne turning away from the raw name & date investigations of personal genealogy to a broader investigative base of knowledge of who the people were from long ago, where they lived, where they schooled their children, how they made money, how deeply religious they were, when, how and where they died and where were they buried and any other knowledge that could be gained about them that begins to give us a more concise picture of their lives.</p>
          <p>I see this massive site as a tool for broadening my continuing efforts for more learning and sharing those gifts with others. The next thought though worded by me is probably not original. It forms the very basis of my thirst for ancestral knowledge and motivation. “For we must continue to discover our past so that we can plot our futures by looking not only at the accomplishments & mistakes of ourselves, parents & grandparents, but, also, those of our long past ancestors. Oh! But, how do we do that if we only know the lives & thoughts of our parents & grandparents who are but a part, though an important one, of the wonderful heritage we are entrusted with.”</p>
