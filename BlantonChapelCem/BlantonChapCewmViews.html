CHAPEL METHODIST CHURCH CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

This is what you will see from the Oak Valley Drive in the Winter time. The
memorials are not so easily spotted but are nevertheless there. All traces of
the old church building have long since disappeared. This is now a modern
neighborhood engulfing a lost graveyard.</br>

The stones are a bit concealed in the leaves and trees. This is a like some of
those little puzzles that we used to work whereby we were instructed to find the
certain figure from a complicated scene.</br>

A large area of graves and fieldstones are out here with only two marked stones
visible from this photo looking toward the road.</br>

Here we see the Peebles memorials and in the background the iron fence of the
Sanders Memorial can be seen.</br>
