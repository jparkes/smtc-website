CHAPEL METHODIST CHURCH CEMETERY, OAK VALLEY DR., MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#008000" size="2">Go out Bear Creek Pike almost to I-65 and
turn northeast onto Blackburn Road and go about a couple of miles and turn on
Big Oak Drive. When that shortly terminates on Oak Valley Drive turn right and
go about 3 tenths of a mile and the cemetery is visible on your left in a grove
of tall forest with new housing development all around. In the summer the
memorial stones are hard to spot from the road driving by. There is no fence nor
other indication of a graveyard.

<br>
The following memorials were either missed or lost by 30 Dec 2008 when the
photographer went thru the cemetery. He did not find them: James Flack, Fay
Parks, Hardy M. Parks, M.N. Story. I am inclined to believe some of them are
there as the leaves and debris are probably concealing them. The other listings
are as noted.<br>
<br>
The stones are very sparse in this cemetery. They are scattered around with a tendency to
cluster by family as usual in an old cemetery. The graves are many though, with
several sunken cavities and fieldstones abounding. This also is indicative of a very old cemetery.<br>
<br>
I do not know the history of this church but the tombstones offer some clues
that it was a Methodist Episcopal Church South. Several members stated on their
tombstones they were members of the Meth. E. Church as you can verify above.<br>
