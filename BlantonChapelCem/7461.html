The Sanders memorial enclosed in an old historic wrought iron fence. This stone
is among the first in the early 1900s made of Granite when they had not yet
discovered how to inscribe that material deeply enough to be easily readable. It
can last thousand of years and the inscription will remain almost unreadable.
Actually a liquid chalking compound smeared over the face would bring out the
inscription. Swipe across it then with a plastic strait edge device to improve
upon that. I just did not take the time to do that.<br/>
