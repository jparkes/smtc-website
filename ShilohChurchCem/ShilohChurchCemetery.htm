<font color="#800000"><b><font size="2">The grass was tall in this cemetery and
it is possible that I missed the above stones whereby no photo was offered. We
relied on Mr. Fred Hawkins for those two listings. Two fallen box tombs without inscription
on top were still present. It is possible that the inscription is on the side
and that part is buried in the soil. Several box tomb parts were sort of piled up
and it was hard to figure out what part belonged to each boxtomb without having a lifting capability
to raise the very heavy parts up and sort them out. One <a href="base.htm"> Tombstone base</a> was found, the base
is probably a footstone for the James V. Gray tomb.&nbsp;<br>
There are also large spaces between marked graves that might have been used for burials.&nbsp;<br>
 For
the past century the back part of the cemetery has been used by the black
families of the community and approximately 80 burials have been made there. If
you have photos or listing for that cemetery you may send them in to be included
here. Be sure to include the name of the cemetery if it is different from Shiloh
Church Cemetery as I do not have any info on that cemetery.<br>
