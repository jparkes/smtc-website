Sandra Gail Ragsdale, age 60 of Columbia, passed away suddenly at her residence 
on Wednesday morning, October 2, 2013.<br>
Sandy was born October 20, 1952 in Williamson County. She was the daughter of 
Clarence Baker and Gladys McGaw Baker, and was a member of the Church of Christ. 
She had worked as a Pharmacy Technician for Discount Drugs in Franklin.<br>
Sandy is remembered by her sons as &quot;good-hearted&quot; in her willingness to help 
anybody she could. She enjoyed travelling to the mountains and loved a good 
conversation or visit with friends. Above all, though, Sandy loved her grandkids 
more than anything. Her gentle and compassionate spirit will be missed by her 
family and friends.<br>
In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by a sister: Pamela Sue 
Baker. She is survived by two sons: David (Beverly) Ragsdale of Columbia and 
Danny (Teresa) Ragsdale of Culleoka; 5 grandchildren: Mercedes Estes, Cindy Jae 
Ragsdale, Blake Estes, Kelsey Breann Ragsdale, and Larry David Ragsdale; niece: 
Chasity Jacobs; and great-nephews: Michael and Gavin Jacobs. <br>
