<p align="center"><b>BOOKER,
(MERRIT M.) CEMETERY, CULLEOKA, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Take Mooresville
Pike south to Scott Hollow Road turn right &amp; follow this road for one mile
to point where it turns sharply to the west. Turn into the lane of the house
and  farm and the cemetery is an open field in a thicket, on the old
Merritt-Ingram place. As one turns into the home place lane look to your left
about 200 yards out in the middle of the field will be the thicket where the
cemetery is located. <br/>

that neither I nor Mr Fred Hawkins found. It was for baby:<br/>

2005 by Wayne Austin on a pretty and cool late evening day. <br/>
 It almost looks like
someone bulldozed this cemetery into a small brush area. The stones are broken
into many pieces and are shaling away. They are hard to read &amp; identify
along with the fact that they are sinking below the ground and must be
unearthed  and the soil scrapped away. None of them are readable in their
entirety and few of the memorials have much of any inscription remaining. There
is also some trash thrown into this thicket as if this were a garbage dump.
Whew!</b><b><br/>
