(MERRIT M.) CEMETERY, CULLEOKA, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

This photo depicts the shrub thicket where the cemetery is located. The remains of the
Merrit Booker family lye here. The 5 memorial box tombs are all crumbling with age
and may also have been broken by vandals in the past. The stones are approaching
a state of disrepair. Soon they will be unreadable unless there is intervention
to glue the parts back together with modern stone epoxies.<br>

This old house sits at the entrance of the Scott Hollow Road. Judging by its
architecture it is at least 120 years old. By the way this place is protected by
a security firm. Bad guys beware.</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"><Br>

<font size="2"><font color="#000080">This is the sign that designates the
original home site as depicted on the
National Historic Register as the Booker - Ingram place founded in 1828. It was
founded by Merrit Booker the interred here in this cemetery and I believe
carries the name of the recent Ingram families who did the work or at least
allowed it to be registered as a
historic site. We the public must remind ourselves this is a private residence
and deserves our respect as such.<br>

</i><font color="#000080">This photo looks east from the road at the cemetery
over the crest of the hill. From here it looks as if the thicket is a part of
the distant hedge of trees, but that is deceiving because the cemetery is out in
the field. I estimated that distance as 300 yards but it may be closer to a long
400 yards from the road.&nbsp;<i><br>
