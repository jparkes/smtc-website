BOOKER, Richard A., 8
Jan 1822 - 24 Jan 1843. (21-00-16.) 'Eldest son Merritt H. &amp; Martha F.' This
  tomb is broken into many pieces.
 This is what I can read: &quot;IN memory of RICHARD A. eldest son of MERRITT H.
and MARTHA F. BOOKER. He was born January 8(not readable here?) 1822 &amp; died January 24th
1843.aged 21 years and 16 days.&quot;&nbsp;</br>
 <i>With help from the information of previous researcher's we have corrected
 transcription errors in the dates. Nines &amp; Twos were confused, and Fours
 &amp; Ones were also. Previous researcher's incorrect dates were: 8 Jan 1829 -
 9 Jan 1843. This did not add to the 21 years and 1 day. We however found the
 age to be 21 years and 16 days. So if one sees the birth as 8 Jan 1822 and
 death as 24 Jan 1843 the age calculates properly as 21 years &amp; 16
 days.&nbsp;</br>

 inscription.</i>&nbsp;</b><b><i>Photo &amp; Information by Wayne Austin 12/30/2005.</br>
