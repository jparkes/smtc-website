BOOKER, Mosby L., died
25 Jul 1846. (16-02-20.) '3rd son of Merit H. &amp; Martha F." (This tomb is broken into
many pieces and buried beneath the ground. We can confirm the name and his
parentage. Dates are from the readings of previous researchers in past years.)
Remaining inscription: "Sacred to the memory of Mosby L. Booker third son
of Merit &amp; Martha F. Booker. _ _ _Â  Departed this _ _ _ 25 ......"
(Was difficult to get the mud off of this piece to read it. It is hard for me to
believe this stone was fully readable in 1963 and again in 1988. I believe the inscription
was passed down thru the generation from prior to that somehow. The vines were
so thick I could not find any more parts of this stone.)<br/>
