An aerial view of the Booker Cemetery. The little thicket is so small it almost
does not show up in this photo.<br/>

</a>Take Mooresville Pike south to
Scott Hollow Road turn right into Scott Hollow Road. Follow this road for one
mile. When it turns it turns sharply to the west continue on in the home lane of
the house and farm and the cemetery is in an open field in a thicket, on the old
Merritt-Ingram Historic home. As one turns into the lane of the home place look
to your left about 200 yards out into the middle of the field and there will be
the thicket where the cemetery is located.<i>Â Maps are adapted from
