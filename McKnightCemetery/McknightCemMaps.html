<b>This road map shows the 
location and roads needed to get to the McKnight Cemetery. From Columbia go 
south out Hwy 
245 aka Campbellsville Pike about 8+ miles and pass on by the Southport Road on 
your right. The cemetery is opposite across from the junction where Miller Lake 
Road terminates into Campbellsville Pike on the east side of the road but 
slightly northward from a due east line.</b><b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/McKnightCemetery/McKnightCemAerial.jpg" width="1905" height="725"></br>
This aerial view shows the area heavily forested where this cemetery is found. 
As you notice the cemetery is above a large gorge probably caused by strip 
mining. That gorge may be hard to cross. My estimation is the cemetery is about 
75 yards west from the highway.<i></br>
