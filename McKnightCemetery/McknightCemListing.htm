Mr. Fred Hawkins says this on 8 Mar 1988: &quot;The above listing is taken from 
&quot;They Passed This Way&quot;. I could find no trace of this graveyard. The old McKnight house now stands abandoned beside Bethel road. 
Mr. Lilburn
Pinkleton lives nearby and said that he had formerly farmed the hillside where 
the cemetery is supposed to have been located, but never saw it. The area is 
owned by the </br>
Stauffer Chemical Co. (1978) and was heavily mined in former years. Mrs. 
Brunson, a 90-year-old neighbor, said that she also could not remember where it 
was located.</br>

On the Lord's day March 13, 2014, when I visited the (lost) Gooch cemetery, I stopped 
across from the intersection of Miller Lake Rd and Highway 245. I had to trek 
the hillside, but found an old path in the woods. As I was hoping, it lead 
to the McKnight Family Cemetery. I spotted one stone leaning against a tree and saw two more 
fallen and ready to sink into the ground. The inscriptions are very faint </br>
and I could not read any of the headstones. One footstone read K. Y. M. Here are 
the photos (above) of all stones I could find. </br>

</br>
If one were to probe the topsoil about 10 feet to the west of 
the footstone KYM the headstone might be located. but then again the stones 
leaning against the tree may be her headstone uncovered since the 1960s</p>
