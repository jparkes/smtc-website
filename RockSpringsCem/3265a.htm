</font><font color="#BB2206" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">BARKER, George,
pioneer of the Barker clan in Maury Co., Tenn., was born in Louisa Co., Va., on
25 Mar 1759.<br>
He was a son of George and Susanna Perkins Barker who moved to Caswell Co., N.
C. in 1774. The younger George<br>
married Frankey Kerr on 18 Oct 1783 and the couple moved on to Tenn. in 1815,
settling on the north side of the Duck River with their 13 children. He had
served as a private in the Revolutionary War, receiving a pension of $20.00 per
year, in Maury Co., Tn., after 1833. He donated 1/2 acre of land just south of
Rock Spring for a cemetery and this was later noted in the deed when this tract
of land was sold to Alex Rummage. On 11 Sep 1841 he died and is buried in an
unmarked grave in this graveyard. Family tradition says that the exact place is
the one now occupied by a large tree. Four of his children are also buried here
as are other descending family members.<br>
