A native of Maury County, Tennessee, she was the daughter of Billy Anderson and 
the late Joyce Swafford Anderson. She worked at Lowe's and was a member of 
Riverside United Methodist Church. If you were to sum Connie's life up in one 
word it would be &quot;love&quot;. She loved God and her family. She loved her home and 
people everywhere from all walks of life. She was truly an example of God's 
Love. Her admiration for raising goats lead her to start the Middle TN Goat 
Association. Her kind and caring ways will truly be missed by all.</br>
</br>
In addition to her father and husband, she left behind to cherish her memory 
three sons: Christopher Crumley of Santa Fe, TN, Steven Michael (Denise) Gilliam 
of Columbia, TN and Joshua Paul Gilliam also of Columbia, TN; a sister Mary 
Carolyn Anderson of Columbia, TN and three grandchildren: Cameron Gilliam, 
Abigail Gilliam and Samantha Gilliam.</br>
</br>
In addition to her mother, she was also preceded in death by a twin sister at 
birth, her aunt Mary Jo Kerr and uncle George Lynn Anderson.</br>
</br>
