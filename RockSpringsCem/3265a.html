</font>The George Barker
grave is likely in the vicinity of this monument for Alexander Barker. There are
large trees in this area of the cemetery and memorial stones that no longer can
be read because of their age.</br>

</font>BARKER, George, 25 Mar 1759 - 11 Sep
1841. <u>Served as a private in the Revolutionary War</u> (interred in the
Barker family Lots under large tree in oldest part of cemetery near other
members of this family.)</br>
BARKER, Frankey Kerr, dates unknown, (Wife of George Barker.) (Barker Lots under

</font></br>
</font>BARKER, George,
pioneer of the Barker clan in Maury Co., Tenn., was born in Louisa Co., Va., on
25 Mar 1759.</br>
He was a son of George and Susanna Perkins Barker who moved to Caswell Co., N.
C. in 1774. The younger George</br>
married Frankey Kerr on 18 Oct 1783 and the couple moved on to Tenn. in 1815,
settling on the north side of the Duck River with their 13 children. He had
served as a private in the Revolutionary War, receiving a pension of $20.00 per
year, in Maury Co., Tn., after 1833. He donated 1/2 acre of land just south of
Rock Spring for a cemetery and this was later noted in the deed when this tract
of land was sold to Alex Rummage. On 11 Sep 1841 he died and is buried in an
unmarked grave in this graveyard. Family tradition says that the exact place is
the one now occupied by a large tree. Four of his children are also buried here
as are other descending family members.</br>
