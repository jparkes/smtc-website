Located on the new TVA road, about 1/4 mile south of Rock Springs<br/>
Baptist Church on the eastern side of the road. Go our Sowell Mill Pike to
the Rock Springs Cemetery road on your right and turn there and the cemetery is
1/4 mile on the right upon a hill with entrance roads from the north and south.
It is closed after dark and anyone with less than honorable purposes will be
prosecuted. <br/>

These maps show you the cemetery layout. The aerial view actually shows the
memorials as faint splotchy spots. The road circles the cemetery from the north
end to the south end.<br/>
