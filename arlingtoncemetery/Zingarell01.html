These graves are located on the row above the other 4 Zingarells I just sent. At
the head is the Zingarell marker. On the far left at the foot is the marker with
the "M" on it. Next to it is the marker with the "MA". It
seems like to me there should be two more graves there on the right side as the
stones are not centered at the bottom of the Zingarell head stone. I wonder if
one could be for their son Harry who is supposed to be buried here. They may be
for other family members as Michal and Mary Alice had quite a few children. Just
a guess on my part.<br/>
I took the above photo to show you what I was talking about. In the foreground
of the picture on the left side is the grave of Fred M. Zingarell, next to him
is his wife, Willie. On the other side of Willie is her brother-in-law, Joe
Zingarell. Just the corner of Joe's wife, Pearl's tombstone shows on the left
side of right side of the photo. One the next row up you can see the Zingarell
marker. Centered above Fred Zingarell's photo is the footstone "M" for
his dad Michal. The stone is buried deeper than his wife's and does not show.
The one that you can see above the new grave for Willie Zingarell is marked with
"M.A." for Mary Alice Zingarell. There are no other markers on the
other side, but it appears that two more Zingarells are buried there or will be
buried there. As I said I have wondered if one might have been for the couple's
son, Harry.<br/>

Here is one of many area shots that I plan to take inside of Arlington. I would
have taken more but hate the clouds so only took this one today. This shot is
taken from about the center of Section F, near the Zingarell tombstones. The
photo shows also part of Section C where the Jackson Mausoleum is. That big
tree/bush on the left side of that Mausoleum is causing me great trouble in
transcribing and photographing several graves in that section. It is completely
covering or engulfing several tombstones.<br/>
