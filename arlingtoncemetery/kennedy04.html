<pre align="center"><b>KENNEDY, Andrew Knox Polk, son of Andrew Kennedy and Martha Susannah Reams, was born 
June 6, 1848 and died on March 27, 1934. He is buried in Arlington Cemetery. He was married to the 
former Easter Louella Henderson, daughter of Capt. Nathan Henderson and Edith "Eddy" Boshers. She was 
born in 1853 and died August 6, 1932. She is buried in Blowing Springs Cemetery. The couple did not 
get along in later years and asked to be buried in separate cemeteries. When he died in 1934, the headline 
for his obituary was "Man Dies Leaving 180 Descendants". He had 10 children and 170 grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. My mother, Mary Kennedy Gray, was born on April 2, about a week after his death and 
would have been 171. <i>Information and photo by Rick Gray, 1/8/02003</i>.
