  <pre align="center"><b>This photo is taken showing a small section in the back corner of the cemetery. This area is mixed with both 
older and more current burials. I have the area labeled as section A/K on my diagram. When I did the 
original diagram, I had forgotten that this little section connects to the back section K and to the big 
section I have labeled as Section A. Section A is part of the older section of the cemetery that used to 
be bordered all the way down by a fence. My great-great-grandfather Andrew Knox Polk Kennedy used to 
be buried right beside the fence. The fence ran from the front of the cemetery to the back, almost in 
line with the line of trees directly in front of my car in the picture. Several years ago that fence was 
torn down and the field next to it cleared so that more burial space could be added. Right near that line 
of trees in the picture are some older burials that used to be next to the fence as well. The oldest known 
burials in this section are Lillie Mai Adams and Elizabeth B. Hill in 1909, the year the cemetery was 
established. <i>Photo and Information by Rick Gray 12/09/2004, updated 2/5/2005.</i>

This photo is taken in Section J at the front of the cemetery near Highway 243. The first row of burials in 
Section J from the front are Jeff Edward Kennedy and his grandson, John Lee Kennedy. The shorter stone 
is for Jeff Kennedy and his wife, Sue, who is still living near Mt. Pleasant at this time. The large stone is 
for John, who was killed in an auto accident in 1997. Also listed on the stone with him are his parents, 
Joey and Cathy, who are caretakers for Joey's mother Sue. This section is one of the newer areas of 
the cemetery. From my survey of this section of the cemetery, it seems to have begun to be used around 
1955. The earliest known burials in this section were Elsie Shepherd, Leonard Wiltshire, Clark Vandiver and 
Lena Bassham in 1955. Photo and information by Rick Gray, 7 Feb 2005.
