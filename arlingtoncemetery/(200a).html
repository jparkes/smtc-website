you will find a death certificate for Beulah Baker Allen. Doug and I thought it 
might be helpful. <br/>
The only other conflict that I have noted is that the headstone 
transcription indicates May as a middle name, and the death cert lists Lee. 
Also, her mother's given name is listed as Minerva (which is the only name that 
my grandmother was aware of) on the death cert, but her name was Sarah Minerva 
Lowthorp. Charlotte Campeau. charlottecampeau@hotmail.com</p>

Here's Aunt Beulah's death certificate. I do not know if the child lived or not. 
I've been invited to come to Williams Funeral Home and review their old records 
including the Irvin Bros Funeral Home records which was the predecessor to 
Williams. There, I'd expect to find where Maggie is buried and maybe the four 
children not unaccounted for. Whenever I can find time, of course.  Note 
that William Baker was Beulah's father and Minerva Lothorp was her mother. Info 
provided by her husband Robert (Bob) Allen. (D. Baker)
