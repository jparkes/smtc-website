Monument To Heroes At Mt. Pleasant Is Unveiled - Mighty Cheer Goes Up From 4,000 
People <br>
<br>
In the presence of an audience of not less than 4,000 people, the beautiful 
memorial to commemorate the valor and patriotism of the heroes who wore the gray 
in the conflict between the states was unveiled here today. The exercises were 
impressive and inspiring and formed a fitting finale to the noble efforts of 
that devoted band of women, the members of Bigby Grey Chapter of the United 
Daughters of the Confederacy, by whose efforts this statue to the heroes of the 
Lost Cause was made possible. <br>
<br>
This testimonial of the devotion and reverence of the people of this section for 
that noble army of heroes who freely gave their all in defense of home and 
principle, and for the cause of constitutional liberty is a beauty and is indeed 
worthy of the cause and deeds the memory of which it was designed to perpetuate. 
The monument is surmounted by a chastely carved figure of a Confederate soldier, 
and typifies that band of heroes from which the chapter here takes its name. <br>
<br>
Senator Carmack and Judge Wilson, the two chief orators of the day, both 
delivered patriotic and truly inspiring addresses and their sentiments met the 
hearty approval of all here. They were frequently interrupted with applause. The 
address of the brilliant Carmack was indeed a gem breathing the loftiest 
sentiments of devotion to principle, full of the truth of history, and clothed 
in chaste and elegant diction and should be preserved and will no doubt live in 
the hearts and memories of all who heard it. <br>
<br>
The entire town is in holiday attire. The business houses are all decorated as 
are the residences in the business section of the town. Houses and people are 
decorated with the Confederate colors; the stars and bars are visible 
everywhere. There were probably not less than 4,000 on the streets this morning 
when the procession was formed. <br>
<br>
The train from Columbia carried a large crowd, among the distinguished visitors 
being Senator and Mrs. Edward W. Carmack, Judge S. F. Wilson, of Nashville, 
Congressman Lemuel P. Padgett, Capt. John W. Morton. The train also carried the 
Columbia uniformed company of Confederate Veterans. All, forty strong, were in 
their Confederate grey. This company marched in the parade and the alert and 
martial manner in which they bore themselves was the subject of much favorable 
comment. <br>
<br>
The parade formed at the depot, where the visitors were met by a large reception 
committee of prominent citizens headed by Dr. C. Y. Clarke, the chief marshal. 
From the station the procession slowly wended its way up Columbia avenue to 
North Main Street and thence to the square, where the monument is located. The 
parade was led by Capt. W. S. Jennings, who carried the colors of the Bigby Gray 
Chapter, and Hon. Munford Smith; then came the band, which rendered &quot;Dixie&quot;, 
&quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; and other soul-stirring sirs of the days that tried men's 
souls. After the band came the Columbia veterans, then the Mt. Pleasant 
veterans, altogether about 150 old soldiers all in uniform. <br>
<br>
The veterans all wore red badges. Following them there was the most attractive 
feature of the procession, a beautifully decorated float drawn by four faultless 
white horses, decorated in the colors of the Confederacy. There rode in this 
float thirteen beautiful young ladies of this section all in white with sashes 
of the Confederate colors, the thirteen states composing the Confederacy were 
represented. The float created great enthusiasm all along the line of the 
precession. <br>
<br>
The carriage occupied by Senator and Mrs. Carmack and Mrs. J. Tate Jenkins was 
next in the line of the parade and it was also appropriately decorated with the 
Confederate colors. Judge Wilson followed with other prominent visitors in the 
next carriage. The procession was a long and imposing one.</font></p></center>
