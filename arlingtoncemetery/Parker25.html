<b>Parker, Walter Ray, 18
Aug 1913 � 2 Nov 1918 (son of Sam &amp; Sallie Parker; shares tombstone with
his brother, Jack; I may be reading it wrong but I believe that the boys were
born the same day as there is only one date on the left side of the stone and 2
dates on the right side, indicating to me that Jack died in 1916 and Walter in
1918) Section A/K. <br/>
