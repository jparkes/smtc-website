 2000, Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, T. Sgt. U.S. Army Air Forces World War II.
Father of Benita Cook, Johnny Cook, and Charles Cook. Son of Benjamin Franklin Cook Sr., and 
Mary Little Ridge Cook. Brother to: Margaret Cook Gordon, Cornelia Cook Scott, Mary Ophelia Cook Sutton Bell, 
James T. Cook, Vivian Cook Gibson, and Helen Cook McClain. 
Ben F. Cook Jr., was a P.O.W., World War II. 
Having a son myself in Iraqi Freedom War with the 3rd Inf. Divison as an M1A1 Abrams Tank Driver, I felt especially 
emotional when I read the following letter from the : 

Congress of the United States 
House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 
Feb. 22, 1945 

Mr dear Mr. and Mrs. Cook: 

I have just learned that your son is a prisoner of war. As the father of two boys now at the fighting fronts I can well 
understand the anxiety that weighs upon your hearts. Our information is that the prisoners are treated humanely, according 
to the Articles of War. It may be well ultimately that your son has escaped the further rigors of battle. Your local Red Cross 
Chapter will assist you in communicating with you son. I trust that he will be returned to you safe and sound in the near future. 

Very Truly Yours, 
Wirt Courtney 

Mr. and Mrs. Ben Cook Mt. Pleasant, Tenneessee
