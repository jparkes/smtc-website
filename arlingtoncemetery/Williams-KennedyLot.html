<b>It is known that 2 of the sisters mentioned
below are buried in this unmarked spot in the Williams-Kennedy lot. It is only
believed that W. C. Ratliff and his wife Mary Lou are buried here. Many believe
he was buried here and then his buried here later. This can not be confirmed. He
may be buried at Hunter and her buried here with her sisters. All the plot says
is that Oliver and Nancy Kennedy Williams bought the graves and owned the deed
to them. Nancy was the sister of the 3 Kennedy girls. They are all my 2nd
Great-grandaunts.</br>
