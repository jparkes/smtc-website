  <pre align="center">These four photos are taken from each of the roads that intersect at Section E and show 4 different sides of the round 
circle labeled Section E on my diagram. This should be one of the nicest areas of the cemetery but due to some very out 
of hand shrubbery and trees that can be seen in the photos, the beauty of this area is lost. Several of the oldest 
tombstones in this cemetery can be found in this section. The Jackson Mausoleum alone has deaths dated back to 1869. 
The Jackson family home was not too far away from where Arlington Cemetery is located. With the Jackson Family 
mausoleum here, this may have been a family burial ground for the family and the cemetery later built up around them. 
I am told that the Jackson family were on the committee that helped to establish Arlington. The other explanation would 
be that they could have been one of the many bodies that were moved from Hunter Cemetery and interred here when the 
cemetery opened. The dates on tombstones in this are date as early as 1844. Those with dates ranging from 1844 to 
1900 are: Rufus C. Jackson, Annie Granberry Jackson, Blanche Jackson, Lucy Orr Jackson, Mattie Duncan Jackson, 
Robert A. F. Duncan, James Moore Grandberry, Maria A. Granberry, Helen M. Granberry, James L. Granberry, Margaret 
P. Granberry, Matilda E. Granberry, Sabra Granberry, John Stephenson Frierson, Dabney M. Goodloe, Adeline S. Goodloe, 
Rufus J. Goodloe, Cordelia Helen Goodloe, F. S. Goodloe, Henry H. Sowell, Ingram Cecil Sowell, Joseph Goodloe Sowell, 
Myra Sowell, Ida May Goodloe, Mollie E. Goodloe, Virginia B. Goodloe, Willie S. Goodloe, and John William English. 
The first burial after the cemetery was established was Nannie Maria Jackson, daughter of Rufus &amp; Annie Granberry 
Jackson, in the Jackson Family Mausoleum in 1909.<i><b> </b>Photo by Rick Gray 3/01/2005</i>.
