 of the Sandy Hook Church of Christ. She is survived by a daughter, Katie (Chuck) Thornton of 
Columbia; a stepdaughter, Peggy (Jeff) Odom of Mt. Pleasant; a stepson, Berry (Mary) Vandygriff 
of Garden City, Mich.; three stepgranddaughters and one step great granddaughter; a special niece,

Kennedy and Jeff &quot;Mutt&quot; Kennedy. Pallbearers will be Austin Huddleston, Milton Hay, Donnie
