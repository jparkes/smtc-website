<b>Arlington Cemetery became the main burial grounds
for Mt. Pleasant after the historic Hunter Cemetery became full and burials
ceased there. Arlington was established in 1909, but there are several burials
in the cemetery dated before that. I am not sure if these were bodies that were
moved here from another location or were already here and the cemetery built up
around them. So far I have not found anyone who knows this information. Many of
these burials are for members of the Jackson and Granberry families which date
in the 1860�s and 1870�s. County historians have listed the first burial
here as the infant daughter of George &amp; Florence Allred on 12 Apr 1909. The
cemetery is located off of Highway 243, just south of Mt. Pleasant. The cemetery
remained the main burial ground for Mt. Pleasant for many years, and is still
widely used today, but the principal cemetery for Mt. Pleasant citizens in the
last few years has been Polk Memorial Gardens, located to the north of Mt.
Pleasant off of Highway 243.</b></font></p>
