  <pre align="center"><b>These shots are taken in the upper corner of Section F just at the junction where the road takes you around to section
 E, C, or G. In this corner are for the most part the graves of the Allen and Stewart families. Section F is one of the 
sections where you will find tombstones with dates of death listed before the cemetery was established in 1909. It leads 
me to the conclusion that this area was used as a burying ground before it was made official, unless the bodies were 
interred elsewhere and moved here after 1909. There are just too many stones with death dates before 1909 to not believe 
this. In Section E you will find some stones with deaths dating back to before 1870. In Section F, you will find the earliest 
death date listed as John W. Pennington in 1898. Also listed are Raymond L. Pennington in 1901, Burnie E. Pennington in 
1906, and Annie Myrtle Renfro in 1907. After these the next burial in this section was that of James E. Roddy in 1909, 
the year the cemetery was established. As stated on the front page here, county historians have listed the first burial 
here as that of an infant daughter of George and Florence Allred on 12 Apr 1909. <i>Photo &amp; info by Rick Gray 2/25/2005</i>.
