</span></i>The Military stone of James Morton Hamilton, Tenn, Pvt. US Army WWI,
Dec 21, 1892 - Mar 22, 1969.<br>
&nbsp;Mr. Hamilton owned Hamilton Drug Store on the corner of Bluegrass and Main
St., in the downtown business running east of the Monument in the southerly
direction area of Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee. In my (Mary Bob) memories of the
1950's and 1960's Hamilton Drug Store was the hang-out for all the kids after
school. Mr. Hamilton was a very prominent citizen of that hamlet. The location
of the drug store in itself has much historical value. In the early 1900's the
building was &quot;The R. R. Williams Drug Store. the sign that was painted on
the side of the building still remains to this date (2004), advertising
medicine, chemicals and soda water. Items of great demand for the time. R.R.
Williams (former Confederate soldier and later mayor of Mt. Pleasant). The
second floor of the building were the offices of Lawyer W. M. Hardin and the
General Sessions Court.<i><br>
