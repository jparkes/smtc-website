Ernest, 26 Apr 1874 - 24 Jun 1958. (died in Mt Pleasant; native of Maury Co.;
married to Anna Bell Odom who preceded him in death; son of Anderson &amp;
Mollie Duke Gibson; Farmer in the Mt Pleasant area.)<br/>
GIBSON, Anna Bell Odom, 17 Feb 1877 - 26 Jan 1930. Husband of Ernest Gibson,
1874-1958; daughter of Willis &amp; Martha Perkins Odom; interred here in an
unidentified grave.<br/>
<br/>
These (above) are my (Charlotte Colvett) great grandparents who are buried here
at Arlington Cemetery in Mt. Pleasant.<br/>
Using Rick Gray's map of Arlington Cemetery Ernest Gibson is buried in section
K. Some family members had a memorial stone put in for Ernest in recent years.
Ernest is not listed in the Mr. Fred Hawkin's cemetery book or (this) Rick's
list. Anna Bell Odom, also known only as Annie Gibson died in 1930, and was
buried at Arlington, in an unmarked grave. The exact location is unknown at this
time. I am sending along documents and also a picture of the stone for Ernest.<br/>
