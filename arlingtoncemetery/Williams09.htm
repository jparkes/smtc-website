</b><i>Note:The breakage to the upper left corner of this stone is probably
caused by lawnmower damage. Eventually the folks that are committing these
careless acts had better be prepared to reach into their pocketbooks and find the
thousands of dollars in damages they are causing. Sooner or later lawyers will get wind of the proceeds that they
can gain here. Just absolutely
destroys the beauty of the stone even if the inscription is not harmed.
