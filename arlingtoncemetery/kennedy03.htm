<pre align="center"><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>KENNEDY,William Andrew Tomas, born May 1873 in Maury County, Tennessee and died July 1, 1905 in 
King's Daughters Hospital. Buried at Arlington Cemetery. He was the son of Andrew Knox Kennedy and Easter 
Louella Henderson. On July 1, 1905 he married Lola Winifred Edith Ray Rich (buried here with him). 
She was born in 1886 in Summertown, Tennessee and died 1953 in Nashville, Tennessee. This is not 
the original stone for them. The other stone became hard to read. Shortly before his death, their son, 
Thomas, purchased this new stone for them. All of their children but 2 are buried at Arlington. A 
daughter, Bertie, is buried at Blowing Springs and a son is buried at the Sheepneck Cemetery. Of the 
other children all are buried in the right corner of Arlington except a daughter, Edith.
