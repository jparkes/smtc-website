<strong>
Note from H. Braden who is trying to locate her grave site:</strong> Josephine 
V. Holt. Headstone is small flat horizontal. Located below 3 other Holt 
headstones of similar size and shape. Facing the cemetery, the headstone is 
along the right fence line about halfway down the cemetery. For a long time the 
burial spot was lost due to no marker. Williams funeral home had to find the 
spot and mark it before a headstone could be laid. I still remember the 
complaint that she was buried next to a tree stump. (stump unless of cedar would 
be rotted today but may have left unlevel ground as a way of proving this[WA 1 
Dec 2010.)</font><b></br>
