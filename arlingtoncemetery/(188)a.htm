<b>Bell, Harold Leon, 13 Jan 
1915 - 1 Jun 1916 (son of James Minor &quot;Jim&quot; Bell and Monetta Evans) Note: Death 
notice states that he was born 15 Jan 1916 and died 1 Jun 1916).</br>
</font>Note by Rick Gray regarding changing 
the death year to 1916 from 1918: I believe the old transcription by Fred 
Hawkins was mistaken. His death certificate states he died in 1916 and not 1918. 
I canï¿½t even make out that part on the stone, but as you know many times a 6 and 
8 can look a like on an old stone.</font></br>
