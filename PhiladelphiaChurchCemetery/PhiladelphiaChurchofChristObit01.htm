1963. (Fallen Officer)<br>
Constable Grady Dillehay was shot and killed as he and two state troopers 
attempted to arrest an escapee from the county workhouse. The man had escaped 
while working on a chain gang.<br>
<br>
The troopers and Constable Dillehay went to the man's home shortly after 
midnight and yelled out to him to surrender. When he asked if they had a 
warrant, Constable Dillehay responded that they did. The man then fired a 
20-gauge shotgun out the window, striking Constable Dillehay in the face.<br>
<br>
Constable Dillehay was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced 
dead. The suspect surrendered to officers about 30 minutes after the shooting.<br>
<br>
The suspect was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to 99 years in 
prison. He was eventually paroled and died in 2006.<br>
<br>
Constable Dillehay had been elected constable in 1960 and had previously served 
as a deputy with the Maury County Sheriff's Office. He is survived by his wife, 
two step-children, brother, sister, half-brother, and mother.<br>
