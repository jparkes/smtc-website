This is a photo of the Philadelphia Church of Christ. It was not named after
the City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but after the Philadelphia Church in the
New Testament section of the Bible. Behind the building is our subject
cemetery.</br>
<i>Visit here for worship, memories and reverence and you are a welcome soul. Go
there with mischievous aims and you will be figuratively strung up to the
nearest tree by the folks who keep close watch here.</br>
