CHURCH OF CHRIST CEMETERY, FRED WHITE RD., MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

This photo shows the sign which does not show up so well against the background
of the lighted sky. From here we can glance across the gated fence at the
memorials of the cemetery. This is looking northwest. More of the cemetery spans
on both sides of this view with the rows spanning north/south. This cemetery is
one of the best cared for in Maury County by the loving hands of friends &amp;
relatives.<br/>

Looking southwest from the northeast corner of the cemetery. Most of the graves
are on the right of this view.<br/>

Panning right captures more of the cemetery but still more lies to our right.<br/>

Panning further to the right yields this image of a well cared for cemetery.<br/>
<i>Visit here for worship, memories and reverence and you are a welcome soul.
Come here with mischievous aims and you will be figuratively strung up to the
nearest tree by the folks who keep close watch here.<br/>
