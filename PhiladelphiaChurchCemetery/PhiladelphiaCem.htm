<br>
This church, located on the road between Howard's Bridge and Lewisburg Pike, is
one of the older churches of Maury County. Earlier Churches of Christ went by
the name Christian Church in earlier times as this one was. It was organized in
the years following the Civil War, meeting in those early years in the Lick
Skillet School building. By 1874, however, it was deemed necessary to build a
more commodious and appropriate church house. H.O. Gilliam was the person who
supplied much of the funds and labor used in the building. The members of his
family were leading participates of the church for several generations. Other
families who were active in those early were: Andrews, Davidson, Cheek and
Sewell and others shown in the grave listing not noted here. Early ministers
included: Elder James Morton, W. I. Morton and Elder Sewell.<br>
