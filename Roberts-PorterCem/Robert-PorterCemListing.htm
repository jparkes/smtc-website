** These stones are missing the inscribed tops or are completely missing the 
stones.</br>
</br>
Two or more fieldstones, at least 2 heavy lime rock bases and one fallen rock crypt 
mark places where other graves are located. These must be the</br>
bases for the Roberts tombstones. But where are the monuments? It is a mystery that 
needs to be solved. The small area is enclosed in a low wire fence,</br>
which is presently being used as a dog run.</br>
This cemetery holds a lot of history and it would be a pity to see the rest of 
it destroyed by thoughtless people in the future.</br>

NOTES:</br>
&quot;Gen. Isaac Roberts, the 1st chairman of Maury Co. Court, served in the 
Revolution and again in 1812. He was promoted to Brigadier General of reserves 
in 1814. He died</br>
in 1816, and is buried 3 miles N. E. of Columbia, where a fitting monument 
should be erected,&quot; Robbins, D. P., Century Review of Maury County, p. 163.</br>
