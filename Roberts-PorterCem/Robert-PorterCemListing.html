<br/>
** These stones are missing the inscribed tops or are completely missing the 
stones.<br/>
<br/>
Two or more fieldstones, at least 2 heavy lime rock bases and one fallen rock crypt 
mark places where other graves are located. These must be the<br/>
bases for the Roberts tombstones. But where are the monuments? It is a mystery that 
needs to be solved. The small area is enclosed in a low wire fence,<br/>
which is presently being used as a dog run.<br/>
This cemetery holds a lot of history and it would be a pity to see the rest of 
it destroyed by thoughtless people in the future.<br/>
<br/>
NOTES:<br/>
"Gen. Isaac Roberts, the 1st chairman of Maury Co. Court, served in the 
Revolution and again in 1812. He was promoted to Brigadier General of reserves 
in 1814. He died<br/>
in 1816, and is buried 3 miles N. E. of Columbia, where a fitting monument 
should be erected," Robbins, D. P., Century Review of Maury County, p. 163.<br/>
<br/>
"Roberts was a Revolutionary soldier and brigadier general in the War of 1812. 
He is considered the father of Maury County. He was the first chairman of the 
Maury County<br/>
Court, first postmaster of Columbia, head of the local militia and was a state 
representative. He was buried in 1816." (King, Danice Dowell, reporting in The Daily 
Herald, 21 May
