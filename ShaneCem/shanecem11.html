looking at some labeled stones in the far western section. This is the older section of the
cemetery One can pick a stone and go to the individual section and view it up
close, in many cases well enough to read the inscription.

looking south from the northwest older section of the cemetery.  The Box Tomb of Martha Carothers is
in the center to the left of the
Maple Tree. The stone have been labeled for location and to show family
relationships. Stones not labeled are the ones I am not aware of the person
interred there, however the stones are shown individually on this site. Far
distant ones are not labeled also. Hopefully this labeling procedure will aid
any restoration efforts needed in the future. June
