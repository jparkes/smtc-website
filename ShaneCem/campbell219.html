		Hi, Wayne.  Today I was 
		revisiting the Shane Cemetery in Maury County, Tennessee----online of 
		course.</div>
	<div>
		I realized an error I had in my 
		information:</div>
	<div>
		<strong>CAMPBELL, 
		Sarah Ann, 27 Jan 1825 - 12 Oct 
		1866. (Consort of James H. Campbell; dau. J.S. &amp; F.M. Hunt.)
		</strong></div>
	<div>
		The Campbell Family Bible says <b>
		Sarah Ann Campbell died 1863</b>.  This is important since her 
		widower <b>remarried in March 1866.</b> </div>
	<div>
		Thanks for all your tromping around 
		overgrown cemeteries getting the great shots.</div>
	<div>
		Sincerely,</div>
	<div>

	My best shot at transcribing this tombstone:<br/>
 <i>Here lies the body of Sarah<br/>
 Ann, Consort of James H. Campbell.<br/>
	and Daughter of J. . . . .M. <br/>
	Hunt born January . . 7th 1. . .<br/>
	Died Oct 12th 186(3? or perhaps 5)<br/>
	(epitah). . . triumphant in faith.  </i></p></div>

	Hi Beverly. Good to hear of you. </div>

			My position of course is that the tombstone inscriptions are listed 
			on this site. However, when the tombstone is proven wrong. I will 
			post the exception note showing that. 
			<div style="FONT-FAMILY: arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">
				
				I have found the original photo and manipulated it some (shown 
				above) for readability sake. Luckily the year date of death is 
				at least mostly verifiable. I can make out 186 and see that the 
				last number is not a 6 and I see a period in that last digit as 
				if it is in the beginning of a 3. This is enough to make me 
				reverse my position and state it is 1863 since all other records 
				verify that. I will qualify previous historians saying the 
				inscription is 1866 along with showing your proof of error.

			When I did the Shane Cemetery I was new and had little knowledge of 
			how to prove out the inscription using photography. So in this case 
			I have no large format photo which verifies what the inscription 
			says.</div>
