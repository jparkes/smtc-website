(Stone broken.) Believe the stone clearly says 1870. MCTC shows the date as 1907. 
Evidence indicating 1870 is correct is the her age. If she had lived to a ripe old age of 74 she would 
have not been the only Cheatham interred in this cemetery as often happened to a wife who died prematurely 
young. She would probably have been buried with her husband. Revised 10/22/03 WA.</b></font></pre>
