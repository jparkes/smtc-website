<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#800000"><b>   All of the above inscriptions were on the same large White Family Memorial shown here 
as the Thomas White Family.
Thomas C. [probably Campbell] White born Nov 22, 1827 Waco, Giles Co TN, d June 13, 1851 
Fountain Creek, TN, married Feb 4, 1851 Campbell's Station, Giles Co TN to Carolyn Amy Campbell born 
Campbell's Station, Giles Co TN. Thomas C. was son of Elisha White Sr. and Catherine 'Jane' Walker. 
Children of Elisha &amp; Catherine known to me; 1. Mary Florence md Sam Kincaid 2. Martha md John H. Kirk.
This family accompanied by the two brothers, Thomas and John Coleman Walker, moved to Giles Co TN in 1809, 
where Elisha purchased 100 acres on Lynn Creek. He later purchased more later and was a wealthy man. 
He gave the land that became known as Lynnville. Page 109, Giles Co Chancery Court, Woodruff Papers 
Files T-Z, 1830-1900 by Elizabeth Whitt White. TN Bible and Family Records, A TN Bicentennial 
project, 1996, pp 370, 371, includes the blacks owned by this family, 27 in all. This book states all 19 
children were born to Jane Walker. She had 13 sons and 6 daughters. This material was copied and 
edited due to duplication and stray papers contained in the box Howard and Mary White brought from 
his father's [Bruce-White] estate in Lewisburg, Marshall Co TN, but some part of the pages were 
damaged, then recopied. Most of these people were from Middle TN- Giles, Marshall and Maury Counties. 
Campbell White Pennington, retired professor, living in Austin, TX is writing a book about his family 
lines above. Thomas White and Caroline Campbell were his grandparents. Ann Campbell of Cleveland, 
TN shared her information of above families with Campbell Pennington. She is very into genealogy. 
Elisha White's grandparents were John White Jr. and Frances Terry. John White Jr was son of 
John White Sr. and Penelope. Maybe some help to  researchers of these lines, Ginny Keefer 12/28/2004</b></font></pre>
