<center>JACKSON, Mark, no dates remaining (b. 12 
	Nov 1742; d. 1839), Soldier of the Revolutionary War. </font>
	(stone no longer readable as of 2010 
	C.W.A.)</br>
	</font></br>
	</font>Inscription:&quot;<i>SACRED to the memory of Mark Jackson, A Soldier of the REVOLUTION, 
  </i></font><i>who departed 
	this life, (1839 ) it is believed....&quot;</i>)</font></br>
	The Stone is fallen
  and sadly in need of repair or replacement. If this stone is not soon remounted upright the lawn mowers 
  will destroy it. Notice the large light gouges in the lower right corner). If you are in this cemetery put a small American Flag next to the stone to alert the grounds keepers of its location because they 
are having trouble seeing it. (CWA 15 Jun 2002)</br>
	</br>
	</font>Update a recent visit to this cemetery found this stone destroyed by the lawn mowers just as I predicted. Better preserve this photo because 
	once it is gone there is nothing remaining of this stone. It is still there just 
	very little inscription is visible today because the lawn mowers have ran over the stone  until now it is destroyed.

	<i>This stone was photographed in 2002 and graphics added&nbsp;later to 
	show the fading inscription which is today (2011) gone. C. Wayne Austin</i></font><center>
