looking west from the northern older section of the cemetery. Out beyond the
above stone of Patience Wells and to the right of the tree notice the scattered stones.
These are primarily for many
children in the neighborhood who died in infancy or youth in the mid 1800s. The
death of children was so prevalent in those days that in this case they reserved a section of
the cemetery for them. On
the left is the large Maple tree which is decaying and has large limbs that are
falling away. The Box Tomb of Martha Carothers is on your left in front of the
Maple Tree. Martha was one of the first persons to receive a grave marker in the
1830s, but not the first burial in the cemetery. That would have been an
unmarked grave. June
