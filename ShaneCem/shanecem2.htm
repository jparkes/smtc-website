View of the cemetery looking southwest from the west side of the Cemetery. The
flat
white object in the grass in the lower left corner is the fallen stone of William Kerr, born
ca 1781, died 1853. His stone was readable in 1990 when this photo was taken, but
has since broken up into many layers and is totally unreadable. Efforts are being
made to restore the stone while the inscription is still known to this generation. This view is of the oldest section of the cemetery. Notice the unique
shapes of the stones. Many of them are composed of low grade limestone and other
natural stone with various hardness levels. Unlike today's granite they are fast
returning to dust.  The intent of this site is to capture as much of the
imagery as possible while many of the above are still readable. I did not clean
them except just enough to be able to photograph the inscription. It is my
opinion the lichen, algae and other plant growth on the face of the stone
protects the surface of the stone from hail and other harsh elements prolonging
its life. Some of the family memorials shown here are; the Martins; the Wardens;
the Kerrs, the Campbells, the Harrises, the Taylors, the Davis, and many others. Notice just
to the right of the tall stone of Permelia Kerr is a pointed field stone marking a
grave. Probably an early Kerr family marker. However, some graves have no markers at all.&nbsp;</font></b>
