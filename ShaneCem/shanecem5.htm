looking east to north thru the older northwestern section.&nbsp; On your
left side and white in color are the Veteran memorials of two old Revolutionary War soldiers James
Allen and Aaron Reynolds. Lying on the ground between them and you is another old
revolutionary soldiers's memorial by the name of Mark Jackson. Except for Mark, Just to the left
center is the tall stone of John N. Warden who departed this life at the young
age of 23 in 1847. To the side of John's memorial is a fallen stone shaled into
a zillion parts. Thus the inscription is unknown to me. Mr. Fred Hawkin's
&quot;Cemeteries of Maury County&quot; may list this grave or it could be in the
book &quot;They passed this way&quot;, but, I don't know its identity. It is
an 1850s era stone identical to the stone of William Kerr, Robert K. Campbell,
George B. Harris, Mildred L. Martin and the infant daughter of W.G. and M.J. Martin.
Be interesting to assemble a team of historical minded persons to extract the
pieces of this
memorial and re-assemble them to attempt to read the inscription. I have done
this for the William Kerr Memorial. However, the vital inscription information
from the William Kerr stone was recorded by previous cemetery researchers such as
Fred Hawkins and those preceding him. The small stones on your right are
foot stones of graves further to our right. Two of the three box tombs on the
left belong to Thomas and Nancy Jackson. It is the memorial tomb of of Jordan Hobbs. Photo July 2002
