  <pre align="center"><b><font  color="#800000">  KERR, Emmaline F (Faithie Ann Emmaline Campbell)., 28 Jan 1822 - 9 May 1844;. (22-03-11.)  &quot;Consort of W. N. (Willian N. Kerr; daughter of John &amp; Sara Campbell.&quot;

Note: 9 Dec 2002, from Professor Campbell Pennington of Texas (b. abt 1920, I think retired from Texas Tech) about William N &amp; Emmaline (Campbell)Kerr.
He described himself as a &quot;cultural geographer,&quot; by profession, but I believe he taught Historical Geography: &quot;Faithie Emeline Campbell (1822-1844) Aunt 
Faithie and Uncle William are tucked away at Shane's Cemetery, as you know. And it was to descendants of their one child, Sarah Ann Emeline KERR STANLEY
ATKISSON referred to in connection with recent lunch on an occasion. You should see the photographs of a daughter of Sarah Ann Emeline KERR who
married John Stanley. Her name was Mary Florence Stanley Hornsby. She was breathtakingly beautiful as a girl and as an older woman. I actually knew her before she died in 1927, in Austin, Tx. I will
never forget her because on my 6th birthday, in Texas, she came with a Tiddly-Winks set, plunked herself down at one end of the piano bench and proceeded
to instruct me in the niceties of tiddly winks!&quot; [C.P. abt 2004.]

Note from Judy Diaz: Regarding the daughter Sarah Ann Emeline Kerr. Sarah A. Emeline Kerr was married to two men. The first was John A. Stanley whom she married 10 Dec 1867 in 
Maury County. John died in 1873 and is buried in this cemetery. This left Sarah with 2 young daughters. Sarah then married Yerby Adkisson b. 1821 of this neighborhood who died in 1889. There is some mystery
as to whether she had 2 children with Yerby and who raised them. She is found living in Texas in 1900 and on the 1900 census she shows having 4 living children but only her daughters are with her. Her
daughter by John A. Stanley was Mary Florence Stanley &amp; she married Texas lawyer and State Senator John William Hornsby. Mary Florence died in 1927 and was the one referred to above by Campbell Pennington.
