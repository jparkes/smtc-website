is another version of the graphic imagery of an exact replica of the face plate of the fallen stone of William Kerr.
Out in the Cemetery a
memorial to his daughter Permelia is on the
right and on the left is the stone of Mary Crafton his 2nd wife. His first wife
was known to be Kate Ross by whom he fathered most of the children before she
died in 1827. William is known to have been the father of at least eighteen children if not more. The name and date are exact. The epitaph
is
correct but incomplete due to the breakup of the stone. For an in-depth analysis
of the nature of the stone restoration effort see the Cemetery restoration
section.</b></p>
