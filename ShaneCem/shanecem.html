View of part of the Shane Cemetery looking east. Large memorial in the center is
that of Claborn Taylor. Large monument on the left is that of a Martha Ann Campbell Morris
who married John T. Morris. A
stone of that magnitude today could cost more than $10,000. Many of the small stone in front are footstones of the Warden family
members. Very large Cedars abound in this cemetery probably about the age of the
cemetery, some of them are in a decaying state. Photo made in winter of 1990 by Wayne Austin.</b></p><center><img border="0" height="437" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ShaneCem/shanecem1.jpg" width="640"/></center>

<p align="center"><b>The memorial to John &amp; Priscilla (Warden) Kerr. John &amp; Priscilla
were new married youthful pioneers who set out to conquer 
the wilderness of West Tennessee in 1843. John set about clearing a large land
tract for farming, but soon lost his life to an infectious disease. Before his
sickness he was able to father
his only son Josephus Jerome. Priscilla &amp; son (they were dismissed
from the Clear Creek Church of Christ in McNairy Co.) returned to Maury
County in 1848 to live out their lives. Priscilla would later remarry to Mr. David
Wells who is buried close to his first two wives whom he outlived in the nearby Wells Cemetery.
