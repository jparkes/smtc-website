  <pre align="center"><b>     REDING, Susan A., 27 Nov 1839 - 20 Jun 1869. ï¿½Erected by J. G. Pullin.&quot;
 Susan A. Redding, buried at Shanes, died in 1869. She was the wife of 
Joseph T. Redding buried nearby. They married in October 1864, Maury Co. 
She's the daugher of Thomas and Sally Gilmer Pullen who lived near McCains and 
are buried at McCains. The J.G. Pullin who erected her stone is probably her brother 
Joseph Gilmer Pullin. He married a Brown from Giles Co. He was a Confederate Veteran 
who lost ne of his hands in battle. He and the Browns moved to TX in the 1870s. 
There's a narrative about their trip to TX on the Giles Co. website at rootsweb. 
It's an interesting read. Pat Cribbet 5/5/07      </b></font></pre>
