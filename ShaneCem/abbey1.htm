  This is Thompson's biographical entry in Goodspeed's History of Maury County: <br>
  &quot;THOMPSON S. CRAIG, was born in the Sixth District of Maury County May 9,
  1849, son of Nathaniel H. and Hattie (Scott) Craig. The father was born in
  North Carolina December 25, 1807. He was reared on the farm and was married in
  1828 and became the father of seven children. His death occurred in January,
  1886. He was the son of John and Lucinda Craig. The mother of our subject was
  born in Tennessee December 14, 1807, and died about 1872. She was the daughter
  of Samuel and Sarah Scott, natives of Ireland. Our subject passed his early
  life on the farm, and began business for himself at the age of twenty-three as
  a farmer. February 22, 1877, he wedded Ella Cline, a native of Canada, born
  January 2, 1858, and the daughter of John L. and Augusta (Simons) Cline. To
  our subject and wife were born four children: Emmit P., born in 1878; John L.,
  born in 1882; Ruby, born in 1883, and Samuel S., born in 1885. Mrs. Craig is a
  member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and is a warm advocate of
  Christianity. Mr. Craig is a Democrat, and a member of the Masonic fraternity.
  He is justly recognized by all as an honest, upright young man.&quot;<br>
