memory of her father ROBERT MATTHEW McCLAIN (1926 - 2003).&nbsp;<br>

McClain Cemetery is located approximately 1/4 mile across the Maury County into
Lewis County, Tennessee. The land for McClain Cemetery was donated by W.T.
McClain the son of John and Elizabeth McMillan McClain; and an early founder of
the Mt. Joy Church. This family was the first to be buried at McClain's. Nearby
is the Macedonia Church of Christ, in the middle of a fork in the road, right
side being Mt. Joy Rd. This church used to be the Old Macedonia School house,
the first school I ever attended. Miss Ava Stockard was my 1st grade teacher and
her sister Miss Annie Stockard was the substitute teacher. My sister Elizabeth
&quot;Liz&quot;, 2 years my junior was in the first grade with me at age 4. Now
how can that be? You might be thinking. Well, this was a very small community
and the only school for miles. My mother told me that, she was asked to put my
sister in school because if the school didn't have a certain number of children,
then there would be no school.&nbsp;<br>
I can't remember all of the students I went to school with, I was only 6 in the
first grade. The school was 1st thru 12th grades, one room, out-house and a
creek for our playground, there might have been two in the first grade, 1 in the
twelfth grade, nevertheless, 17 students were the total number during the year
that comes to mind.&nbsp; I
went to the first grade in 1953. There were McKIGHTS, FLIPPOS, BASSHAMS, RUNIONS
just to name a few of the seventeen. Macedonia School is where our Daddy and our
Granddaddy attended school. My sister Lizzie and I would walk from our house to
the school and return home every day. We passed the McClain cemetery every day
on that walk. To me, there
was no lovelier place in the world. The old Mt. Joy Road and the people that
lived there linger pleasantly in my memory. We had so much fun playing as little
girls in Mt. Joy, in this house or that house and carrying water and being
afraid of blue lizards.&nbsp;<br>
I remember going to the &quot;Old Williams Funeral Home&quot; in Mt. Pleasant,
Tennessee at times when a relative or special friend of the family would die. My
recollection covers many rides back up the rutty road on the hill to McClain's
Cemetery where they were laid to rest. As the years came and went, I traveled that road many times. It has now been layered with chirt and is in much
better condition. We lovingly laid to rest my aunts and uncles, my cousins, my
grandparents, my daughter and my Daddy. When the Lord calls me home, I too,
desire to be put to rest there among my ancestors and family. Many times my Dad and I
traveled that old road to tend to the various graves and he would tell me,
&quot;this stone or place is for your ggg-grandfather, or you were named after this person, or;
this man was exhumed for such and such a reason, and as a little boy I saw
it all&quot;. At any given time he would point down to a tombstone weathered and worn or a sunken
spot relating information that might now be lost in time. His hope was that we
would somehow retain all the details of his memory for I know he did this with
all of his children. I believe at one time he knew everyone up there on the beautiful hill,
and he would walk around and read the headstones and check the sunken places and
know if it was a child or an adult buried there. It did not matter to him if
there was a beautiful memorial at the head of the grave or just a sunken spot to
mark the place. Other than my Dad, there is one
other man that I know of in that area that would probably know more about the who is buried where in the McClain Cemetery. That would be Mr. Orin
Short of Lewis County. He is living next to the Cemetery. I suppose Jimmy
McClain would be knowledgeably also. I think Jimmy was a pall-bearer to almost
everyone around in that part of Lewis &amp; Maury Co., a very respectable citizen
of Mt. Joy and our cousin. Having said this, it is my desire to transcribe
the McClain Cemetery and perhaps reveal some of the people buried there.&nbsp;<br>
Though it is customary for only the inscriptions on the tomb stones to be typed
after the date, I have put the entire name as known by myself, my family, or found in reference materials that we have read. Biographies
are enclosed by parenthesis
are information I have either read or been told, and would like to share.<br>
<br>
The effort to list this cemetery is for my children James Tyson, and Tara Amanda Richardson; grandson
Alvaro Ruben' Aguilar; my mother Helen C. McClain; my beloved sister Margaret
Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; McClain Bradburn; my brothers Edwin Knox McClain,
and Michael Ephraim McClain, and their children. Knowing how much our Daddy
loved us all, I think we would like to have him listed at the beginning of
the transcription along with my daughter:<br>

 <pre>To me, doing genealogy is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead,
Breathing life into all who have gone before. To tell the family story and to 
feel that somehow they know and approve.
We are the story tellers of the tribe.
We have been called as it were by our genes.
Those who have gone before cry out to us: Tell our story.
So, we do.
In finding them, we somehow find ourselves.
How many graves have I stood before now and cried? I have lost count.
How many times have I told the ancestors you have a wonderful family, you 
would 
be proud of us?
How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow there was love 
there 
for me?
I cannot say.
It goes beyond just documenting facts. It goes to who am I and why do I do 
the 
things I do?
It goes to seeing a cemetery about to be lost forever to weeds and 
indifference
And saying I can't let this happen.
The bones here are bones of my bone and flesh of my flesh.
It goes to doing something about it.
It goes to pride in what our ancestors were able to accomplish.
How they contributed to what we are today.
It goes to respecting their hardships and losses, their never giving in or 
giving up,
Their resoluteness to go on and build a life for their family.
It goes to deep pride that they fought to make and keep us a Nation.
It goes to a deep and immense understanding that they were doing it for us.
That we might be born who we are.
That we might remember them. So we do.
With love and caring and scribing each fact of their existence,
Because we are them and they are us.
So, as a scribe called, I tell the story of my family.
It is up to that one called in the next generation,
To answer the call and take their place in the long line of family 
storytellers.
That is why I do my family genealogy,
And that is what calls those young and old to step up
And put flesh on the bones.</pre>

 <pre>(note:  This poem was sent to me in an e-mail some years ago.  The senders name was Ann Greer.
Ann Greer has a ancestor at McClain's Cemetery.  Her ancestor's name is Elizabeth Clenendin the
 lst wife of Martin McClain.  Elizabeth Clenendin McClain's sister was Telia Ann Clenendin McClain,
the wife of Dr. Ephraim McClain (Martin's brother), and the ggg-grandmother of Ann Greer, and 
her namesake.  
Ann writes to me:
&quot;Went to Lawrenceburg yesterday on husband's &quot;business&quot; and as we passed the cemetery, I saw 
&quot;Mimosa&quot; and a bell went off. I went back just before dark to look for the McClain grave markers, 
and found them in about three minutes. Of course, I had no camera with me, so that meant another 
trip back. Since her name was on there as Ann Clendenin, same as mine, it was a little eerie to 
look at. Such an unexpected find-------made my day.&quot;
I really do appreciate all the help Ann Greer has contributed to the information I share and wish
 to thank her very much. <i>[Mary Bob McClain Richardson]</i></pre>
