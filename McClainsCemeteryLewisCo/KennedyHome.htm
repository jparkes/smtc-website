During Feb 2005 this house was taken down piece by piece to be reconstructed in
Maury Co somewhere as a museum.&nbsp; Below is the last picture that will ever
be taken of the house as it stood, there is a vacant spot on the face of the
earth now.&nbsp; This was the house where Mary Bob McClain Richardson's father
Robert M. McClain was born.</br>

&nbsp;This is the side view of the house.&nbsp; The mail box and the county line
sit side by side to this property.&nbsp; Going south on Mt. Joy Road if you look
to your left just before the county line the house sits across the creek and
this is the side you would see if it were still standing. The old wall paper was
still on the wall. <i></br>

</i>Shelia Mcclain Williamson writes::&nbsp; I&nbsp; remember when I was a child we use to go to Pappa Turley's
back to the old cabin where Mammy lived. You could find dried peach seeds
scattered around from the many years of harvest. I remember Otto would pick up
the seeds and whittle them into a miniature basket. We kids use to pick them up
and play with them as anything like that was a prime toy since in those days toys sprung from anything of interest to
our keen little eyes and hands. Those were the days when our precious daddy was with us. Pappa Turley
would usually have a pocket full of candy that came from the nearby neighborhood store
of Roy Milan's.&nbsp;</br>
 We have really been blessed to have such a heritage as this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wayne thank you so much for bringing it all back to me!</br>
