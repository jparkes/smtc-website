<br>
HISTORY:&nbsp; Before the McClain/McLean family migrated to Tennessee they had
owned land in North Carolina and in Christian and McClain Counties, Kentucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Matthew McClain our great grandfather, was the second son of Martin and Nancy
Jane Beckum.&nbsp; He married Amelia Velina &quot;Bettie&quot; Kilpatrick.&nbsp;
Matthew and his brothers owned and operated a saw mill.&nbsp; He was constable
and magistrate and once said had seen more weddings and heard more trials than
he could count.&nbsp; In 1910 the County Court of Lewis
County appointed him Sheriff to fill a vacancy of the Sheriff who had died.&nbsp;
Matthew was later elected Sheriff and served until 1916.&nbsp; During that time
Matthew and his family made their home in the living quarters of the jail at
Hohenwald, in Lewis Co., Tennessee.&nbsp; Later, Matthew served as a guard at
the Tennessee State Prison in Nashville of Davidson County, Tennessee and at the
Criminal Insane Asylum in that city.&nbsp; In 1942 his son, Felix Martin was fatally
injured in an accident on the job as brakeman for the L &amp; N Railroad, in
Alabama, this is when Matthew and his family moved back to Hohenwald in Lewis
County.<br>
Betty Kilpatrick McClain, our great grandmother, was the daughter of ***William
A. Kilpatrick (b: 8 Oct 1843 d: 2 Nov 1874) and Mary Melvina Cooper Kilpatrick
Whitwell (b: 13 Jan 1846&nbsp; Newberg, Lewis Co., Tennessee&nbsp; d:&nbsp; 8
Dec 1938 Maury Co., Tennessee; the daughter of Lt. William McAdams Cooper CSA
and Louisa Elizabeth (Eliza Toombs).&nbsp; William A. and Mary Melvina
Kilpatrick were our great great grandparents.&nbsp; Bettie &quot;Grandmama Clain&quot;,
never knew her father.&nbsp; He died in November before she was born in
February.&nbsp; Her great grandfather, Col. Robert Melville Cooper became very
attracted to Bettie and gave her a silver spoon which he had brought with him
from South Carolina over the Lewis &amp; Clark Trail.&nbsp; Her mother, Mary Melvina had visited the Cooper family in Laurel, Mississippi going by boat.&nbsp;
She had a family chest which the Coopers' had brought back from Mississippi and
was later given to her sister, Thelma.&nbsp; Mary Melvina also had the family
Bible, marriage certificate of William McAdams Cooper and Elizabeth Toombs, but
the latter was destroyed.&nbsp; Bettie kept her mother's Bible and the records
in it have been used for compiling some of this family data.&nbsp; Mary
Melvina's father William McAdams Cooper was the first Major of Lewis County and
her grandfather Col. Robert Melville Cooper was the county Clerk.<br>
My Aunt Helen Jane Pinkley told me that Grandmama Clain ran a pretty tight
household, and was a very good cook.<br>
