the Robert Matthew

This not so great photo is a photo of a Civil War Reunion of old surviving
Soldiers which took place about 1905 <br/>
in the front yard of the above home. This picture hangs today on the walls of
this home. The big tree <br/>
in the left foreground was struck by lightning and had to be cut down.</b></p>
