This not so great photo is a photo of a Civil War Reunion of old surviving
Soldiers which took place about 1905 </br>
in the front yard of the above home. This picture hangs today on the walls of
this home. The big tree </br>
in the left foreground was struck by lightning and had to be cut down.</font></b></p>
