<p align="left">McClain/McLean History<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY:  Before the McClain/McLean family migrated to Tennessee they had
owned land in North Carolina and in Christian and McClain Counties, Kentucky.  
Matthew McClain our great grandfather, was the second son of Martin and Nancy
Jane Beckum.  He married Amelia Velina "Bettie" Kilpatrick. 
Matthew and his brothers owned and operated a saw mill.  He was constable
and magistrate and once said had seen more weddings and heard more trials than
he could count.  In 1910 the County Court of Lewis
County appointed him Sheriff to fill a vacancy of the Sheriff who had died. 
Matthew was later elected Sheriff and served until 1916.  During that time
Matthew and his family made their home in the living quarters of the jail at
Hohenwald, in Lewis Co., Tennessee.  Later, Matthew served as a guard at
the Tennessee State Prison in Nashville of Davidson County, Tennessee and at the
Criminal Insane Asylum in that city.  In 1942 his son, Felix Martin was fatally
injured in an accident on the job as brakeman for the L &amp; N Railroad, in
Alabama, this is when Matthew and his family moved back to Hohenwald in Lewis
County.<br/>
Betty Kilpatrick McClain, our great grandmother, was the daughter of ***William
A. Kilpatrick (b: 8 Oct 1843 d: 2 Nov 1874) and Mary Melvina Cooper Kilpatrick
Whitwell (b: 13 Jan 1846  Newberg, Lewis Co., Tennessee  d:  8
Dec 1938 Maury Co., Tennessee; the daughter of Lt. William McAdams Cooper CSA
and Louisa Elizabeth (Eliza Toombs).  William A. and Mary Melvina
Kilpatrick were our great great grandparents.  Bettie "Grandmama Clain",
never knew her father.  He died in November before she was born in
February.  Her great grandfather, Col. Robert Melville Cooper became very
attracted to Bettie and gave her a silver spoon which he had brought with him
from South Carolina over the Lewis &amp; Clark Trail.  Her mother, Mary Melvina had visited the Cooper family in Laurel, Mississippi going by boat. 
She had a family chest which the Coopers' had brought back from Mississippi and
was later given to her sister, Thelma.  Mary Melvina also had the family
Bible, marriage certificate of William McAdams Cooper and Elizabeth Toombs, but
the latter was destroyed.  Bettie kept her mother's Bible and the records
in it have been used for compiling some of this family data.  Mary
Melvina's father William McAdams Cooper was the first Major of Lewis County and
her grandfather Col. Robert Melville Cooper was the county Clerk.<br/>
My Aunt Helen Jane Pinkley told me that Grandmama Clain ran a pretty tight
household, and was a very good cook.<br/>
