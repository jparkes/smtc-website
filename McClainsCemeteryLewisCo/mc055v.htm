&nbsp;&quot;MOUNT JOY &quot; Editor Record: Since our last letter the grim angle of
death winged its way to the home of Mr. and Mrs. A. Goodman, and claimed for its
victim the spirit of their eldest son, Mr. Ben Goodman. He was sick only two
weeks with typhoid-pneumonia. Mr. Goodman was 21 years of age and leaves to
mourn their loss a devoted wife and little son, about 17 months old; a father,
mother, three sisters and two brothers, besides a host of friends and relatives.
He was loved by all his acquaintances. His home life was perfect, and he was the
pride of his fond parents, and it seems so hard that he should be taken from
loved ones in the early prime of manhood. But all should remember that God does
all things for the best. He was laid to rest in the McClain cemetery Wednesday
afternoon at 1 o'clock. May God watch over the broken hearted widow and
fatherless child, and heal their sorrows.&quot;<br>
