<pre align="center"><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>KENNEDY, James William, 12 Oct 1857 - 8 Jun 1949, son of Weakley Gordon and Sarah Ann 
Stockard.  Jim Kennedy was first married Sarah Ellen Pickard on 22 Sept. 1885. She died
November 17, 1886 and is probably buried here in an unmarked grave. Jim's second wife was 
Nancy Elizabeth Hunt. His father, Weakley, was a Civil War soldier and died in St. Louis, 
Missouri as a prisoner of the Union Army. He is buried at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.
Jim's mother, Sarah Ann, married three more times after Weakley's death. She married James N. 
Pugh, Wesley Scribner, and finally, Caleb S. Williams. She is buried at McClain Cemetery in an 
unmarked grave, just below Jim's grave, beside her twin grandsons, Otto and Otis Kennedy. 
Update: A new memorial was added recently to celebrate the life of Sarah Ann Stockard by her 
descendents. [2/5/2005, Mary Bob Richardson, updated by WA]
