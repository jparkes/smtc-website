From Mt Pleasant take Cross Bridges Road north and west for about 2 miles and
turn left on the Roy Thompson Road. Bend back north and take the right fork into
Rippey Lake Road and go until it bends and take the farm road straight ahead for
200 yards to the end of the hedge row where the gate goes into the next field on
your right. With permission to get thru the locked gate follow the path up the
hill east but slightly southward toward the tree line. Go into the trees and the
cemetery will be there in the forest surrounded by a three foot high rock wall
about 2 feet thick. The rock wall is still in good shape and therefore the
cemetery is also well preserved except for underbrush.   <br/>
