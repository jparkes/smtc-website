<font color="#000080" size="2">Samuel Cecil memorial. This stone is about 6 feet in length. We can see here why this type of stone rarely
falls when set deeply into the ground. It was obviously uprooted probably by a
large tree falling on it, a vandal digging it up, or maybe the stone fell into the caved in
or vandalized grave and was extracted by someone.<br>
