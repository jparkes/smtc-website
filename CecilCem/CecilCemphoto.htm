The cemetery is located in the clump of trees shown above near this side. Go into the trees and the
cemetery will be there in the forest surrounded by a three foot high rock wall
about 2 feet thick. The rock wall is still in good shape and therefore the
cemetery is also well preserved except for out of control underbrush. I did
whack down most of the 1&quot; thick saplings that clustered about to get better
photos. I say evidence of many stumps indicating someone had cleaned the
cemetery in years past. Setting up a few stones and clearing the weeds would go
along way toward preservation of this historic site. <br>
