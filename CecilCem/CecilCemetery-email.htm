You have pictures of gravestones of my husband's
GGgrandmother and GGgrandfather -- Samuel and Sarah Brown Cecil [1780s-1840s
range, in Cecil cemetery].&nbsp;</br>
His other GGgrandfather Lewis Green Lanier is interred in the nearby Arlington 
Cemetery, Mt Pleasant.</br>
His Ggrandmother Mary Jane Lanier Cross [Hunter Cemetery]</br>
His other Ggrand mother Julia Ingram Cecil [Mrs. James Harvey, Lawrence
Cemetery]&nbsp;</br>
Unfortunately James Harvey Cecil himself is in Lawrence Cemetery also, but was not
photographed, probably his stone was not in good enough shape. <i>(No! It was
just not photographed by MBR that day)</i></br>
Several of their daughters are buried near them at Lawrence Cemetery.</br>
Their oldest son, Samuel Shelby Cecil, my husband's grandfather and Mary Jones
Cross Cecil --his Grandmother,-- are missing, but probably buried in Cecil
Cemetery or maybe Lawrence Cemetery without a stone. They died in their 40s in
1891 and 1892.</br>
James Harvey's brothers, William and John W. Cecil are both buried in the Cecil
cemetery with their parents, Sam and Sarah--one spouse, and many of William's
descendants.</br>
I appreciate your efforts and those of the others who have so tirelessly worked
on gathering these pictures.</br>

</font><b>Zachariah Cecil b. 1758 [Son of Samuel
and Rebecca White Cecil] and his wife Nancy Ingram Cecil -- both b. in Maryland,
relocated to Virginia and then to Shelby county Ohio with all of their sons and
daughters [ some later went to Delaware County Ind]</br>
EXCEPT Samuel [Ingram] Cecil -b. 1/31/1784 - their eldest who -- married Sarah
Brown -b. 18 Jun 1785 and stayed in Virginia, [Montgomery or later Pulaski
County] where all of their four sons and two daughters were born.</br>
</br>
Their eldest William Ingram Cecil b. 9 Jan 1809 went to visit family in Indiana,
and married Elizabeth Ribble there in 1832. Their first four children were born
there but the family moved in 1840 to Maury County TN and settled there farming
and adding 8 more children. [William and Eliz and most of their children are
buried in the Cecil Family cemetery except for their sons Lloyd Cecil and John
W. Cecil and families who are buried in Cross Bridges Methodist cemetery.]</br>
</br>
Second son John Wilkerson Cecil, b. 1810, also went to Indiana, married a cousin
Sarah Ann Butler Cecil b. 1818 and 4 of their 7 children were born in Indiana,
the last 3 in Maury Co TN, where they moved about 1843-45. [ Their four
youngest, Samuel R.,William C, Mary E. and John White Cecil are all buried in
the Cecil Family Cemetery.]</br>
</br>
Third son [ our ancestor] James Harvey Cecil b. 5 Jul 1812 came to Maury County
in about 1840 with brother William, and they bought land near each other . Soon
after that they went back to Va. for their parents, Samuel and Sarah and brought
them to TN. James Harvey worked the farm on which the parents settled and
married late--in 1847, to Julia Elizabeth Ingram. b. 8 Dec 1825 in Ky.</br>
[I have HER stone from LAWRENCE Cemetery, but NOT JAMES HARVEY CECIL whose grave
should be right there beside hers.] All of their children were born in Maury
County.</br>

William Greenberry 1861 and wife are believed buried in Ardmore Oklahoma, and
eldest son [Richard's grandfather] Samuel Shelby Cecil b. 24 Jul 1851 d. 26 Feb
1892 in Mt Pleasant, but no word where he and wife Mary Jones Cross Cecil
[1852-1891] are buried. -- Probably in Cecil Family Cemetery w/o a headstone.</br>
Her mother Mary Jane Lanier Cross is interred in Hunter Cemetery [Father died in
the war] and her Grandfather, Lewis Green Lanier 1799-1881 is buried in
Arlington Cemetery.</br>

there?</br>

Hello. My husband's grandparents died in Maury County, probably Mt Pleasant in 
??1891 [Mary Cross Cecil age about 41 ] and&nbsp; Feb 26, 1892 [Samuel Shelby 
Cecil age about 42, said to have died of consumption]. I have never found a 
funeral notice nor a place of burial for them. </br>
Her mother: Mary Jane Lanier Cross. d. Jan 22 1853 and is buried in Hunter 
Cemetery.&nbsp; Father: John Finch Cross died in Civil War.</br>
</br>
His parents, James Harvey Cecil&nbsp; 8 Jul 1812 - 28 Dec 1883&nbsp; and Julia 
Ingram Cecil 8 Dec 1825 - 8 May 1876 are buried with three daughters in&nbsp; 
Lawrence Cemetery in Mt Pleasant., Tn.</br>
Two of these sisters of Sam's were still living when Sam and his wife died.... 
guess they had no family feeling for him though, since no one thought to mark 
their&nbsp; graves. </br>
&nbsp;</br>
James Harvey's older brothers William and John Cecil&nbsp; [ both with extensive&nbsp; 
families ] also were living in the area until 1909 and 1910. </br>
Does anyone know where Sam and Mary Cross Cecil are buried... ???? or how I 
might find a record of either's death ???</br>
Also Are there any&nbsp; descendants of William or John or younger brother 
Shelby or sister Nancy Brown [Samuel Finley Cecil]&nbsp; doing research in the 
area or on any of these families?</br>
Any help greatly appreciated.</tt></font></p>
