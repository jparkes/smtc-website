Lewis Co., Tennessee Buried: Bailey Cemetery, Mt. Joy, Maury Co., Tennessee
married: 22 Sept 1885 to James W. Kennedy (the great grandfather of Mary Bob
McClain Richardson), who was the son of Weakly Gordon Kennedy and Sarah Ann
Stockard).</br>
James William Kennedy Born: 12 Oct 1857 Died: June 1949 Buried: McClain
Cemetery, Lewis Co., Tennessee is located 1/4 mile across the Maury Co. line on
Mt. Joy Road.</br>
The grave is also unmarked. Not sure where it is at in the cemetery. It has been
told and handed down through the years that Sadie's parents and family moved
from the Mt. Joy area while Sadie was pregnant with her daughter, Jennie Pearl
Kennedy who married Argles King. Her parents and other family members moved to
Texas going on a Wagon Train that consisted of members of the Cooper, Hunt,
Pickart, Christian and Rochelle families from the area. It is said that Sadie
was so upset by the move of her family that she grieved herself to death, dying
when her daughter, Jennie, was only 4 months old. The Christian family that went
on this train did not like Texas and did not stay very long at all. As soon as
they made enough money they set out to come back to Lewis County, Tennessee
where they remained. Many of the ancestors of that family are still in this area
today. (Wayne, I overlooked Sarah Ellen. I am glad Mary Bob informed us that
she was buried here in one of the unmarked graves.)</b></p>
