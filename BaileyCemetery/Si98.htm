Original stone for Judy Skipper Sims also known here as Julia H. Sims. There is 
a noted date difference in the dates <br>
from the recent stones. Likely the recent stone have the correct dates, but I am 
unaware of the particulars. <i>[CWA 2 Nov 2010] </i> <br>

Text of Wes Pullen's E-mail<br>
</b>Julia H. Sims and Judy Skipper Sims are indeed the same person. This was the stone I replaced at the cemetery with blessing of my 
half sister, Mary Frances Crowder and the cemetery caretaker, Williard Grimes. 
Mary Frances was about 12 when the drowning happened and was at the funeral. Now for the rest of the story. James and Judy Sims had three children. Jimmy, Larry and David. When the tragedy happened James saved Jimmy but was unable to save Judy, 
David and Larry. David being a baby was found in his mothers arms, but little Larry's body was never found. This was told to me by my half sister.
