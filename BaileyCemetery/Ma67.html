Anthony Ray, 10 Jun 1954 - 10 Sep 1973 (son of John Ellis Mathis, Jr.; AB, USAF,
Vietnam)<i>. Information and photo by Rick Gray, 11/12/2004</i>. Anthony was
killed at home in a car accident. I can't remember if he was on leave from
Vietnam or had already returned home. I did read that he died in a car accident
at Mt. Joy but do not remember all the details. (R.G. 11/16/04).</br>
