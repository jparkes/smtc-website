<pre align="center"><b>Staggs, Noble, 23 Jun 1915 � 18 Oct 1998 (husband of Mary Alice Brown; son of Charlie Staggs and Blanche Ellen Ashmore) 
and
Staggs, Mary Alice Brown, 1 Aug 1923 � 1 Aug 1923 - 12 Aug 2009 (wife of Noble Staggs; daughter of Willis Franklin Brown and Mary Alice Lindsey)

There is an Undertakers Marker that has stood beside his father-in-law's (Willis Franklin Brown) tombstone for 
many years. Uncle Noble lost his right arm in a farming accident many years ago. They carried the arm to 
Bailey Cemetery and buried it between James Richard Brown and Willis Franklin Brown. An undertakers marker
 has marked the spot for years.
