This is a photo across the back of the left side of the cemetery. The left side
is where most of&nbsp;<br>
the older graves and tombstones are located.<br>

This is the front of the left side of the cemetery. The cemetery sets on a hill
and has stairs on each end of the&nbsp;<br>
cemetery leading up to it. You can partially see the front part of the cemetery
and the distance from the road.<br>
This shot is of the later graves. <br>

Another shot from about the center of the cemetery toward the left. The center
in the <br>
foreground has a lot of unmarked graves or those marked by fieldstones.</font></b></p>
