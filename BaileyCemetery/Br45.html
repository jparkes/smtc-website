<pre align="center"><b> Brown, Adron, 1907 � 1907 (infant child of Willis Franklin Brown and Frankie Lindsey) 
</b>Just an interesting note. His death is what brought my great-grandparents together. 
Papa Will's first wife as stated above was Frankie Lindsey, my great-aunt. When she became 
pregnant, the story is that the pregnancy was rough on her. Frankie's sister, Mary, came to 
help her out. When Aunt Frankie died giving birth to Adron, Mary continued to go by and help care 
for Adron and help Papa Will out. Little Adron died a few months later, but love blossomed for 
Will and Mary. They married in 1908. In 1940, after 32 years of marriage and 16 
kids later, their union was dissolved when Papa Will died after a short illness. Granny Brown
 (as we affectionately called her) died in 1986 at the age of 95 - she was still wearing the wedding 
ring he gave her when she died. The ring is now in the possession of one of her daughters.<b>
