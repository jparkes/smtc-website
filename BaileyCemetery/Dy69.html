Dycus, Eliza E., 8 Jul 1849 - 17 Mar 1918. There are 3 photos attached
here. One of these is a photo of the Eliza Dycus stone. The second picture is a
photo of the P for Pollock. Around the 3 stones of W. Jim Pollock, Rebecca
Ledbetter "Bettie" Pollock, and Eliza E. Dycus are 4 of these P's -
one in each corner as usual indicating this is a Pollock plot. The 3rd picture
shows the 3 stones together. I took this to show the relationship of Eliza Dycus
to the Pollocks. I do not know what the relationship might have been. She is not
Bettie's Pollocks mother but could be Jim Pollock's. I am not sure.<br/>
