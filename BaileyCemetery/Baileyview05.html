An area shot showing the right side of the cemetery. That is my son, Andrew,
reading one of the tombstones. <br/>
He was a big help to me on this project. You can see in front of him a vast
number of fieldstones. <br/>
Many of the fieldstones here look like they were once small tombstones but no
longer have any inscription at all.
They are completely smooth. Several of the fieldstones in this grave have
flowers on them, indicating that a
family member knows who is buried there.<br/>

Another shot of the wide area of this cemetery that has no tombstones. I was
told <br/>
several years ago by the caretaker that this area is full of unmarked graves. So
folks you will <br/>
just have to continue to ponder in the future whose ancestors are interred here.
