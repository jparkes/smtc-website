</p><center><b>This is a photo
of a stone that I could not find anything on the last time I was there.
Yesterday I gently scraped the stone after seeing the faint outline of a letter.
It revealed the letters or word: LAD The first photo is of the stone showing the
LAD. The second picture is showing the stone with another small stone behind it.
It could have been a headstone at one time, I am not sure on that one. There is
nothing faint at all on that stone. If it was ever engraved with anything it is
blank now. The third picture shows part of the relation of this stone to others
in the cemetery. Just to the right of it are the stones of Bliss Beckum and
James H. King. The fourth picture shows another part of its relation to other
stones. The two stones right behind it are the stones of Ruth S. Pickard
Williams and Rebekah S. Pickard.<i><br/>
