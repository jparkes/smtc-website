I took this photo on the left side looking over to the right side of the
cemetery. The stones in the center of the photo are of Alexander Pickard, Rachel
Pickard and W. P. Pickard. Alex and W. P. Pickard are the two tall stones in the
front. They were possibly father and son but don't know that for sure. I have
been told by a reliable source that Rachel was Alexander's wife. Some might
question why she wasn't buried beside him as we have become accustomed to
seeing. One of the traditions among some of the religions and practiced even in
death by many of those who strictly adhered to its teachings was that the wife
was always in subjection to the husband even in death. Him being buried in front
of her was a symbol of this subjection. I have a great-aunt and great-uncle who
are buried at McClain Cemetery and are buried the same way. Their daughter told
her children and grandchildren about the tradition and that is why her parents
were buried that way. Also notice the blue flowers in the photo. There is no
marker there. Not sure if the flowers are meant to be there or just blew off
another grave. You can see again that large area in the center of the cemetery
where there are no markers at all. <br>

Another shot from the same direction as the last - just spanning further back.
The very back large stone in the (our left) foreground of the picture is that of
William L. Gordon, a Bailey family descendant. Along that back row after you
pass his grave going back to the right, you will see a large number of unmarked
graves. They are clearly indented where the graves are at. Look at the next
picture to see the area.<br>

I wanted to take this one because it is clearly evident that beside the grave of
William L. Gordon there are quite a few unmarked graves. In this area, for some
reason, the unmarked graves really stand out. They are clearly indented and in
some of the grass is always a different color.
