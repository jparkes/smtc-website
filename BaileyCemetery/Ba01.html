<pre align="center"><b>Bailey, Annie M., 25 Jul 1867 - 12 Nov 1871. </b>Note: She is buried between John H. &amp; Nancy A. Bailey - 
possibly a daughter or granddaughter. On the 1870 census, Nancy is listed as head of 
household. The youngest in the household is an A. M. Bailey. She is the right age to be Annie, 
but is listed as black (all other Baileys in household are white). It could be a mistake and this is their 
daughter, born just before John died in 1868. <b>Most of the engraving is under the ground now. 
The name can be made out and part of the birth. Death Date from MCTC.
