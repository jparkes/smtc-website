</p><center><b>King, James, 14
Jul 1793 - 8 Oct 1870 (husband of Delia Pickard; son of Thomas &amp; Mary King;
one of the founders of the Mt. Joy Cumberland Presbyterian Church) Unknown
broken unreadable memorial stone, this is a broken stone that is between A. G. King and
George M. Williams. There is nothing left of the other part of the stone. This
picture of the broken stone is in line with the head stones indicating this is a
broken headstone. The foot stone is still there for the stone. There are the
clear initials J. K. This makes me believe the
stone  is the remnants of the stone for James H. King, 14 Jul 1793 - 8 Oct
1871. Mr. Hawkins stated when he was there in the 80's that Mr. King's stone's
top was broken off. This stone and footstone found between A. G. King and George M.
Williams is the stone (I believe) for James King detailed above according to Mr.
Fred's records in "M.C.T.C.".<i><br/>
