CEMETERY, MT JOY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE&nbsp;</br>

This is the front corner of the left side of the cemetery. The tombstone of
Basil &amp; Rena Gilmore Beckum is the one in the very corner. There are several
of the Bailey family still in this area. Also quite a few of the Beckum family
in the front part there. The stone with the pointed top is the grave of
Josephine Beckum. Once again I point out all the open area with no stones and
the small unmarked stones. The large stone next to the old tree trunk is the
stone of Willis McKinley Bailey and his wife, Eliza Grimes. This stone was
donated by the grandchildren sometime after the couple died. It is also is for
their children who are buried here too. Many of the unmarked graves in this area
probably belong to their children. The nice marker in the right foreground
corner that is only partially above ground, I believe, has engraving on it but
it is all underground.</br>

This is close up view of the 3 Pickard stones that are toward the center of the
cemetery almost by themselves as there is a huge area of unmarked graves in this
area. It is is after you leave the heavily populated stones of the left side of
the cemetery. The middle part there is full of unmarked graves and those only
marked by fieldstones. These 3 are all Pickards - Alexander S. Pickard is the
first stone on the left; to the right of him is W. P. Pickard (relationship
unknown, but possible brothers or cousins); and behind Alexander S. Pickard is
his wife Rachel S. Pickard. As I have told you before information was handed
down to me from a great-aunt via a cousin of mine, that it was a tradition in
that day and time for wives to be buried behind their husbands. This is only the
3rd time I have run across it in my cemetery findings. All 3 of them have been
in the Mt. Joy area. There of course could have been more examples if all the
graves here were marked.</b></p>
