<p>Hi Wayne,</br>
Can I get Joe Irwin added to the Bailey Cemetery on Joy Road in Mt. Pleasant. I
am sending documents to show he is buried there. He is in an unmarked grave and
I didn't find him listed in the cemetery book or the website. His daughter is my
second cousin. She is about 80 and lives here in Mt. Pleasant. She was just a
little girl when he got killed.</br>
Her children were going to have a stone put in for him, but when she went to the
cemetery she couldn't remember where he was buried. She said it was close to a
tree, but there are several tree stumps there now. He was the adopted son of Mr.
and Mrs Houston Irwin who are also buried there. The dates are listed on the
death certificate. If you need anymore info just let me know.</br>
Thanks Charlotte Colvett<b></br>
