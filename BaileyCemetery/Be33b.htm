Beckum, Earnest, 10 Mar 1885 - 18 Mar 1885. The stone is buried in with the
Beckum family. This tombstone is almost laying on the ground now - leans
backwards a great deal. The vital inscription says &quot;In Memory of EARNEST
BECKUM, Born Mar 10 1995 Died Mar 18, 1855&quot;&nbsp;There
is a George Rufus Beckum, son of James T. Beckum, who is believed to be buried near here. His son Basil is buried near these Beckum
stones also. George
Rufus married Alice Barnes - so Earnest could be their child.<br>
