This is a photo across the back of the left side of the cemetery. The left side
is where most of <br/>
the older graves and tombstones are located.<br/>

This is the front of the left side of the cemetery. The cemetery sets on a hill
and has stairs on each end of the <br/>
cemetery leading up to it. You can partially see the front part of the cemetery
and the distance from the road.<br/>
This shot is of the later graves. <br/>

Another shot from about the center of the cemetery toward the left. The center
in the <br/>
foreground has a lot of unmarked graves or those marked by fieldstones.</b></p>
