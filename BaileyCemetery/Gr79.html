</b>The footstone at Daddy's grave incorrectly reflects his year of birth as 1924. Daddy was born 20 September 1925. 
He lied about his age on his enlistment form in order to join the US Navy during WWII. He made himself one year 
older (1924) to be able to join. As a result of this government &quot;fib&quot;, his Social Security Death record also records 
his year of birth as 1924.
Clarence Walton &quot;Red&quot; Grimes was the first child of Clarence Gracie &quot;Boots&quot; Grimes (son of Samuel Augusta &quot;Gus&quot; 
Grimes and Dora Bailey Grimes) and Ida Rosa &quot;Rosie&quot; Vandygriff Grimes (daughter of Rufus Ruff Vandygriff and 
Carrie Burleson), born 20 Sep 1925 in Maury County, Tennessee. The nickname &quot;Red&quot; came about because of 
his bright red hair.
Daddy enlisted in the U.S. Navy during WWII at the age of 15, having lied about his age on his enlistment form. He 
served in the Pacific, including the Philippines. His rank was SC3. I have photos of him as a sailor and will provide you
with one as soon as I can dig them up. He served as a cook in the Navy and his cooking in civilian life reflected that 
experience. He was an amazing cook.
While in California in 1945, he met and married my mother, Norma Faye Watt, in a double wedding ceremony with my 
Mom's father, Frank Watt and his new bride, Audrey. They were married 8 December 1945 at Belvedere Gardens, Los 
Angeles City, Los Angeles County, California. My Mom, Norma Faye Watt Grimes, is a native Californian, born 26 April 
1928, in Los Angeles, CA to Frank Watt and Alberta Payne Watt.
Although a farmer by birth, Daddy was more an entrepreneur, owning two business with my mother, Norma, including 
a drive-in restaurant and a used car dealership. He also worked for chemical companies, including Monsanto (I believe).
Daddy began having health problems at the age of 38, when he experienced his first heart attack. I remember that day 
clearly, as I was at 4-H camp at the time and was told of his hospitalization just before I took my Red Cross swimming 
test, to receive my certification. I recall sinking like a rock because I couldn't concentrate on anything other than my
 Dad. Over the next few years, Daddy experienced 4 more heart attacks, the fifth one dealing the fatal blow in our 
home at 410 Wall Street, Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, on 5 August 1967. My mother, my two younger sisters, Denise and 
Debbie, Dr. J.O. Williams, and I were present at the time of Daddy's death.
Daddy's wake was held, as was the custom at the time, at the home of my grandparents, Clarence and Rosie Grimes. 
Daddy's body laid in my grandparents living room until the day of his burial, 7 August 1967. The funeral was held at 
Williams Funeral Home in Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, followed by interment at Bailey Cemetery, Mt. Joy, Maury, 
Tennessee. Daddy received a funeral with full military honors and the flag from his coffin was given to my mother.</pre>
