This photo looks out onto the King and Pickard tombstones on the left side of
the cemetery. Many of them are started to lean with the weight of time. You can
see one on the line with King graves (front row of tall stones) that has broken.
All of the engraving/inscription on that stone is gone. From the front of the
picture it is the second in that row.<br>

This photo is of the back corner of the left side of the Bailey Cemetery. The
cows in the back field which I believe belongs to Willard Grimes (current
caretaker for the cemetery) show that the cemetery is in a rural area. In the
very back corner you will find the majority of the Grimes family graves. Also on
the back row next to the fence you will find Samuel M. Craig's grave - his is
the one with the Confederate Star stone at the foot. You can see on both sides
of his grave there is room for one of those graves to be for his wife Felicia
Bailey Craig. Buried at his foot is his son, J. Willie Craig. At the foot of
Willie is the grave of his cousin Dora Bailey Grimes. Next to her is her brother
Urastus O. Bailey. Then are Dora's grandparents, John and Nancy Bailey. This
area consists as you can tell of a great deal of the Bailey family and their
descendants. You will once again see several of the small stones that are
characteristic of this cemetery - no signs of any engraving on them.</font></b></p>
