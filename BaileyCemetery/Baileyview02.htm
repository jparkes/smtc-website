This is a shot taken at the (middle) back of the cemetery. It is panned out
over the Brown graves and some of the Johnston/Johnson graves. That is my mother
sitting on the bench that is in front of her gg uncle, Tom Johnston's grave.
Three graves down is his niece and Mom's grandmother, Mary Alice Lindsey Brown.</br>

This shot is shot toward the middle and right side of the cemetery. I took it to
show that in the middle there are a lots of unmarked graves and many marked by
fieldstones. The right side of the cemetery has more of the most recent graves
than any the left side.</b></p>
