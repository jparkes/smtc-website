<center><font color="#800000" size="2" ><b>Unknown, there is
no footstone at all with this stone. It most likely was another child. It is
located just to the left of J. D. Beckum.&nbsp;This could also be the stone of
John Wesley Gilmore that Mr. Hawkins said was there in the 80's. The stone is
next to the Beckums but it is also near the the Gilmore's stones too. So that is
another possibility. Chris C. Gilmore and his wife Ellen are not too far from
where the stone is at.<br>
