</b>At the base of the large tree on this side lies a Box Tomb. Just in front of
that is the base of a small box tomb and just in front of that is another large
box tomb very close to the ground. Our subject stone is the large upright
multi-tier stone just to the left of the last box tomb.</br>

RICHARDSON, Rev. Allen, 22 Feb 1797 - 11 Nov 1865. (Born in Wilkes Co., Ga.; Son
of Thomas &amp; Jane Willis Richardson; married 1st, Rebecca Bailey and 2nd,
Elizabeth Boaz Richardson brother to Ann Richardson Pullen; Corporal in Captain Samuel Ashmore's Company, War of
1812.&nbsp;From Carma Boaz: I remember this stone and thought his wife's
inscription is on the back side. Answer: Unfortunately I don't believe it is
which means I did not find a memorial for her, nor the first wife of Rev Allen
Rebecca. [WA, 6/20/06]</font><a href="mailto:marbles@texoma.net"></br>
