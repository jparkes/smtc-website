This view looking east down the north fence line shows the wide open spaces.
Perhaps many unmarked graves fill those open area. The New Ramah Baptist Church
was located (I believe) at one time to the left of the fence line.That pile of
stones next to the Elm tree is the replaced stone of Lucy J. Blankenship and
several footstones from the foot of graves. There is also a stone there that is
a broken memorial or a fieldstone perhaps marking a grave near there.<br>

&nbsp;This is a photo looking east from the western edge of the
cemetery. The southern fence can be seen on the right. The two little stones to
our far right are the first stones on the western edge of the cemetery. This is an extra wide picture made by
combining two photos. </b></font><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><font >Use your scroll bars to view the whole scene. </font><i>Photo
