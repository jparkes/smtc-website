<p align="center"><b>NEW RAMIE CEMETERY, STIVERSVILLE, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
</b>
STAFFORD, Thomas, born about 1816 or 1817 and died 
He died September 11, 1887 in Maury County Tennessee Stiversville Road area. Son 
of James and Mary (Eskridge) Stafford of Person County, North Carolina; then 
District 8, Fayette County, Tennessee in the early 1830sÂ  Thomas married 
1st Mary E. Bomer in Fayette County, TN on February 27, 1840 and they lived in 
the area of LaGrange, Fayette County, TN where they had three daughters, Louisa 
Jane, Mary T., and Sarah A. Thomas left his family and disappeared sometime 
between 1850 and 1860. Thomas returned to North Carolina after the Civil War 
because first went home to Fayette County, TN and found his wife and daughters 
had left. So he married 2nd to Sarah Ann Brown (who went by Sallie) of, and in, 
North Carolina in 1867 (see bible record below). At the time they married, she 
already had a son named Walter Brown. See below letter for rest of story.</p>

	The evidence for burial of Thomas Stafford in New Ramey Cemetery is: (1) "verbal" 
	family information handed down, (2) it is close to where he and his family 
	lived on Stiversville Road west of Stiversville - off Highway 31 south of the cemetery. 
	There are many cemeteries in the area of Stiversville Road where he lived. 
	No headstone for him has been found in any of them. With this, we can only "assume" he 
	is there in New Ramey. He will be documented as 
	"<i>most likely there in an unmarked grave</i>" He was born in 1816 and died about 1887. 
	From conversations with folks known to be at her funeral Thomas' wife was buried in an unmarked grave in 
	the Lynnwood Cemetery in Lynnville. Thomas is not in Lynnville because there is 
	no vacant graves left on either side of her. We know who are in those 
	graves. She was buried in one of her daughter's and son-in-laws Grissom 
	plots abt. 1913. <br/>
	<br/>
	Thomas J Stafford<br/>
	Birth: 1817<br/>
	Person County, North Carolina<br/>
	Death: 1887<br/>
	Maury County, Tennessee<br/>
	<br/>
	Ex-husband of Mary E. Bomer Stafford<br/>
	Husband of Sarah "Sallie" Ann Brown Stafford<br/>
	Stepfather of Walter Brown<br/>
	Father of: Luther, Mary, Ervin, Martha and Almond Stafford.<br/>
	<br/>
	Information handed down over the generations of Thomas Stafford descendants 
	states he was buried in New Ramey Cemetery (aka New Ramia Baptist Church 
	Cemetery)Culleoka, Maury Co. Tn. A survey of the known graves reveal he was 
	not listed. An on-site inspection of all headstones in 2010 by family 
	members indicated none of the headstones had his name on them. Many 
	headstones are damaged and have been moved. Also, records show that there 
	are several unmarked graves in this cemetery. It is believed by the 
	descendants of Thomas Stafford that he is buried here in an unmarked grave 
	with a destroyed/damaged headstone.<br/>
	This information was sent to me an a descendant who wishes to remain 
	anonymous.<br/>
