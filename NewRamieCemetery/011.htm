<font color="#000080" size="2">UNMARKED grave, next to the south fence of the
cemetery in the Dugger, Richardson, Scott area. (bottom photo). It is actually
marked with common field stones.<i>This tree has the
old replaced Lucy Blankinship stone lying against it along with numerous
footstones. Wish I had taken the time to get all the initials to see if there
was one without a headstone. Can see an AED and MD? and that is all because grass
covers the others. Most of those I see can be dated using styles of stone as
after 1880. [WA 4/23/2006]&nbsp;</i><br>
