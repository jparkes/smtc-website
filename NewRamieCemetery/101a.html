</b>Notice the little stone in the far right of the photo between us and the
large tree. It finally happened. I missed a stone. The photos I make allow me
normally to thoroughly investigate the cemetery, but I am not perfect and I get
no second chance. I failed to photograph this stone so I don't have a clue who
it belongs to.</br> </font>

The little round top stone in the bottom left
(same stone as above different angle of photography) forefront of the photo was
overlooked. I failed to photograph it. It is broken and the two broken parts of
the headstone are resting against what is probably the footstone. As stated
above I have not a clue what the inscription says. It is a problem when I am 80
miles away and discover an error. I do not get a second chance to correct the
omission in photography.&nbsp;</font></br>
