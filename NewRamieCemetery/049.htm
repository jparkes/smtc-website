BOAZ, Mariah Bullington, born May 3,1785 and died August 23, 1852. born May 
3,1785 and died August 23, 1852. (w/o William Boaz Boaz (1778 - 1852) d/o Robert 
&amp; Elizabeth Granger Crenshaw Bullington.) no stone found.<br>
Unknown Pile of stones,&nbsp; in the Pullen, Richardson area. This may be the remnants
of the <a href="044.htm">memorial for William &amp; Mariah (Bullington) Boaz.</a>
 Do not lock down on that as it is not fact just theory. I say this because it appears to be an 1850s box tomb style
memorial with the top perhaps disintegrated or missing. Box tombs with the loose stone base
were not common after the 1850s. That flat stone on the bottom right corner may
have been a part of the top along with the many flat pieces lying all around. If
this were investigated there may be pieces that have the inscription that may be
reassembled to reconstruct the inscription. That is a slow process taking
usually many hours. <font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="mailto:marbles@texoma.net"><br>
