Carma Boaz furnished this photo made in 1995 of the hugh Beech Tree that grew
for hundreds of years in the cemetery. It was still healthy when the photo was
taken, but when I visited there in 2005 the top had fallen. Could have been a
lightning strike. Mr Fred Hawkins said it was one of the largest Beech trees in
Maury County and that is plain to see here.</b></font>
