</b>The large Beech tree in the center back part of the photo has a row of small
upright stones. These are between us and the tree. We will document those from the stone closest
to the Beech tree and moving toward us. Looks to be&nbsp;about seven memorials of the
Hickman, Leneave and others.</br>

A closer up photo showing the our subject row. The large dying Beech tree has a
history of being one of the largest beech trees in the County. Soon it will be
gone as the top is complete broken now.</br>

That pile of shaled fragments is actually the base where the stone should sit,
but is too far gone.</br>

APPERSON, Mary, 20 Apr 1784 - 1 Jun 1851. &quot;Consort of Samuel Apperson.'
Transcription: &quot;In memory of MARY APPERSON, consort of Samuel Apperson who
was born April 20th 1784 and died June 1, 1851.&quot; This stone is broken and
was found leaning against the identical style stone of Martha Blankinship just
to the south. It was so fragile that I broke some of the inscription from the
bottom just moving it out to read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><i></br>
