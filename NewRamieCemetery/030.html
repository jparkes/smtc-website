 </b>First box tomb just to the left under the tree in the distance. The lichen
is so tough it will need to be killed to attempt to read this stone. The white
spot on the edge is my clipboard. There is another tomb just to the other side
not visible in this photo. It belongs to Elmore Hickman.<b></br>

Unknown unreadable stone. under the big tree.
(Box tomb.). This is the worst case of lichen I have seen it is a very tough
woody type that lives on the stone because of being in the shade of the Oak
Tree.</br>
