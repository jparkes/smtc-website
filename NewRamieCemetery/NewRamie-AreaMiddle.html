This is a view looking southeast. Notice all the box tombs on our right. I had
very little success reading most of them and from the looks of things previous
researchers had the same difficulty because my list and theirs is similar with
the missing box tombs. Only one of them had no inscription at all. The rest
had a very faint inscription or lichen so tough they could not be cleaned enough
to transcribe.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/NewRamieCemetery/Img_7404-1.jpg" width="1521" height="432"></br>
&nbsp;This is a photo looking northwest from the southern middle edge of the
cemetery. The southern fence is behind us This is an extra wide picture made by
combining two photos. </b></font><b>Most
of the old stones in the middle and western areas of the cemetery can be
identified in this photo by their shapes. Use your scroll bars to view the whole scene. </font><i>Photo
