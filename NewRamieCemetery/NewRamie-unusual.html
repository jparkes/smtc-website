This photo shows an unusual situation whereby a large tree has swallowed up a stone.
The stone is nearly covered by the giant Elm tree. I would estimate that at
least 2 feet of the stone is protruding into the tree. That situation is mentioned in 1987 by
Mr. Fred Hawkins when he says a replacement stone for Shadrack Dugger was
propped against a tree and nearly consumed by it.  Actually the stone
is not harmed, but it does not matter anyway as Shadrack and his wife have a new
stone. The other stones around this tree are footstones except for the Cordelia
D. Swiney memorial. Someone removed the footstones from the cemetery
to make the mowing easier. Not a good idea, but then I don't have to mow around
them. [WA 5/16/06] <br/>
