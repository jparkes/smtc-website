which says: Malinda Butler Ingram, died Jan 16, 1850 aged 71 years 1 day. Twin
sister Mary Butler Lamar Brown, buried in New Ramie Cemetery Maury County
Tennessee. This stone also mentions Reuben Ingram, died May 26, 1850 aged 85
years. From this we pick up Mary's maiden name Butler and know she had a twin. I
have that photo in the Elkridge Cemetery if anyone wishes to have a copy. Her
