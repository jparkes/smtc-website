History, By Jill Garrett</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#800080"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">January
8, 1973, would mark another anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans and the end
of our last war with England, I (Jill) spent most of 1973 trying to locate a
picture of a War of 1812 soldier to use for this article. Finally I came up with
two; William Boaz and Allen Richardson, both of whom are buried at New Ramah
churchyard.<o:p>

</font></span></font></p>
<p style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">The
hills and hollows along the Valley Creek Road once rang with the joyous sound of
soul stirring Baptist hymns, but today most people have forgotten that New Ramah
Baptist Church ever flourished. What church? No one remembers it. Only a mound
of brick in an overgrown cemetery (cleaned up now) is all that remains.</font></p>
<p style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">Valley
Creek Road leads from the Pulaski Pike to Culleoka about ten miles south of
Columbia and the cemetery is about ï¿½ mile from the main highway on a hill
across from where Tanyard Hollow Road junctions Valley Creek Road.</font></p>
<p style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">But
there was a church here even though very little has been preserved of its
history. On November 11, 1825 John Cannon deeded land to Isaac Butcher, John
Richardson; Richard Hewett. &quot;Trustees of Baptist Church known as Ramah
adjoining where Cannon lived on Fountain Creek and Elisha Pullen's spring and
including a new brick meeting house known as New Ramah. Witnesses to the deed
were Wiley P. Richardson (also in War of 1812) and Henry B. Cannon.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">The
church name came from the Bible in Joshua XVIII, 25, and also 1st Samuel 1, 19.
Through the years the pronunciation and spelling were corrupted into New Ramia,
New Ramey, and even Neurarmie. In a short biography of William Garrett of
Southport, he is listed as being one of the first members of &quot;the Free Will
Baptist Church at Newrona&quot;. Allen Richardson died in 1865 after serving
over twenty years as minister of New Ramah and it is thought the church went
into decline after his death. The membership was eventually absorbed by
Friendship Church at Culleoka.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-right:-37.8pt"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman" color="#800080">In case you are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Curious,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">New Ramah served the
Stiversville area, which stretches from here to the Giles County line along the
Pike. The community </span>was named for John Stivers who moved on to Giles
County about 1850 after selling his land to Joshiah Allen Dugger.</font></p>

had a wonderful way of captivating her reader's interest with facts and
stories of olden days of Maury County and other Middle Tennessee areas. She is
today a widely read author with several books in print two of which are: &quot;Hither
