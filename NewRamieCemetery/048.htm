PULLEN, Nancy Elizabeth Scott Pullen, 1826 - 1876, &quot;2nd wife of Elisha
Pullen&quot;<a href="mailto:marbles@texoma.net"> </br>


Hello Mary Bob McClain, The correct spelling
should be Nancy Elizabeth Scott Pullen. It is not known where Nancy is buried.
This marker was placed, at New Ramie, about 4 years ago by descendants to honor
Nancy. An error was made in etching the stone. She was born 1826 and died March
1876. Since the placing of this stone, new evidence surfaced that leads us to
think she may be buried near her parents and other family members at Chaffin
Cemetery, Maury Co. info from her gg-granddaughter, Pat Cribbet Sullivan, IL&nbsp;</br>
New stone has inscription error. Given name should be Nancy, not Nacy)</br>
