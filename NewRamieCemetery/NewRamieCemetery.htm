<p><font size="2" color="#000080">Assuming that the Cemetery lies East to West,
when you enter the present gate and slightly to your right on the North side was
the location of the New Ramie Baptist Church according to Virginia Tyree.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">About the middle of the Cemetery and near the
present North fence, there is somewhat a vacant space where Virginia Tyree
pointed out as the burial spot of Alexander/Ann and David/katherine in unmarked
graves. When Jay Dugger, (Tacoma, WA), and I were down there on Friday before
the 2005 Reunion, a half of a large tree had fallen over that spot. I called
attention to that at the Reunion and it has probably been removed by this time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">Incidentally, although the New Ramey Cemetery
Association is a &quot;loose-jointed&quot; volunteer entity, there is a $5,000
CD held by the Association and it continues to grow slightly each year through
volunteer donations at the Reunion. Carl Pigg, 4623 Pulaski Hwy, Culleoka, TN
3845 looks after the maintenance of the Cemetery-voluntarily. He needs to be
thanked for his care for it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">If I'm not mistaken, Donald Scott (Dugger
kin), owns some of the land around the Cemetery having bought it at auction a
few years ago.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">I was told that there is another Dugger
Cemetery down the Valley View Road, (it could be named Richardson). I asked
James Glenn Dugger about this, (I was told that it was on the old Glenn&nbsp;Dugger
property), but he seemed to know nothing about it. I heard that it is
considerably grown up now. (This cemetery may now be lost as I have made no
progress in finding it, WA)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" color="#000080">A few miles south of here just over the Giles
County line a man named Matthews bought the old Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith
house in Waco, Tennessee (interred in the Daniel Cemetery on Mooresville Pike)
and is trying to get it on the National register. Dr. Smith was my gggrandfather
on my mother's side. He (Mr Matthews) wrote me wanting to know any historical
incidents or other interesting facts concerning the house. Unfortunately, I know
only a few facts about the house or Dr. Smith. We do know that he came from
South Carolina, but where, there are no records. The &quot;buck stops with Dr.
Smith!&quot; Martha LeBar wrote me from Pompano Beach, FL, a couple of years ago
saying that she was my cousin. Upon questioning her, I learned that Dr. Smith
was also her gggrandfather through his third marriage. I had always heard that
there were no children born in this marriage but she told me that Dr. Smith was
murdered during the Civil War before&nbsp;she was actually born and while her
mother was pregnant with her. Seems that he was &quot;quite a man&quot; having
been married three times and died at age 51. Story is that he was shot by Yankee
soldiers who were raiding his henhouse at night but my mother told me that she
thought he had been too friendly with some neighbor's wives and that one of them
shot him. Take your choice! [Jack Dugger, Nashville Tennessee, 2007.]</font></p>
