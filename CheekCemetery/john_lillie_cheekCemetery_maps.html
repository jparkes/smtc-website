 Cheek Bend of the Duck River, off Sowell Mill Pike in the Leftwich Community, Maury County Tennessee</b>.</br>
<b>Specific</b><b>
 Location: In the Cheek Bend off Sowell Mill Pike in the Leftwich Community in the Southeastern Portion of Maury County on what was the land of the Cheek family.  Cheek Bend, home of the Cheek and Liggett families for generations, was taken
over by TVA for the never completed, then removed, Columbia Dam.  It was then given to the State of Tennessee.
The area is now managed by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.
Directions: Go east (actually south east)
on Sowell Mill Pike and turn right into Cheek Bend Road. Follow the road back
into Cheek Bend. There is a field road shown on the aerial &amp; topographical
maps included that has a pole gate to negotiate. If you are inclined this could be a good footpath or drive to the cemetery.
The field/chirt
road will continue your trip south but slightly westward for 400 to 500 yards to
the cemetery in the north west area of Cheeks Bend of the Duck River. The
cemetery is in a round shaped stand of trees about 150 feet in diameter
surrounded by a field. If you are allergic to chiggers don't go there in
summertime. Winter time finds chiggers dormant.</br>

<b>This map shows the cemetery pointed out by a
yellow arrow. The map shows the Cheek Bend Road.&nbsp;I have drawn in white what
is </br>
the old road to the cemetery. TVA took the land for the dam, and when not
completed it was given to the state, and is managed by TWRA. The circular part
of the Cheek Bend road is gravel/chert and is reasonably well kept. The road
shown branching off the circular one is blocked by a pole gate but is also
drivable assuming you can get by the pole gate. </b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CheekCemetery/Cheek(JL)CemAerial1.jpg" width="941" height="393"></br>
<b>This map shows the cemetery pointed out by a
