&quot;Mary
J. Childress is not buried in the Mooney-Childress Cemetery in Glendale, TN.
Only her husband is buried where the tombstone sits. She is buried in Perry
Mount Park Cemetery in Pontiac, Michigan. My grandfather, M. R. Childress, and
Mary J.'s son, Hazel Childress had the stone put in the cemetery and just added
her name to it as a memorial. She was living in Pontiac with her son, Hazel and
his wife when she passed away. I do have a copy of her death notice as proof.
Mary J. was my great-great grandmother. </font><font color="#CC3300">Signed:
