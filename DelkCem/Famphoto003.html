A large group of mostly the Kennedy family gathered here in circa 1949. This
photo session arose from a birthday dinner from Sam Kennedy's grandmother. <br/>
This <a href="Famphotonames003.html">Link is to a list of names</a> that I got
Nina Delk to give me after my father's house burned. I (James Delk) gave
Cornealia Lovell a copy and she checked Nina's list with Maude Lovell and they
agreed.<br/>
  The label says 1949. I think it was actually
1948 based on the age of the little girl in Carl Harris, Jr.'s arms (she was
born in 1946)<br/>
