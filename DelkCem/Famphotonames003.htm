FAMILY PHOTOS, KETTLE MILLS, (Western) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</font></b><center><b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/DelkCem/1894SamGillDelkReunion/imgMaBettysnamesNina101.JPG" width="668" height="822"></br>
</font></b></center><b>1949 or 1948 Kettle Mills Reunion</br>
A large group of mostly the Kennedy family gathered here in circa 1949. This
photo session arose from a birthday dinner from Sam Kennedy's grandmother.&nbsp;</br>
The above is a list of names that I (James Delk) got Nina Delk to give me after
my father's house burned. I (James Delk) gave Cornealia Lovell a copy and she
checked Nina's list with Maude Lovell and they agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
The label says 1949. I (James Delk) think it was actually 1948 based on the age
of the little girl in Carl Harris, Jr.'s arms (she was born in 1946)</font></b><i></br>
