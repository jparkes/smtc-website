Columbia go out Williamsport Pike (Hwy 50) just beyond Williamsport turn left
(south) on Greenfield Bend road. Go about 4 miles staying on Greenfield Bend
Rd., and, after you pass the Morrow Rd on your right, turn left (south) onto the
Delk Dr. Road. Almost immediately make another turn left into the 1st farm house
road. This road terminates at the farm house but the Cemetery will be found 200
yards to the right or (Southwest) down the Duck River bank from the house. It
can be seen on the map below in the field just northwest of the Duck
River.Â <br/>

This cemetery is pegged as the streaky
spot upon the ledge of the Duck River Bank. There may be an unimproved road
going by the cemetery as that appears to be the case in the above aerial view.
If there is a clearly marked road publicly marked as serving the cemetery no
advance permission will be required.<br/>
