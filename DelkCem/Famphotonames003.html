A large group of mostly the Kennedy family gathered here in circa 1949. This
photo session arose from a birthday dinner from Sam Kennedy's grandmother. <br/>
The above is a list of names that I (James Delk) got Nina Delk to give me after
my father's house burned. I (James Delk) gave Cornealia Lovell a copy and she
checked Nina's list with Maude Lovell and they agreed.  <br/>
The label says 1949. I (James Delk) think it was actually 1948 based on the age
of the little girl in Carl Harris, Jr.'s arms (she was born in 1946)</b><i><br/>
