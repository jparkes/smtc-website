	<br>
	15 April 2011 to Mary Bob McClain<br>
	I believe this is John M. Judd, not Mc. Judd. I also think you have the 
	wrong side of the Civil War.<br>

	Notes on Sons of Rev. Daniel Judd from: &quot;Report of the Adjutant General of 
	the State of Tennessee of the Military Forces of the State from 1861 to 
	1866&quot; Nashville, Tenn. S. C. Mercer, Printer To The State, 1866, pages

	JADD, John M. - JUDD, John M. - listed on NARA records as of Co. A, 2nd 
	Tennessee Mounted Infantry. Reported on rolls of Co. A, 10 Sep 1864 died; on 
	15 Oct 64 reported died of diphtheria at Nashville. Record of Death and 
	Interment: Grave located No. 9593 Nashville City Cem, resided in Wayne 
	County and was single. Died of Bilious Remittent Fever at 21. Nearest 
	relative Dianna Judd of Waynesboro. Died Oct 15, buried Oct 16 1864. <br>

	JADD, John M. 1st Lieutenant Age 20 &quot; nev must Jd Co as privt Oct 2 63; pro

	Died Oct 15 64 <br>
	<br>
	Rev. Daniel Judd b. 1800 d. 1860, father of Union Soldiers John M. Judd and 
	Daniel W. Judd was from Pa and settled in Wayne Co. Tenn. Wayne Co. was a 
	loyal unionist area. The record above has it spelled Jadd but the mother is 
	listed as Judd. I am not sure when the Judd family moved from Wayne Co. to 
	Maury Co. but sometime prior to the 1850 census. The other children in the 
	1850 census of Rev Daniel and Diana Judd are Nelson P. Judd, Hannah Judd 
	(Galloway mem #31064392) and Johanna <br>

	John M. Judd is shown as the child of Daniel and Dianna Judd in the 1850 
	Maury Co. Census. I believe the stones for the two sons (Daniel and John) 
	who died in the Civil War are near Dianna and Daniel's stones at Pisgah. I 
	am attaching photos of Daniel and Dianna's Stones. I do not have a photo of 
	John Mc. Judd's stone, but I believe the Mc must be an abbreviation for a 
	middle name for it seems unlikely that it is not the son of Daniel, based on 
	the proximity of the stones in the Pisgah grave yard. The other children of 
	Daniel Sr. are Nelson P. Judd and Hannah Judd Galloway. Hannah, who is my 
	ancestor is buried at Kittrell Cemetery in Isom, Maury Co.<br>

	<br>
	Wayne,<br>
	What about this correspondence? I am going to change the Findagrave.com 
	listing to agree with him. They are his ancestors so I will keep the peace 
	with him, not that I agree because I clearly see the Mc on your photo of his 
	tombstone.<br>
	Let me know how you want me to correct the listing on your site.<br>
	Mary Bob<br>
	Well the Mc is not so clear but there is a hyphenated letter either o or c 
	and it is likely it is short for &quot;Mac&quot;, but not McJudd as he thinks we are 
	implying. Also he is likely one of those who started on the C.S.A. and 
	switched during the war to the northern side, so I am not going to change 
	the listing. Mr Elder may be right, but he has not convinced me I am wrong 
	in reflecting the tombstone. CWA 8 May 2012.<br>
