  Joseph Patton enlisted as Second Lieutenant in Capt Adlai Biffle's Company E,
  9th Regiment of Tennessee Cavalry with his brothers, David, Henry, and Mel.
  The company was formed in 1861 at Hampshire and composed mostly of sons of the
  early settlers at Cathy's Creek. Captain Biffle was the grandson of Jacob
  Biffle, a Revolutionary soldier and first cousin of Major James H. Akin, whom
  Biffle succeeded. The battalion was captured at Dover, held six months in
  prison and released. After being released, they went to Mississippi and on to
  Port Hudson, Louisiana. Others, from Hampshire joined them at Port Hudson, the
  trek taking a month on horseback. They remained at Port Hudson until the
  surrender there. Sometime afterward, the battalion was transferred to Dalton,
  Georgia. The Ninth Battalion surrendered at Charlotte, North Carolina, in
  1865.</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Joseph
  Jefferson Patton was taken prisoner at Fort Donelson in February, 1862. Remarkably,
  he was never wounded even though he participated in all of the battles of his
  company. He surrendered at Charlotte , N.C. and he and the others of his
  company began the long journey homeward on horseback, only to have his horse
  taken from him by the Yankees at Strawberry Plains in East Tennessee. This was
  in direct violation of the agreement at the surrender place In Charlotte where
  they were allowed to keep their horses. It is known William Y. Wiley of
  Company B arrived back in Maury County with his horse intact.</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Joseph's
  first wife was named Caroline, born about 1840. Her last name is unknown. She
  died about the time he enlisted.<br/>

	J. J. Patton Gone To His Reward<br/>
	<br/>
	Taps Sounded For Another Old Hero Of The Confederacy - Lieutenant In Civil 
	War - Has Been Confined To Bed Of Affliction Several Months<br/>
	<br/>
	J. J. Patton, another one of the grizzled heroes of the lost cause, has gone 
	hence. After four or five years of suffering and several months confinement 
	to his bed of affliction, the spirit of J. J. Patton took its flight into 
	the great beyond at 3 o'clock this morning. Mr. Patton was a Confederate 
	soldier and fought with courage and valor, being Lieutenant of Co. E 9th 
	Cavalry commanded by Maj. J. H. Akin, who died some months ago. As a citizen 
	Mr. Patton was held in highest esteem by all whose good fortune it was to 
	know him. He was a man of sterling character, fearless in times that test 
	men's courage, a leader of men both in peace and war. <br/>
	He is survived by four children, Messrs Brown, Joe T. and W.S. Patton, and a 
	daughter, Mrs. W. R. Webb. As honorary pall-bearers, a party of old 
	soldiers, eleven of them, member's of Lieut. Patton's old company will 
	officiate. The active pall-bearers are J. T. Akin, Hunter Brooks, W. E. 
	Akin, Sam J. Akin, J. R. Farris and George Patton. <br/>
	The funeral services will be conducted tomorrow at eleven o'clock at 
	Hampshire by Rev. W. T. S. Cooke, and interment will follow at Pisgah. Mr. 
	Patton was born November 2, 1834, died at half past three o'clock September 
	1, 1911, and was therefore 76 years, 9 months, and 29 days old. As 
	illustrating his devotion to ideals and convictions Lieu. Patton treasured a 
	Mexican silver dollar, given him after the evacuation of Richmond by 
	President Jefferson Davis, and this memento of the "Star cradled nation that 
	fell", he had with him when he died.</b><i><b><br/>
