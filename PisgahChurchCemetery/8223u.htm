	Mary Bob,<br>
	<br>
	My sister visited Wayne's Pisgah Church and Cemetery site and noticed a 
	couple of things. His site has a typo on the death date of Sue Edna Bailey 
	Akin--he has 1848; it should be 1948. He also lists several unmarked graves. 
	There is an unmarked grave he doesn't know about. Between the graves of 
	Claiborne L. Bailey and Susan Elizabeth Pogue Bailey and that of Ollie Wayne 
	Akin is the unmarked grave of Gladys Emise Akin, the sister of Ollie Wayne 
	who died in early childhood. At the time of her death, our grandparents did 
	not have the money to get her a stone. Gladys and Ollie Wayne were the 
	sister and brother of our mother, Frances Elizabeth Akin Dedman (buried at 
	Rosehill).<br>
	<br>
	I am copying my sister, Susan Dedman Weis on this in case she has any other 
	information. <br>
	<br>
	I thought John Akin's wife, Mary Watson Howe Akin, was buried near John at 
	Pisgah, but she is not on the list. I may be mistaken about this as she and 
	John were both living in Wayne County at the time of their deaths. She 
	predeceased John. John was brought to Pisgah, and I thought Mary was also. I 
	thought she was buried to the left of John's grave--to the left of the slot 
	where John's original stone stood before collapsing. Again, I am going on 
	long ago information which may be incorrect. Wayne's work is quite thorough.
	<br>
	<br>
	Where you have coverage I find yours and Wayne's work to be more useful than 
	FindAGrave. Thanks for all the hard work. Ancestry.com is riddled with 
	mistakes too. Too many folks going for volume at the expense of accuracy.<br>
	<br>
	The James W. Ridley I was asking about was the son of James Webb Ridley and 
	grandson of James Webb Smith Ridley, and who was the son of James Webb 
	Ridley and Madge Whitney. James Whitney Ridley committed suicide in Columbia 
	in 1929. I have seen references to his being buried at Rosehill, but I can't 
	find any record of that. After her divorce from James Webb Ridley, Madge 
	Whitney Ridley married James Edwin Dedman, brother of Joseph Marcus Dedman. 
	James Edwin and Madge Whitney are buried in Birmingham, AL.<br>
	<br>
	Wayne's area photos of Pisgah are terrific. [Jim Dedman, 24 Jul 2012]<br>
