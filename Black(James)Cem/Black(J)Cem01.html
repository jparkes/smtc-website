The Dr. William Mortimer Black memorial on the left of the tree. Don't know if
he was a medical doctor or a doctor in the education community. There is a hint
in the inscription that he perhaps was mentioned as a member of a faculty. Might
that have been in nearby Jackson College. Who knows, I have seen no record of
that.</br>

</b><b>BLACK, Dr. William Mortimer, 19 Nov 1807 - 15 Apr
1835. &quot;In his death his parents lost an only son,</br>
society one of its most valued members, and the Faculty one of its brightest
ornaments.&quot;&nbsp;<i></br>
This box tomb is fallen and parts are pushed up by the tree
trunk. The large limbs are in danger of falling on the tomb and further crushing
the memorial. The stone carvers signed their names D.C. &amp; S.? C Gillespie at
the bottom of this tomb.</br>
