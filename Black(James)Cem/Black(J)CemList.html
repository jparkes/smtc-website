<p><b>Of the three box tombs listed here in 1962,
by the authors in They Passed This Way only one remains partially standing. One
has fallen and its top slab placed on top of the other and the third has
crumbled or disappeared. One very old oak tree still stands while another has
broken off and fallen in recent years. F.L.H. 16 Feb 1987. 2009:Today only a
lone Oak tree marks the spot at the top of a small hill. There is a crumbling
box tombstone here with parts scattered around.<br/>
<br/>
I did make a <a href="Black(J)Cemslavegraves.html">search of the area for slave
graves</a> but could not tell the difference between an abandoned grave location
and the residual area of a phosphate mining operation without a very intense
research effort. There are many old sections of that land that were strip mined
in that area, and really all over Maury County.<br/>

<p align="center"><b><u>James Black and community
histories<br/>
</u><br/>
James Black was one of the early pioneers
of Maury County and in particular the Carter's Creek Area. He was one of the
original settlers on the tract of land granted to Gen. Daniel Carter,
Revolutionary soldier, by the N. C. government.  He moved to his property
in Maury County in the 1814. There is an early record of him being sequestered
for jury duty and his corresponding complaint that he had not yet been able to
build a dwelling for his family.  In 1830 he built a fine plantation style
home. He was married to his wife Mary in 1843. It is known they were the parents
of several daughters and according to these cemetery records at least one son
William Black who died as a young Doctor.
James Black became prominent in County government and served as the counties
most powerful member of the court for a time. <br/>
He owned the first pleasure carriage in his area. When he drove it to Old Brick
Church or then known as the Bethesda Presbyterian Church it created quite a stir
when the carriage spooked the other member's horses. The church committee soon
drew up a ruling that stated pleasure carriages could not come within 300 feet
of the church building to appease the brethren.<br/>
<br/>
The daughters of James Black had strange names. Barcenia married Levi Ketchem a
brick mason who did work on some of Maury County finest homes. Panthea married James Dew. Almira married Philip B. Johnson. Talithacumi married Harvey
Watterson in 1832. A romantic story is told that young Watterson came to Maury
County to study at nearby Jackson College. Watterson &amp; Ann Sanford the
daughter of James Sanford who was one of the founders and on the board of the
nearby Jackson College became romantically involved. Harvey went to Bedford County to secure his
parents permission to marry Ann, but upon his return he discovered Ann had
married another and moved to Alabama. Ann later died in childbirth during Aug
1833. Harvey meanwhile had met Talithacumi Black and married her in June 1832.
Their son Henry Watterson became the nationally prominent newspaper editor of
the Louisville <i>Courier</i>. Harvey himself became a US Senator for Kentucky after the
family relocated to Louisville.<br/>
Another daughter Mary Almedia Black married Thomas Stanley Matthews at their
home in Maury County in 1843. Stanley Matthews became a U.S. Senator after removing to Ohio.
His speech before the electoral college won Rutherford B. Hayes the Presidency
of the U.S. He was subsequently appointed justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by
President Hayes. Stanley &amp; Mary A. Matthews had ten children. One son Paul
married Elise Proctor, whose grandfather and great uncle James Gamble were the
business partners after the namesake Proctor &amp; Gamble,  a large US company
still active today in the household products market. The final daughter
that I know of was Theresa Jane Black who lies in this
cemetery beside her only brother and parents.<br/>
<br/>
<u>KLEBURNE</u> - The little extinct Village of Kleburn sprung up near the rails
years later. It was very near the old home of James Black.  When the railroad
line was built through Maury County, many small stations were built for the convenience
of the passengers or for the use of the railroad line itself. One of these was
named for Gen. Patrick Cleburne,
one of the Confederate officers killed in the Battle of Franklin a few miles
north of here. The name was
spelled Kleburne in order to facilitate the work of the telegraphers. This
station today was immediately behind the site of the main buildings of the Saturn
Corporation's Spring Hill Plant and just north east of the site where the
plantation home of James Black stood. The James Black home was  destroyed in 1963 by a
Tornado during the night. The James Black home, then
known as the Walton Home, was swept away one midnight on January 10, 1963 by a
vicious Tornado. The triple brick walls were revealed along with other evidences
of a home well built. James Black died in 1849 and his wife and at least two of
his children are buried or at least it is known they are interred in this cemetery revealed
on this site. Today we find no monuments for James nor his wife Mary. <br/>
<br/>
BLACK, JAMES. Little is recorded about this pioneer in the Carter's Creek area.
He was one of the original settlers on the tract of land granted to Gen. Daniel
Carter, Revolutionary soldier, by the N. C. government. Others who settled on
this 5,000 acre tract were: Robert Campbell, Seth Gordon, W. Witherspoon, Frank,
Jackson and Armstead Polk, and many others. Carters Creek Station was an area of first quality soil
and by 1850 had extensive cotton plantations. A gin and general store were
established in the neighborhood and when the railroad was built from Nashville
to Columbia, they built a station here. Other businesses were added and
Carter's Creek Station was an important community for many years. After the
Civil War, however, it gradually experienced decline. Cotton production and
prices fell. <br/>
One by one the businesses closed, the railroad closed its station, the gin
ceased to function but it was not until<br/>
the 1970's that the final general store closed its doors. Several of the
buildings still stand (1980), some being used as residences, but, as a village,
Carter's Creek Station is no more.(2009). However the name remains on several
landmarks such as the Columbia to the north pike named Carter's Creek Pike and
other reminders of the Revolutionary Soldier Daniel Carter.</b></p>
