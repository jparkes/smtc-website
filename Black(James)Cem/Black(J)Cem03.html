This crumbling peice of stone has evidences that it was at one time a carved
stone. It is shaling and crumbling into dust today. I noticed there may be
others like this around the graveyard. These limestone memorials are not lasting
longer than about one to two hundred years. <br/>
Located to the north of the William M. Black memorial.</b><b><i><br/>

In this photo north of the Tree (or William B. Black memorial) we see a sunken
grave, though it is hard to make out in this photo. It is possible the memorial
has fallen into the pit and sunken below the ground in cases like this. I did
not explore this with a probe that day. <i><br/>
