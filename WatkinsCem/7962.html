The three stones seen
here are for the Patterson family. The smaller stone in front is the footstone
for William H. Patterson. The stone in the center is the headstone for William
and the stone in back is the headstone for Joseph Patterson. <br/>
This location is just north or to the viewers right of the other inscribed
memorials in this cemetery. There is a large area to our right that may contain
unmarked graves, but I saw few if any fieldstones. <br/>

Here we see the memorial of three year old William H. Patterson who died in
1836. The green "Bear Grass" also called Texas grass shown on our
right side of the tombstone probably has a history of its own. It can live into
the hundreds of years. It is possible that it was planted here by the Patterson
family after the death of this child in 1836 and has thrived that long or 2008 -
1836 = 172 years. You see this plant marking old home sites where there are no
longer any buildings standing. Interesting study would be to see if one can
figure a way to date the plant by studying its composition. Unlike most other
plants it hardly grows at all over time.</b></p><center><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><br/>
