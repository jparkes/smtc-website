</b><b>The
GPS Coordinates for the Wells Cemetery shown above are incorrect. This is the
coordinates for the Watkins (Benjamin) Cemetery.&nbsp; That means the Wells Map
is dislocated by the all the GPS companies today. </b><b>This map labeled Wells Cemetery comes to us from Topozone and is part of an
effort by the large modern GPS mapping companies to place all the
cemeteries in the country on locator maps. Each cemetery has a Longitude and
Latitude also known as the GPS coordinates. This placement is in error because
this spot on the map is actually the Benjamin Watkins Cemetery. The Wells Cemetery lies on the area of this map, but
due east 1/2 mile across both feeder branches to Rutherford Creek. It is not marked on this or any other maps I am aware of except
for Fred Hawkins Map in the book Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries. Fred Hawkins
documented the
Wells Cemetery, but omitted the Watkins Cemetery. Same for researchers
before him. All researchers say the Wells Cemetery is behind
the barn of descendent John Wells on the back side of his place. There are no modern maps showing a barn
in this highly developed area. There are only houses and shopping malls.</br>

</b><b>This aerial
map shows the Watkins Cemetery pointed out by a yellow arrow in a clump of trees. It is
adjacent to the newly laid out Ray Williams Drive and contains no houses as of
this writing but the street contains curbs and pavement. Actually the street
extends beyond the place above into the next areas to the southwest of this
newly laid out area.&nbsp;</b></br>
