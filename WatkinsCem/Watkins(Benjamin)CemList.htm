(Benjamin) CEMETERY,&nbsp;(Ray Williams Dr., Spring Hill), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</b>
From Saturn Parkway exit north (or left going east) on Port Royal Road. Follow
that about a mile or so north until it bends west (or left 90�) and continue to follow that until
it bends another 90� back north. Don't take the northward turn but go (or
continue) straight west into Commonwealth Drive. Follow Commonwealth Dr. about
two football field
lengths or to the first left turn into Ray Williams Dr.&nbsp; Follow Ray
Williams Drive 3 tenths of a mile or about 600 yards and the cemetery should be
on your right next to the road under a cluster of tall trees.&nbsp; It is about
25 yards west from the center of the road to the center of the cemetery. You are
in the center of an active house building project so if you come here in the future you might
find yourself in a busy neighborhood with houses all around the cemetery.
Hopefully the cemetery will get good neighbors who will watch after it instead
of destroy it.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#008000"><a href="WatkinsCemMaps.htm"><br>

<u>Commentary condition:</u><br>
It is no wonder this little
family cemetery was never found by previous county-wide researchers. Until in
recent times it was about a mile from the nearest road back into the thickets. Miraculously
the construction crew found it before setting the bull dozers in force. It was
well marked on Topographical Maps, but was not named. I am adding the name
Watkins Cemetery on it because the predominate &amp; oldest surname
found here is Watkins thus the: Watkins (Benjamin) Cemetery. If anyone can
dispute this name let me hear from you.&nbsp;<br>
<u>Incorrect Mapping</u><br>
In recent times with the emergence of large GPS road mapping
companies such as Delorme, Microsoft Streets &amp; others one of these companies
assigned the name Wells Cemetery onto this graveyard and mapped it as such. It is marked incorrectly Wells Cemetery on about all modern road maps that
show small cemeteries. The true location of the Wells (Thomas) Cemetery is about
1/2 mile due east of this place, and south and west of the extended Port Royal Road.&nbsp;<br>
