This land was originally owned by my Great-great-great grandparents Armistead
and Mary “Polly” Paxton Redding who migrated from Woodford or Fayette
County, KY, settling in Maury County around 1808 or so. My grandfather had the
original land grant at one time but it disappeared around the time of his death.
The Tommy Brown family owned the old Redding homestead a few years back when I
visited and took the attached pictures. There are several graves there but only
one true gravestone, that of my great-great grandmother Mary A. (Montgomery)
Redding. The story goes that she fell off of her horse while crossing a
rain-swollen stream. Her dress was weighted with lead weights to make the dress
stay down as it was meant to be worn. As a result, she drowned. Presumably,
Armistead and Polly Paxton Redding (original Redding progenitors) are also
buried there as are probably some of their children. However, there are only
small gray field stones with no inscription marking those graves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>
John L. Redding who was married to Mary Redding who is buried in the Redding
cemetery is better known as “Jack” Redding. Pa (John Leonard Redding) always
referred to him as “Jack Lester.” I have a transcription of Thomas White’s
diary from the 1870’s and Thomas White refers to him as “Jack.” Thomas
White was a prominent member of the community and was married to a relative of
mine on the Campbell side. There are many Campbells buried in Shane Cemetery,
including Ann (Campbell) Graves-- my Great-G-G-G grandmother. Thomas White
married the niece (Caroline Amy Campbell) of Ann Campbell Graves. [Jerry R. Witt
