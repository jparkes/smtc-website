Go south out of Culleoka on Graham Road. After a mile or so the road makes a
sharp turn to the left. The cemetery is behind a private house (on the north 
side of the road. The place is/was
owned
by Tommy Brown. This is near the railroad. See the map below I now know the 
above map showing the Redding Cemetery on the south side of the road is not 
correct.</font><br>

</font><b><font color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The actual GPS 
coordinates of this cemetery are: North 35.45926 X&nbsp; West 86.98415. Most 
maps have a Redding Cemetery pegged about a mile north of here. I have never 
heard of another Redding Cemetery so my conclusion is the national mapping is 
incorrect, which means the USGS &amp; Google mapping has it wrong.<br>
Locatin: 1.4 miles S of Culleoka TN, 5.8 mi NxNE of Lynnville TN, 10.6 mi NW of 
Cornersville TN, 11.0 mi W of Lewisburg TN &amp; about 8 miles southeast of Columbia 
Tennessee.<br>
