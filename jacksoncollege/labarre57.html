COLLEGE/OLD BRICK CEMETERY-MAURY COUNTY, SPRING HILL TENNESSEE</font></b><center><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jacksoncollege/img_2018.jpg" width="576" height="765"></center>

(31-5-0).
&nbsp;Consort of Rev. Labarre, Pres. of Jackson College. </br>
</font><i>Sacred to the
memory of Eliza P. Laberre,
Consort of Rev. B. Laberre Pres. of Jackson Coll. Born in Stoughton Mass
May 5, 1804 died 
Oct 12 1835 aged 31 yrs 5 mo. She adorned the Christian character in life and
died in the
triumphs of faith Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.</i></font>
</br>
</font>Since Eliza
died at the age of thirty
one it is likely her husband remarried. It is also likely he moved away since he
nor any other persons 
with the surname Laberre is interred here. The</font> <a href="labarre57-1.html">Jackson College President's Home </a>
was
still standing in recent times. </font> </br>
</font>It is believed the old Cumberland Presbyterian Church was located back in the
green field to the rear of this photo. There is a very touching Civil War story
concerning one of the sons of Mrs. Laberre who fought on the northern side that
is very moving. It is mentioned in Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, but told
originally in the book Century Review of Maury County TN. </font> <i>
</br>
These books are
still in print and can be readily obtained on the Maury County Historical
Society 
Web page.</br>
