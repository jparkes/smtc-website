THE FINAL SUMMONS<br>
<br>
After a lingering illness, Mrs. Nora Thompson, of Spring Hill, died late Tuesday 
afternoon at her home. Mrs. Thompson had been a patient sufferer from cancer for 
several months, and her death, though expected, came as a shock to her host of 
friends. She is survived by eight children, Mayes, Sinclair, Leo and Fred 
Thompson, and Misses Minnie and Susie Thompson, Mrs. Polk [sic, Pope] McKissick 
and Mrs. Douglas Martin. She had two sisters, Mrs. T. N. Figuera, Sr., and Mrs. 
J. M. Mayes, both of Columbia. She had two brothers who survive her, John and 
Henry Cheairs, of Spring Hill. Mrs. Thompson was a sister of the late Ben 
Cheairs, who was formerly sheriff of this county.<br>
<br>
The funeral was held at the old Thompson burying ground at Brick church at three 
o'clock Wednesday afternoon, the funeral being preached by Rev. P. L. Bruce, 
pastor of the Presbyterian church at Spring Hill. Mrs. Thompson was for years a 
consistent member of the Presbyterian church. She was a woman of strong 
character, a consecrated Christian and true to every obligation of life. <br>
