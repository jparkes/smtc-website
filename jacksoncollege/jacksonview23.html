view looking into the newer section of the cemetery with results of hard work
beginning to show up. Many tombs have been rediscovered and uncovered and some
have been set up. That is Mr. Jack Taylor taking a break from the difficult task
of a long Saturday. Saturday 11-8-2003 was very fruitful for the restoration.
There were three more box tombs uncovered and photographed. The restoration of
the Odil family memorial (where 10 members of the family died from an infectious
disease was set up and plans made to finish repair of the fracture
at the base. </b></center>
