A
view looking southeast from the west side of the Jackson College
Cemetery at the third row of memorials. This is a view of some of the most
beautiful memorials found anywhere in the Maury County Cemeteries. Those who
erected them in memory of their loved ones obviously were showing their
affection to the deceased. The first stone on the left belongs to Harriet
Fleming consort of Dr. John T. Fleming. Deceased at 21 Harriet was the young
bride of John T. Fleming. You can see John spent lavishly to express his
youthful love for his deceased bride. The next stone belongs to Dr. John Haddox,
following that is the stone of Mary L. Haddox the 2nd wife of Dr. John. Next
will be the memorial to Susan Haddox the 1st wife of Dr John and daughter of
notable Col. James T. Sandford whose box tomb along with other members of the
family is just behind these stones. <i>Photo by WA. 10/11/20003.&nbsp;<a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.htm"></br>
