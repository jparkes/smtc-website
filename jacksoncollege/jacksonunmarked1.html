Shown
here is a broken box tomb that has an unknown inscription due to being broken. The top
that normally contains the lettering is shattered, buried or scattered. The
sides and ends are mostly fallen and buried. You may be wondering what force
could have caused such a jumbled up mess out of what was once a beautiful nine
part tomb assembly. Only two parts of the many fractured pieces of the top shown
in the left middle of the photo could be readily found. This tomb has something
in the range of one ton of solid granite that has parts that weigh upward to 800
lbs. That much damage could have only come from a large falling tree because the
top is practically crushed. Another possible cause of the destruction is rooting
hogs. They just might have the kind of strength to do this much damage.&nbsp; If
this was caused by a fallen tree it has long since decayed leaving no evidence
of the usual ground cavity from decaying roots. I for one just do not
believe teenage vandals could have caused this much damage in spite of the many
stories I hear.&nbsp;</br>
There is a voluntary restoration team at work developing ways to repair
this tomb and others here. The ground will be raked and probed for the missing
parts of the top and the other parts such as the ends and sides and corners that
appear to me to be there will be set up, stabilized and leveled. These must be located and reassembled for the inscription to be
recovered. The top (parts) can then be bonded with the latest techniques. This is one of the most difficult restoration challenges one can
tackle.&nbsp;</br>
 Located to your right at the bottom is also a fallen foot marker (with the
arrow-point shape) that belongs
to an infant's grave next to this one. In the upper left area of the photo is the fallen tower
sections of the Thompson Memorials. These do not belong to this box tomb
assembly.<i>Photo and writings by Wayne Austin
