This is the only known picture of the first Presbyterian Church built in Middle
Tennessee south of Nashville, Tennessee. It was at one time located on the
property of Nathan Cheairs in sight of a (Manual Labor Academy) college built by
the early Settlers who came to the land about two miles south of Spring Hill,
Tennessee. The church was located near the Absolom Thompson Plantation, west and
on the south side of the road in what is now an open field. It is believed that
it backed up to a bluff on Rutherford Creek in the back and to the front was the
old historic cemetery that served its members along with the college as their
are students &amp; faculty interred there. The site is now largely
un-recognizable except for scattered brick and the cemetery. The first recorded
stone in the cemetery was of a man named James Kerr (died 1818, came to this
place in 1807) It is believed Kerr played a part in founding the above church by all his
descendents that know the character and nature of this family, but the historical records I
have seen do not mention him.&nbsp;<br>
It is not known when the above brick building was constructed. The bricks
are slave made of locally obtained fire clay. The church was used for worship by both slave and plantation owner. This
painting was done by Myra Thompson, maiden aunt of Myra Thompson McKissack. Myra was the daughter of Absolom Thompson.
This painting was given to the Carl E. Kinnard in May of 1958. It
hangs in the Rippavilla Plantation home open to the public for tours near the
Saturn Plant.&nbsp;<br>

BETHESDA PRESBYTERIAN

Meetinghouse or Old Brick Church) This Church was located at&nbsp; one time “on the
bluffs above Rutherford’s Creek” about 1 mile south of Spring Hill Tennessee
off of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;what is today </span>Brown Road about a half
mile. This location is now so far off the beaten path of Spring Hill and the nearby giant
Automobile industry that few persons today are aware of this old extinct but
historic church, school
and remaining Cemetery site.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first concrete evidence of
the Church Existence occurred when Ezekiel Polk the grandfather of our 11<sup>th</sup>
 US President James Knox Polk deeded five acres of land on June 15, 1811 to John
Johnson, David Lucky and Robert Campbell who were the trustees of Bethesda
Church. The word Bethesda is an old Bible term meaning place of comfort for the
sick and lame and the name arose out of the hardships of the early settlers. There was a meeting house already in use by the devout old-school
Presbyterians in North Maury County. Since the founding date was only four years after Maury
County was formed the earlier movement was likely started while that region was
still a part of
Williamson County.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bethesda
Presbyterian Church was located less
than five hundred yards to the east from the school that was to become the Manual Labor Academy.
We
know this school was also deeply integrated into the Presbyterian faith with many of
the students attending both the school &amp; the church.&nbsp; Later the School would become Jackson
College and and eventually move into Columbia and have in attendance as many as 300 students. The School was
established by Dr. Robert Hardin, Presbyterian Minister and Professors William
Williford and Benjamin Larabee in 1820. On November 30, 1830, Colonel James T.
Sanford a former War of 1812 soldier deeded eleven and three fourths acres of land near his home for the
site of the school. James was also one of the Trustees.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This area was sparsely populated in 1806 when James O. Cooke wrote that
there was scarcely a person to be found here. One prominent and previously
mentioned Presbyterian who
came here was James Sanford. He qualified as Justice of the Peace of the county
in Sept of 1809. He served as county court chairman for several years and was
born in 1770 and died in 1830.&nbsp; Sanford was
one of&nbsp; founders of the Manual Labor Academy. This school was the
forerunner of Jackson College. He is buried in the Church Cemetery under a large
box tomb with much written about this on his tombstone. He was referred to as Colonel Sanford by those who addressed him.
It is a title that cannot be
disputed by the written records though it could be a part of his name. He was known to have the rank of Captain while
serving in the War of 1812.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Robert Campbell Family was another who came here early. They were in
the county during 1811 when church property was deeded as mentioned below to Robert (b. 1776 d. 1840)
as one of the three Founders of this Church. He, his wife Martha and some of the members of his family
are interred in the Church Graveyard under what is today a stand of Maple Trees.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
family that came here early on was the James Kerr (b. 1854, d. 1818) Family. The
Kerrs
were also devout Presbyterians setting foot on this land in 1807 from Orange County North
Carolina. Though we have little records denoting their role the Kerrs' were no doubt a part of the first families to begin meeting as a
Presbyterian Church for we know they brought the religion with them from North
Carolina. A grandson of James Kerr had this to say about James in a letter
written to a Texas relative about family history matters: <i>&quot;Grandfather
(James Kerr) died about the year 1817 in this County near where he first settled
in Spring Hill. His religion was old Presbyterian he was a leading member in
that Church. I remember hearing him sing, pray and exhort at the meetings. When
I was small I thought he was a preacher. I can remember hearing him sing and
shout in the field while following his plow. He cared but little for the things
of this world, a competency was all he desired.&quot;</i>&nbsp; James Kerr is buried in the
Church Graveyard nearby under an inscribed stone, under the earliest stone found
to be inscribed.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other early families involved in this Church and possibly the school were the
Stephensons', Johnsons', Browns', Thompsons', Hollands', Greenfields', Mitchells',
McKissicks', Odils', Blackburns' and others that I am not aware of. We know
there was a connection to the Greenfield Bend Presbyterian Church because one of
the daughters of Colonel James T. Sanford married Dr. G.T. Greenfield a
prominently educated doctor of the early county. Also F. A. Thompson one of the
sons of this church preached here and also at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church
(later known as REESEs Chapel).</b></font></p>

The people here were prominent and walked the same paths as powerful
politicians. They were also distinguished Church leaders and ranking members of the
armed services. The Reverends Frederick A. Thompson and Duncan Brown went into the ministry from
this church. Other notable persons who attended the Church and/or school included
Neil S. &amp; John C. Brown, nephews of Col. Hugh Brown, both of whom became
Governors of Tennessee; Harvey M. Watterson, State Legislator and renown editor
in Louisville, Kentucky. Ministers known to have received an education here were
the Reverend George W. Mitchell, George Crowford Stockard, and Samuel A. Nelson.</b></font></p>

Hill Presbyterian Churches grew out of this old Church. After their firm
establishment and the moving of Jackson College into Columbia in 1836, some
decline took place. However the church and school continued to be
attended and the influence would continue for some time. A
school named Union Seminary was formed in 1840 and operated on the site of what
was Jackson College.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not known when services were discontinued at Bethesda, but on
February 15, 1878 the property had reverted to Polk heirs when Mrs. Annie M.
Phillips who was then of Memphis, great granddaughter of Ezekiel Polk signed a
quit claim to the church and cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth in
the importance of the rails located to
the west of here accelerated the decline of this neighborhood and caused it to
be off the beaten path. This along with the decline in the use of the Old Davis Ford
Road one of the early traveled north south routes of the county contributed to the eventual falling away. The centers of commerce were developing more toward the central part of
the county in Columbia and north to Spring Hill and west of here near the
Decatur and Nashville Rail lines.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myra Thompson (daughter of Dr.
Frederick) painted the only image known of the church about 1888. If one can take a stroll through<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the Jackson College/Old Brick Church Cemetery
an occasional brick will be
noticed that was once was a part of the Church building located 200 yards to the east
on the bluff. The old school also of brick was located further to the west on a knoll where
the University of Tennessee Agricultural Center has as of 2003 a livestock
corral.&nbsp;These Church people were proud of the fact that they had a brick church to
attend and thus the name Brick Church was later used. The Church was also known as
Sanford's Meeting House named after James Sanford mentioned above.&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>From the old tomb stone
records in this cemetery we know that Robert Campbell one of the three original
founders remained active in this congregation until his death in 1847. No
tombstone records are found there for the two other founding members. There are
burials of the Administration and Trustees of the Schools there such as for a wife of Dr.
Benjamin Larabee who was Eliza P. Larabee. She died in 1835 at the age of 31 years.
We do not have any information about the whereabouts of Dr. Larabee after this but it is likely he
moved on and possibly remarried. We know from her tombstone inscription that Eliza P. was from Stoughton
Massachusetts.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One feature
that made the site attractive for early settlers to develope was a nearby spring which yielded
an abundance of fresh water for the school and church. In recent years that was
dammed up to form a lake for the University of Tennessee Agriculture Center. The spring was
located between the Church to the east, the cemetery in the middle but closer to
the church and the School to the west.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This author
has not researched the subject but some believe that Black families took up
worship in the abandoned church building for a while after services were
discontinued. The only corroborating evidence of this is a few unmarked graves
on the back side of the cemetery which often were for Black family members.</b></font></p>

The church is believe to have been torn down around 1890.
A few scattered brick remain to mark the spot. Its location was high upon the
bluff overlooking the Rutherford Creek. Just to the west of that in the
year 2003 is an old abandoned farm house in a serious state of decline, but
there are no roads back to this place except field roads.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Jackson College/Old brick
Church Cemetery
established for the worshippers of the Bethesda Church the earliest grave is
1818 that being for the above mentioned James Kerr. However, there are plenty of indications of earlier graves. One is a small
hand
inscribed stone with the name S. C. Kerr scrolled on it. The death date is not
very clear but is believed to be 1817. There are other graves marked with
common fieldstones which often predate the commercial efforts around 1815 which
supplied the county with an abundance of tombstone markers for
use by the early
settlers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cemetery on the
premises today is the most prominent reminder of the past and contains some of
the most elegant monuments to be found anywhere.&nbsp; These are vivid
reminders memorializing those that worshipped at the Bethesda Church and attended or were a part of the administration of the old school here. One such
stone was of a student by the name of James H. Abbott and reads: &quot;Sacred to
the memory of James H. Abbott who was born in Andover Mass. Sept 11th 1812 and
died at Jackson College Oct. 28th 1835, Aged 23. A pious friend, a brother dear, And beloved child is buried here.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cemetery has long since reverted back to nature except for
the occasional efforts by various
concerned descendents, interested citizens, and historical organizations.&nbsp; So large looms the task that it now only seems to
receive the benefit of an occasional surge in
interest at restoration of its
massive monuments and grounds. The restorers quickly realize it is an ongoing struggle
that always seems to fall short of manpower and funds to maintain this
massive cemetery in need of constant repair. The surge in interested is usually triggered by a concerned
descendent who garners the attention of one of the Historical Societies
who then gets attention from the media. This causes a minor swarm of temporarily
concerned citizens and others to visit the area and began to make plans only to be pummeled
by the remoteness, monumental task and inhospitable area.&nbsp; A visit there is almost like visiting
the site of a prominent lost civilization.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The descendents and other history
buffs continue to yearn for the day when the glory of this beautiful church cemetery with
its monuments to the past are standing upright again. Hopeful that they will one day
again deflect the evening sun with a glimmering reminder of the
forebears that came to pass at the Bethesda Presbyterian Church and
the nearby Jackson College. Remembrances of those who have gone the way of lost
civilizations but live on as part of our rich heritage.</b></font></p>
