view looking southwest from a slightly different angle than the previous photo.
The block shaped stone in the mid right of the photo is actually the base of a
stone with no evidence of the main part of the stone around. That is Lost
history folks. It is possible that the stone toppled into the grave and sunk
below the surface due to the grave site being composed of softer soil than that
which normally surrounds the grave. In that case it could be found. It must be said that the tall
stones of the </b></center>
<p align="center"><b>style
mostly used in our near view is the most prone to falling since the base needs
to remain level for them to continue to stand. As one looks over the bases you
will notice not one sets strait and square. Though I have heard of tales
of vandals in this cemetery the evidence in this photo suggest that tree roots and soft soil
were the cause of the bases tilting. However it might have been a Tornado since
all the stones are toppled to the east from the west. This toppling of the
memorials might also have been aided by falling limbs or livestock bumping into
the stones. As previously mentioned the fencing suggest farm animals played a
role. <i>Photo &amp; info by WA. 10/11/20003. <a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.html"><br/>
