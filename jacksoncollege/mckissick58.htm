<b><font color="#800000"  size="2">McKISSICK, John W.,
&quot;Died Sept. 12, 1867 Aged about 50 yrs.&quot; The spelling is slightly
different with an &quot;a&quot; where the last &quot;i&quot; is located, but the
McKissick family was a very wealthy and prominent people being married to or
starting some of the beautiful old plantation homes around Spring Hill. I am not
at this point aware of how they are related to this John if at all.&nbsp;<br>
This is the mid section of a three part memorial that is toppled. We recovered
the mid section from deep into the ground. Actually the mid section with the
inscription should be
mounted on the base which sits behind this. It is not clear how this piece got so deeply embedded
into the ground unless it fell into the grave site composed of softer soil and
sunk over the years. <i>Photo &amp; info by
Wayne Austin 10-11-03. Hopefully a team of restorers will reset this memorial after
the dying Cedar tree is cut that causes the base to lean. Not listed in MCTC nor TPTW.</i></font></p>
