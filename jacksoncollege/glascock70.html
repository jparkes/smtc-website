GLASCOCK, Mary Ann, Infant Daughter of Dr. Wm and Ann (Sandford) Glascock, Departed this
life in July 1832.&nbsp;&quot;DEPARTED THIS Life in July 1832, Mary Ann, Infant Daughter of Dr. Wm. and
Ann Glascock.&quot; This fallen and buried box tomb top is in between the
Sandford Box tombs. Ann was a daughter of Colonel James Turner Sandford. Glascock does not appear on any other known marked stone in
this cemetery. So this may be an indication the Glascocks' were passing through.
They Passed This Way mentions that Ann died in Madison County AL in 1832. Her
grave cannot be found in this cemetery as far as I know. <i>Photo &amp; info by
Wayne Austin 11-08-03. Not listed in MCTC due to being buried underground at the time.
The bottom photo above was made after Wayne Austin restored the tomb 11-28-03,
but before it was cleaned. Was listed in &quot;They Passed this Way&quot; which
was listed in 1962 .</i></font></p>
