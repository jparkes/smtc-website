Here are four little uninscribed stones that probably represent the markers for
four small children. They are located in the Dunlap, Caskey &amp; Stephenson
area of the cemetery. However, we have no evidence they belong to children of
those families. Since the difficult process of birth caused as much death in the
1800s there was often a designated area in the cemetery set aside by several of
the families where the children were laid to rest. <i>Photo by Wayne Austin. 10/27/20003.&nbsp;<a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.htm"></br>
