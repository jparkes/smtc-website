<pre align="center"><font color="#660033" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">KERR, James, born circa 15 Jul 1754 in Pennsylvania and died 6 Mar 1818. Buried at the historic Jackson College Cemetery in Spring Hill his inscription reads: &quot;To the memory of James Kerr Who departed this 
life March 6, 1818. Aged 63 years 7 ms &amp; 18 days.&quot;  It is not known if James' wife Nancy Mitchell Kerr is buried here beside her husband. Many of James' sons moved on south of the Duck River and settled around what is now 
Culleoka Tennessee about 20 miles south of this Cemetery. James has the distinction of having the first marked grave here. Information and the above photo (was first taken in 1990) and is provided by Wayne Austin a descendent 
and the author of this site. 

</font><font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It is thought  by family historian Joe Frank Kerr researching in the early 1900s and Raymond Kerr Evans in the 1960s that James was a Revolutionary War soldier. 
He certainly is the right age being born in 1754 puts him in his twenties  when the war started. According to these family history sources, mainly Joe Frank Kerr, he had two brothers William &amp; John that died in the Revolution 
whereas James survived. [CWA 12 Nov 2011]
