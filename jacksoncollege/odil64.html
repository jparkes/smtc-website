</font>The John Odil family
memorial features the inscription of ten members of the John Odil family who
departed this life beginning in 1843 and then son William died in 1845 and then 
the other eight died during 1853 or 1854. This
is an updated photo of the stone on 29 Nov 2005 after a clamp to secure the
stone was put in place. To make this a finished restoration the pieces should be
bonded and the gaps filled with an approved mix.</font></br>

<b>ODIL, John, 1 May 1786 -
5 Sep 1843. Husband of Mary Kerr. Mary was the daughter of James &amp; Nancy
Mitchell Kerr who are also interred&nbsp; in this cemetery. The death date above is very clearly 1843 and not 1815 as reported
by previous Maury County Researchers. Further evidence of the death date is the
children on this stone were probably the issues of John &amp; Mary Kerr Odil, but were all born
after 1815. <i>Photo &amp; info by

Composite image of four sides of the stone.</br>
&nbsp;This stone represents history revealed possibly for the first time since the
historians began to keep serious records of the Maury County Cemeteries. We
know the memorial stood gracefully in the cemetery at one time. It contains the names of 10
members of the John &amp; Mary (Kerr) Odil family who died probably from Cholera or
Typhoid Fever two of the
dreaded infectious diseases of the times. Page 209 of the book &quot;Hither
&amp; Yon&quot; Jill Garret states: &quot;In the summer of 1853 Mrs. Mary Kerr
Odil of Spring Hill lost eleven of her thirteen children to Typhoid Fever.&quot;
The evidence on this stone cannot refute that statement even though there are
not eleven deaths listed in 1853. The death dates are spread out from 1845 to
1854 with six of them passing in the summer of 1853. There are unmarked stones near this tombstone that could serve as a
marker for the remains of the missing inscriptions to form the eleven Jill and
her sources speak of. Whatever the perfect details this is the stark reality of
the infectious diseases that spread unchecked in the population in the 1800s. Cause of death
also listed in the Kerr History
Project by Frank Kerr McDaniels of California who stated the cause of death as
Cholera. This monument is broken into at least four pieces but contains multiple
inscriptions on three sides and the paternal father John listed on the front
(east) side. It was unearthed on 8 Nov 02003 by a team of civic minded persons that set
it up for a future restoration. It is safely secured for the time being by the
strapping and later a 14&quot; steel clamp.<i> Photo &amp; info by
