<b>THOMPSON, Mrs. M., 4 Feb
1804 - 13 Sep 1869.�Wife of Absalom.". Mrs M. married Absalon sometime
after the death of Absalom's first wife Mary B.. It is unlikely that Mrs M. and
Absalom had any children from their marriage due to Mrs. M.s age.  Plundered and fallen stones are all
around you in this cemetery. It will take a good cleaning to determine which
stones are the bases and which are the tops to fit the bases. Some information
is in danger of being lost. It will be hard to determine which direction many of
the monuments were facing after being put back in a standing position. <i>Photo &amp; info by
