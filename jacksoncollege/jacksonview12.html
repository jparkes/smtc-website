A
view looking north from the south west corner of the Jackson College
Cemetery at the first
three rows of memorials and dense brush of this cemetery even after a days
effort at clearing it. Most of the stones from this view are actually just the
bases of sometimes very large and imposing monuments. This is because most of
the stones are toppled from vandals and years of neglect. Since this photo was
taken I understand the brush has been reduced to a level compatible with a well
cared for cemetery by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Boy Scouts of America. Many thanks are in order
to them.  <i>Photo by WA. 10/11/20003. <br/>
