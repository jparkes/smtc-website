<pre align="center"><b>KENNEDY, John was born 1774 in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and died 
October 16, 1858. He is buried at the historic Jackson College Cemetery in Spring Hill. He was one 
of the signers of the petition to form Maury County. Inscription reads: "<i>In Memory of John Kennedy Who Died 
Oct 16th, 1854. Though Four Score Years <u>H</u>as Past An<u>n</u> Four Years Added Too Time Alone Has Swept At Last 
An Age That Is Obtained By Few.</i>" The first effort to photograph this stone found the tombstone laying on the 
ground when Wanda Kilgore first photographed it in 1992. No one has been able to get back in to check on the 
tombstone in quite sometime. <i>Photo was first taken about 1992 by Rick's cousin Wanda Kilgore and donated by Rick Gray, 
1/8/02003</i>. <i>The above photo was taken and sent for inclusion on this site in May of 2003 by Rick Gray. The stone 
was set up in Dec 2003.</i>
