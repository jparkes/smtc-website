<b>THOMPSON, Captain
Absalom, 22 Aug 1800 - 17 Feb 1881. Absalom and Mary B. Sandford Thompson lived
in (and I believe he built it) the antebellum known now (2003) as the Oak Lawn
home. It is about 1 mile northwest of this stone and I believe is privately
owned by public spirited owners. You may read the history of Oak Lawn on the
Historic Maury Web site at: <a href="http://maurywebpages.com/mchs/">Historic
Maury County</a>.Â  After clicking on this icon use the scroll bar on your
left to scroll and select Historic Homes and Oak Lawn is #7. <i>Photo &amp; info by
