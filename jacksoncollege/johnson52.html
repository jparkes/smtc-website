<b>JOHNSON, W. I. L., 4 Apr
1834 - 3 Jan 1862. Inscription: "In memory of W. I. L. Johnson who was born
Apr 4th 1834 and departed this life Jan 3rd 1862. My youthful friends as you
pass by remember me as you are now so once was I. But as I am now you soon may
be so prepare for death and follow me. I hope we will meet where death will be
no more. Remembered by Elizabeth J. Johnson. Now I guess this stone will fuel a
debate concerning what the relationship of W. I. L. was to Elizabeth J. and
rightly so. Off in the distance notice part of the restoration crew taking a
break after a long days work of building the new fence and clearing the brush. <i>Photo &amp; info by
