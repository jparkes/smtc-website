COWSERT, Andie W. (Andrew), b. 1767 - d. 15 Apr 1826. (revised 25 Sep 2013 dates 
were: born 15 Apr 1826, died 1867.)<br/>
 This stone does not appear to be a style used in 
1867 so that indicates the second date is the death date as 1826 or was the same 
time this stone was set. (This very old hand-carved inscription is very hard to read. 
Dates appear as: "--DE 1867, and 15 Apr 1826." 
<br/>
This is now what I believe interpreting the parts starting at the top:  1st line: (unintelligible but looks like "DEC", 2nd line: "THE", 
3rd line: "1867 or 1863" 
(judging from the lettering and the available facts an error was made and it 
should be 1767 or perhaps 1763), 4th line: 
"ANDIE W." (but maybe ANDREW miss-inscribed), 
 5th line: "COWSERT",
 6th line:
"DE" (short for Deceased) 
then "AR" (Short for Apr) then "15",
7th line: 
"1826" (last digit not clear, but past transcribers have said it is a 6 as in 
1826) <br/>
Possibly this should be: Deceased 1867, born 15 Apr 1826. However a look on the 
site Ancestry.com records finds there was an Andrew Cowsert who was born abt 1763 and died 15 Apr 1826.) I am reversing the order of the transcription
 to indicate the birth year is shown first. It shows 1867, but evidence indicates the 
"8"
 of 1867 should be a "7" as in 1767. This is much closer to the estimated birth year of 1763 
(or some as 1767) others have made on Ancestry.com

This time line is 
presented on Ancestry.com and seems to be one of several with this  or 
similar information:<br/>

the Williamson County line)<br/>
It is clear there was a family of Cowserts' in this neighborhood and they were 
multiplying so there were probably more then one Andrew Cowsert. See Spring Hill 
Cemetery for other information. [CWA 25 Sep 2013]<br/>
Information and photo 
taken in October 2003 by Wayne Austin. Revised 25 Sep 2013 to include possible 
birth date of 1763 or 1767 and recognize reality of the short comings of this 
inscription.<br/>
