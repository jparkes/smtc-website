COWSERT, Andie W. (Andrew), b. 1767 - d. 15 Apr 1826. (revised 25 Sep 2013 dates 
were: born 15 Apr 1826, died 1867.)</br>
&nbsp;This stone does not appear to be a style used in 
1867 so that indicates the second date is the death date as 1826 or was the same 
time this stone was set. (This very old hand-carved inscription is very hard to read. 
Dates appear as: &quot;--DE 1867, and 15 Apr 1826.&quot; 
</font></br>
This is now what I believe interpreting the parts starting at the top: </font>&nbsp;</font>1st line:</font> (unintelligible but looks like &quot;DEC&quot;, 2nd line: &quot;THE&quot;, 
3rd line: &quot;1867 or 1863&quot; 
(judging from the lettering and the available facts an error was made and it 
should be 1767 or perhaps 1763), </font>4th line:</font> 
&quot;ANDIE W.&quot; (but maybe ANDREW miss-inscribed), </font>
 5th line: &quot;COWSERT&quot;,
</font> 6th line:
</font>&quot;DE&quot; (short for Deceased) 
then &quot;AR&quot; (Short for Apr) then &quot;15&quot;,
</font>7th line: 
&quot;1826&quot; (last digit not clear, but past transcribers have said it is a 6 as in 
1826) </br>
Possibly this should be: Deceased 1867, born 15 Apr 1826. However a look on the 
site Ancestry.com records finds there was an Andrew Cowsert who was born abt 1763 and died 15 Apr 1826.) I am reversing the order of the transcription
 to indicate the birth year is shown first. It shows 1867, but evidence indicates the 
&quot;8&quot;
 of 1867 should be a &quot;7&quot; as in 1767. This is much closer to the estimated birth year of 1763 
(or some as 1767) others have made on Ancestry.com

</font>This time line is 
presented on Ancestry.com and seems to be one of several with this&nbsp; or 
similar information:</br>

It is clear there was a family of Cowserts' in this neighborhood and they were 
multiplying so there were probably more then one Andrew Cowsert. See Spring Hill 
Cemetery for other information. [CWA 25 Sep 2013]</br>

birth date of 1763 or 1767 and recognize reality of the short comings of this
