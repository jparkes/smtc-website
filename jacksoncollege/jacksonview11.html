A
view looking at the </b></center><b> Jackson College
Cemetery at the </b><center><b>memorial
to William Hugh Brown, 1844-1912. There is a decorative wrought iron fence
surrounding this memorial. However, so far no evidence exist of any memorials
other inside. May be others fallen under the dense but cleared vegetation. Most of the cemetery is
still behind us. The Sons
of Confederate Veterans and the Boy Scouts of America has taken on the
difficult process of restoring this cemetery. We have been told but have not
confirmed with the records that the last family to own this property before it
became public land was the Brown family. That being much later than 1912 had to
be a descendent of William H. Brown. <i>Photo by WA. 10/27/20003. <a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.html"><br/>
