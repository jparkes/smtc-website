The Jackson College President's Home was still standing in recent times. It
is believed the old College </br>
was located near what is now known as Brown Road. This photo appeared in Hither
&amp; Yon in the photo </br>
section of Vol 1. The house already in a sad state of repair was torn away soon
after this photo which </br>
was made sometimes between 1960 and 1988.<i>
