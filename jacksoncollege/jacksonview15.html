view looking north down the third row at the Thompson, Haddox, Holland and other
stones. Some of the near front memorials are very large monuments tumbled by vandals,
farm animals and/or uncontrolled growth of scrub trees. Except for that this view
is of some of the most beautiful memorials found anywhere in the Maury County Cemeteries. It represents
the stones of some the south's most successful families in the 1800s. The box
tomb in the middle right of the photo is that of the Colonel James T. Sandford
who died in 1830. Some of the inscriptions in this cemetery are very historic in
nature yielding Civil War records, name places of Civil War battles, schools
persons attended and many memberships in churches. Many family relationships are
given in the inscriptions also. Other noteworthy information shown are Bible
Verses listing the book chapter and verse. While that is not unique it is unique
to see it on tombstones. So we know these people were very cultured and deeply
religious. <i>Photo by WA. 10/11/20003.&nbsp;<a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.htm"></br>
