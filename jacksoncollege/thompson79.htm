We provide you with this exchange between Wayne Austin and Dr. Julie Robertson Ashley
which occurred on Oct 29, 2003: Dear Wayne, This is becoming quite a pleasant
collaboration. Yes, I know of Lt. Thompson. I was the one who found his grave
when we first searched the cemetery a couple of years ago. His grave was hidden
under brush from trees and debris, and hard to read at first. But there he was,
a local man who died near Atlanta. A fine young man, he gave his life for the
state of Tennessee far away in Marietta and was returned back to the Brick
Church Presbyterian/Jackson College Cemetery for burial. He served with my
great-great-grandfather Tom Dunlap in the 3rd TN. He was in Company F, formerly
Company E - Captain R. B. McCormick, 1st Lt. D. G. Stevenson, 2nd Lt. Thomas
Thompson, Junior 2nd Lt. G. P. Straley, rank and file 77 men, with recruits.
There is a Giles County TN history website with the information about the unit at: <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/3rdtenn.htm">http://www.rootsweb.com/~tngiles/cvlwar/3rdtenn.htm</a><br>
