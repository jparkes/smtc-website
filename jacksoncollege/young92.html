<CENTER><b>YOUNG, Martha, 4
Feb 1766 - 7 Jan 1840. Inscription: &quot;IN MEMORY OF MARTHA YOUNG, BORN FEB
4,1766 DIED Jan 7, 1840. -- Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore
thee since God was thy ransom, thy guardian, thy guide. He gave thee, he took
thee and he will restore thee, And death has no sting since the savior has
(died.?)&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The base was found broken on 11-08-2003
and a photo was made.
The head stone was found 11-28-2003 and was set up then. The head stone
was found using a probing process about 3 inches below the
soil surface. This stone is located on the south 
end of the Bailey family memorials but in the next row, whereas; the Elizabeth Young memorial was on
the north end of the Bailey Stones. This is evidence that one of the ladies
who married a Bailey descended from this Martha born much earlier in 1766. My guess is it was
Martha Bailey 1806-1888. Both of their stones were heretofore lost
so if you can connect to these people this is a new genealogical discovery.<i></br>

<b>A foot
marker with the initials J. W. Y. was uncovered very near the fallen stone of
Elizabeth Young. It was next to the Anderson P. Bailey stone on the other end of
the Bailey family memorials. It was probably
the foot marker for the spouse, a son, or father of Elizabeth. Excuse the soil
stains they will weather away in time. The color of the soil stains is an
indication the stone has been buried for a long time perhaps more than a hundred
years. <i>Photo &amp; info by
