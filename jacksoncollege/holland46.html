HOLLAND, Winefred, 1 Jan 1812 - 11 Apr 1831. �Wife, James Holland &amp; dau.
of Col. James T. Sandford. </b></center><b>"In
memory of Winefred Holland wife of James Holland and daughter of Col. James T.
Sandford who was born the 1st of Jan. 1812 &amp; departed this life the 11th of
April 1831 in her 22nd? year. Possessed of an ingenious philosophical &amp;
benevolent mind. She formed such reciprocal friendships with kindred spirits of
her acquaintance as time hath only served to prove &amp; strengthen. The various
duties incident to the several relations of life as of daughter, wife, parent,
sister, neighbour &amp; friend, were discharged in a manner that endeared her to
all. For several years she lived a pious Christian &amp; member of the
Presbyterian church and died in the hope of that reward that was promised to the
faithful." </b><center><b>This
James Holland Jr mentioned was a son of the Revolutionary War Soldier James
Holland mentioned in "Let the Drums Roll", Veterans &amp; Patriots of
the Revolutionary War who Settled in Maury County." <br/>
This
top of the box tomb was broken into many pieces and scattered over a large area.
Many of the parts had sunken below the ground. I
think probably a large tree fell on it at one time smashing it into many parts. <i>Photo &amp; info by
