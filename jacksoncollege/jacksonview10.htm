A
view looking at the </font></b></center><b><font size="2"  color="#800080"> Jackson College
Cemetery at the </font></b><center><b><font size="2"  color="#800080">memorial
to Confederate Captain B. H. Holland who died in the Stones River
battle near Murfreesboro Tennessee. Notice the large Red Oak
Tree. This is actually the northeast
corner of the cemetery. Most of the cemetery is behind us. The Confederate Flag
was posted by a mystery person but was most likely put there by Dr. Julia Ashley
on one of her annual visits to this cemetery. She is a descendent of the Dunlaps
and Stephens interred in this cemetery and an avid historian dedicated to the
preservation of this cemetery and its history. </font></b></center><b><font size="2"  color="#800080">It
is proper that Confederate flag be displayed on this memorial. Captain
Holland died in Battle near Murfreesboro (Stones River) while serving
gallantly as a colors (flag) bearer for the Confederates. The base of the stone lies to the right of the main part. Red Oaks grow pretty
fast so the tree might not be more than 130 years old. </font></b><center><b><font size="2"  color="#800080"><i>Photo by WA. 10/27/20003.&nbsp;<font color="#000080"><a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.htm"><br>
