BAILEY, Martha wife of Anderson. We were at first missing the memorial for Martha. The small
footstone in the center has the initials M. B. which was a clue that Martha's
stone was sunken into the ground here. It was the footstone of Martha
Bailey, but we did not find a head stone until 11/22/03. The small base behind
the footstone is the base of the daughter who was also Martha Bailey, 1839-1843. </b></center><b><i>Photo &amp; info by

</i>BAILEY, Martha, 1 Mar 1806 - 7 Mar 1888, wife of Anderson P., footstone M.
B.. This stone was found 11-22-2003 for the first time. It had been buried for
many years. It was found by Wayne Austin with the help of Joseph Dungy. It was buried three
inches below the soil surface. The inscription can now be revealed. As you will
see below it is quite historic. The nearby base was the only clue that there was
an inscribed stone somewhere nearby. Inscription: &quot;MARTHA wife of A. P.
BAILEY, BORN IN ROCKINGHAM Co N. C., Mar. 1. 1806, MARRIED DEC 20, 1836, DIED
MAR 7th 1888.&quot; Sorry I had no equipment to remove the soil stains. They
will wash away with the rains. Photo of
the restored stone was made on 11-28-2003 and replaced with a photo made
11/29/2005. <i>Photo &amp; info by
Wayne Austin 11-28-2003. Not listed in MCTC.</i></p>
