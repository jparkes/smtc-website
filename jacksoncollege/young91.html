</i>YOUNG, This foot
marker with the initials J. W. Y. was found near the fallen stone of
Elizabeth Young 1801-1876. It was close to the Anderson P. Bailey stone. It was probably
the foot marker for the father, spouse or a son of Elizabeth.&nbsp; Likely the 
stone of Rev War Patrick Jacob Young, b. about 1760 d. 23 Apr 1847. See letters 
below:<i></br>

Wayne, I stumbled across your photo and information about Martha Young's 
tombstone while doing SAR research for someone in the Young family.</br>
I was thrilled when I saw that you found a footstone marked JWY. This is the 
burial place of Jacob W. Young and his wife, Martha Patrick Young. He was a 
Revolutionary War Patriot, having served in the Continental Navy. He was a 
pensioner and is on records in Maury County. He died 23 Apr 1847.</br>
This discovery should make it possible to place a VA headstone on this site! </br>
Is the JWY footstone still there?</br>
I look forward to hearing back from you ... </br>

Geoff I suppose it is still there. Finding it may be difficult but it likely is 
leaning against another headstone. I might have propped it against the headstone 
of Martha Young.&nbsp; The stone location and restoration there was by me but 
the grounds restoration was done by the SCV. They spent many more hours than I, 
and were busy churning up the place removing trees and brush far faster than I 
could ever keep up with their actions. Surely they did not misplace that 
footstone. They even had a large tree cutting crew in there to log the large 
trees and collected $2,000 receipts. This was not spent on the Jackson College 
Cem and the cemetery quickly went back to 
weeds and tall grass, soon to be trees again. I would have spent the money on Jackson College cemetery 
upkeep.</br>
</br>
You should be able to use my cemetery research &amp; photos in presenting that 
evidence. Whether or not the footstone can be found today I am not sure. As you can see 
the footstone photos show trees all around and by the time Martha's stone was 
found several days later the trees were gone as cleared by the SCV. Later I put 
all that together using the findings and Photos on into the Internet 
publication.</br>
</br>
The footstone &amp; Elizabeth Young's (a dau?) stones as I remember were in a same 
area. The Elizabeth Young stone &amp; footstone with the initials JWY were east of 
the Anderson P. Bailey monument and the Martha Young monument was found covered 
on the west side of the Anderson P. Bailey monument. That is across the old 
fence row which was striped out by the Sons of the Confederate Vets when the 
cemetery was restored. Probably the Bailey family was related to the Youngs' and 
that would explain co-mingling the graves, but actually in what seems to be 
three different rows. Maybe the footstone JWY &amp; Elizabeth Young's broken 
monument parts were just misplaced. The footstones get moved around 
all the time because of their small size and the failure of folks to tie them to 
the graves. I can attest to the age of the 
footstone as it is of the style that could be very old, as old as 1820 and maybe 
as young as 1850. It is near the same style stone as that for Martha b. 1766. 
The top is broken out so it is not easy to tell the exact full shape but seems 
to be flat across the top or oval, two very old styles which yields evidence to the 
support this being for Martha's husband Jacob.</br>

</font>All damaged and fallen tombstones 
from I am told a tornado, but also from livestock, mostly hogs. So from studying 
this photo it would seem the Young monuments are perhaps all in the same row but 
somewhat misplaced and broken. Recognize most of the above trees were cut and 
removed after these photos were made.</font></br>
</br>
Yes I would stand by your claim that JWY was for JW Young based on proximity and 
style of stones of the Young family there. If we dug around enough we might also 
find JW Young's headstone. Many of those old headstone lean toward the grave and 
softer soil and often fall or break and some sink into the grave far below the 
top of the ground, whereas if they fell away from the grave would only immerse 
about 2 inches under the soil in time.</br>

If you trace the mapping the location that cemetery is about a 
mile off the nearest road on farm roads riddled with gates. If anyone is going 
there better await the drying up of the rains.
