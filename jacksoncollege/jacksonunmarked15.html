Above is at least five tumbled box tombs of the Campbell family. The black
arrows point to the tops where the inscription is located. From left to right
by the numbers: (1) Edmund Harris Campbell 1817-1834 (son); (2) Martha Campbell
1819-1835 (daughter); (3) Robert B. Campbell 1821-1856 (son); (4) Robert T.
Campbell 1776-1847 (Patriarch); (5) Martha Campbell 1784-1856 (Matriarch). The parts
appear to be largely unbroken but some are far removed leaving me to believe this damage was caused by
rooting farm animals or the slow root growth of trees. Some of the parts are moved as far as six feet
away from the tumbled bases and
sides. There actually may be more tombs here. Some of the Campbell family
memorials have not been found including Alexander and maybe others. It is hard to tell
what part belongs to what box tomb from the buried and mixed parts. A major
reconstruction effort is needed here to identify and assign the parts to a tomb,
remove the parts out of the reconstruction area, clean them, then clean and
level the bases and reconstruct the tombs. These are high quality box tombs and
can be made beautiful when the bases are uncovered and leveled up and the stones
set over them. <i>Photo and information by Wayne Austin. Revised 12/12/20003. <a href="../lancaster-kerr-cemetery/lancasterview9.html"><br/>
