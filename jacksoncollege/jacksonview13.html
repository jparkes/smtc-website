A
view looking east from the west side of the Jackson College
Cemetery at the first three rows of memorials. There are Hollands,
Sandfords, Thompsons and others interred in the near view.<br/>
 Another photo of Mr. Horse is provided. He thinks the
cemetery is his space and I found out he was very territorial. I decided early
on I did not want to do conflict with Mr. horse for being in the cemetery considering he out weighs me by
at least 1,000 lbs. I am still wondering why the horse's owner did not
care enough to keep the fence up. <br/>
