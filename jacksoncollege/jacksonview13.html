A
view looking east from the west side of the Jackson College
Cemetery at the first three rows of memorials.&nbsp;There are Hollands,
Sandfords, Thompsons and others interred in the near view.</br>
 Another photo of Mr. Horse is provided. He thinks the
cemetery is his space and I found out he was very territorial. I decided early
on I did not want to do conflict with Mr. horse for being in the cemetery considering he out weighs me by
at least 1,000 lbs. I am still wondering why the horse's owner did not
care enough to keep the fence up.&nbsp;</br>
