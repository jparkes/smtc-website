said the following about some of the officers including Capt Holland: </font><u><font  size="2"> &quot;We
have to mourn the loss of many gallant officers and brave men, who fell in the
faithful discharge of their duty on the field of battle. Capt. L. N. Savage,
acting lieutenant-colonel, and Captain [J. J] Womack, acting major of the
Sixteenth Regiment, most efficient officers, were severely, if not mortally,
wounded, and Captain [D. C.] Spurlock, of the same regiment, an excellent
officer and most estimable gentleman, was killed. </font><font  color="#800080" size="2"><i>Capt.
B. H. Holland, of the Thirty-eighth Regiment, was killed while gallantly bearing
the colors of his regiment,</i></font><font  size="2">
and Acting Lieut. Col. R. A. Burford, of the Fifty-first, was wounded. These are
but a part of those who were either killed or wounded, but I must refer for
further details to the regimental reports, which I herewith transmit and beg to
make a part of my own. The Eighth Regiment lost most heavily both in officers
and men. In Company D, the gallant Captain [M. C.] Shook was killed, and the
lists show that out of 12 commissioned and noncommissioned officers and 62 men
who went into the fight only 1 corporal and 20 men escaped. Other companies
suffered almost as heavily&quot;<font color="#800000">.</font></font></u><font color="#800000"  size="2">&nbsp;
