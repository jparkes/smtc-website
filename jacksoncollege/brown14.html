 Â <center><b>BROWN, William Hugh, 1843 - 1912. (C. S. A.) A large decorative wrought iron
fence is surrounding this stone but there is no other stones inside. This is in the southwest
corner area of the cemetery. I was told by locals that
Mr. Brown's at one time owned the property surrounding the cemetery. The
property passed to UT Ag center sometime later.<br/>
