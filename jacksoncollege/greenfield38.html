GREENFIELD, Keren T., died 20 Jun 1832, in 23rd year. &quot;Wife of Dr. G. T.
Greenfield and daughter of Col. James T. Sanford.&quot;<i> </i>The stone of
Keren T. Greenfield was below the ground about 2 inches.&nbsp; I found it on 11-8-03 and uncovered the top and
transcribed it. The top was completely lost under brush and the ground but the parts
are all there and can be reassembled. This stone is next to the
box tombs of the prominent Sandford family and in between the infant box tomb of
T. S. Greenfield and two of what may be unused grave plots. Evidently the Infant &amp;
Keren died as a result of childbirth but not at the same time.<i>  Inscription:
&quot;</i>Here lies the body of KEREN T. the wife of Dr. G. T. Greenfield and

religion.&quot; <i> Photo &amp; info by
