MEMORIAL RESTORATION EFFORT IN PROGRESS - JACKSON COLLEGE CEMETERY.</b></p>

This
is a historical record of the restoration of the memorial stones of the Jackson
College/Old Brick Church Cemetery one and one half miles south of Spring Hill
Tennessee. Located on land bordering private owner�s property and UT
Agricultural Farm.<o:p>

Tornado or other high wind because most of the tall stones were fallen to the
east. Tornados come from the west and travel to the east. There is however
plenty of rumors that rooting hogs and cattle caused much of the damage along
with vandals.<o:p> </o:p>

Documented
and written by Wayne Austin for the
benefit of accurate historical records 1-04-04. This documents tracks the
possible alteration we might have made to the historical value of the Cemetery
Stone Records as a consequence of restoration. The original alteration of course
came with the destruction of the stones. Our task is simply to read the
clues and put the stones back into their original places with the intention of
preserving such information as who is buried where
in this cemetery and its associated depiction of family relationships. These
positions are at risk of being compromised when any change is made
to the position of the stones regardless of how scattered they are. We used
scientific judgment and the methodical application of various principals to
determine where the stones should be reset when we found them scattered. We make
no guarantees but feel the stones were placed back into the original positions
and in the direction they faced as they tower over the gravesite of the
deceased. The commentary below explains how we approached this for each stone
that was restored. As stated we may have been wrong for genealogical &amp;
historical purposes in some remote case but largely there were definite clues to
be read that told us we were certain of our restoration approach. My educated
estimate is that as of now only about 20% of the efforts needed to completely
restore all the memorials in this cemetery has taken place. There is always a
shortage of manpower and resources in these efforts.&nbsp; </o:p>

</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="background:white">
Also the Sons of
Confederate Veterans were in charge of the restoration but focused mainly on the
cleanup and fencing of the grounds whereas I directed my efforts on memorial
restoration. Most of the work on my part was done around my Christmas off-time
and I have not seen what was done by them lately (June 2004) nor have they updated me on
what, if any further efforts have been made toward memorial restoration. <o:p>
 I have not made an attempt to capture&nbsp; the Sons of Confederate Veterans
restoration effort in this writing since I am unaware of the memorial
restoration efforts they made.&nbsp;&nbsp; </o:p>

It
should be pointed out here that in no case are we dealing with the remains of
the deceased in a restoration effort. We only focus on the memorial stones. The
box tombs in this cemetery and others of the early to mid 1800s only serve to
cover the grave. The deceased were buried under ground as in any normal burial.
The remains are not located in the box tombs. I do not see my task as that of a
forensic pathologist and do not make evaluations in that regards. While I
have experience dealing with prehistoric American man�s remains with the U. of
AL. that will not be used. I joined my efforts with the SCV to focus on restoring the memorials,
security of the graves and landscaping and other historical relics while at the
same time enhancing the aesthetic and historical value of the Jackson College
Cemetery.<o:p>

was buried into the ground some three feet and could not be raised from the
ground and leveled with the equipment we had. Also discovered was that our
equipment was not high enough to hoist the shaft above the base for setting it
back up so we stopped there. We made a commitment to enlarge the Tripod Lifter
and secure more harness and digging equipment for freeing up and leveling the
base for a future attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>

attempting to level the base and set up the stone of B. H. Holland. It was not 
far enough from the tree so was moved about a foot closer to the footstone to 
get it in a place where it could be leveled up. Everyone on site that day 
pitched in but we found there was not the equipment on site to complete the 
stone. The stone will need leveling and gluing before it can be set up so it was neatly
stacked against the base for future restoration. The large oak tree towering
over this stone is dying and could shed limbs to crash down on this monument.<o:p>

of the pinch bar lifting equipment so we could get at the base from the correct

the original height because leaving it lower gives the stone more leverage to
stand straight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next we lifted the
1 ton shaft style headstone onto the base. The direction this stone faces is
assumed to be the same as that of her father Anderson�s stone located just to

lay on the ground after having fallen years ago.</br>

� We found a small base in front of the missing stone of Martha Bailey the
mother of the child in question here and found the daughter�s stone lying
about 10 feet to the north of the small base. We set the small shaft style stone
up on the small base assuming that was where it belonged. The Shaft did not
quite seem to fit the small base but we put it there anyway because there was no
evidence that it belonged anywhere else. We should<span style="mso-spacerun:

area better to be certain there is no lost stone that belongs there. Making
sense is the fact that Mother and infant daughter are interred next to each
other but actually one row apart. Well, at least our resetting suggest that is
the case. Of all the resetting of the stones this one is the only one that left
me doubting a bit. This is mainly because the shaft part of the infant�s
memorial is a bit small for the base.</br>

- Got some of the guys cutting wood together along with the tripod to set up the
Odil stone. It has 10 inscriptions on it representing the many deaths of that
family from the infectious disease outbreak during 1853. It has a slanted
fracture on the bottom of the shaft and another across the stone about half way
up. The stone would not stand on the base without the aid of temporary
strapping. The wood cutting guys got in such a hurry that the stone was set up
with a slight misalignment at the fracture line on the bottom as I went to the
truck to secure tools, so that this must be eliminated for long term holding
strength. The bottom fracture is at an angle and is critical to the stand up of
the shaft on the base. The strapping will be replaced later (11-28-03) by a
large permanent steel clamp. The top fracture has a small amount of misalignment
that also needs to be eliminated or the parts will wear away.

- We set the new steel clamp in place for the Odil stone. Ran into trouble
trying to realign it. The clamp would not draw out the misalignment in the
fracture. Later I will bring a 100 pound steel clamp and see if that will
realign the stone with the fracture, but may need to lift the weight off of the
stone to improve the alignment of the fracture. Probably should give the
fracture a good cleaning because the woodcutters threw it up while I was gone to
my truck to fetch tools. More time needed to fix this one right.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><u></br>

- Surveyed the Winnefred (Sandford) Holland box tomb in the Sandford Family row
and concluded that all the parts are there. Also concluded it had a solid carved
stone base underground that should be dug up and cleaned for setting all the
parts upon. The ends, sides and corner pieces are solid and will stand up. There
is a problem with the top being broken into small pieces. The top will need to
rest on a sheet of steel or be supported by concrete blocks lain inside the tomb
or both. A&nbsp; non-corrosive metal sheet of at least 1/4 inch thick
to support the broken pieces of the top after they are glued back together. Also missing are some of the C shaped
metal fasteners that bind the ends to the sides. Should fill the tomb cavity with a supporting material
such as cinder blocks to support the top and cap that off with smooth layer of
cement<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to support the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></br>
12/18/03 - Set up the Tripod over the box tomb parts and cleaned the base. The
base was evaluated as not level enough to support the box tomb in the setup
position because of the broken top. So I placed the two sides side by side and
flat on the ground on top of the base with the ends remaining up on the west end
but leaving the east end on the ground. I stacked the corners beside the ends
and spread the broken top parts on the sides in a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

until a piece of sheet steel at least � inch thick can placed for supporting
the broken top. The following photo shows how we left this tomb. A future

should hold for good without major interruption from a violet force.</br>
12-8-03 - Set up the tripod over the box tomb of Keren T Greenfield, wife of Dr
G. T. Greenfield and dug up and moved the tops, sides and end pieces away from
the base. The base was dug out and cleaned and reassembly began by setting up
the sides, corners and ends. Discovered the east end piece was missing so I
prodded for that and found only a piece of it. No luck in finding the other
missing part yet. After I stood up the sides, corners and the one unbroken end I
took the half of the broken top that had most of the inscription on it and
installed that upon the assembly to help hold it in place. At that point the
tomb was stabilized and I left it until an end can be made from limestone. A
piece of the top is also missing and might yet be found. The end that is broken
is 20.25 inches wide by 24 Inches high.12/18/03
� Probed some more and located the missing third part of the broken top. Also
located another section of the broken end. Enough to use to secure a setup. Set
up the tripod and install the second section of the broken top and set in place
the second broken piece of the end. The third section of the broken top was then
installed and wedge stones were put into place to bind the assembly together. <o:p>

- The Young Dimond, son of S &amp; A Dimond memorial stone was lying in the
Bailey area pointing to the east with the face up. We dug a hole right where it
was and set it up. Its bottom was even with the far row of Bailey stones and
gave us the impression that it belonged there. It is important to know that we
faced the stone in the same way that it was lying. That is west. However the
stone could have been in any direction. A previous visitor could have turned it
over to read it and left it face up. Visitors might have done that in many cases
since all of he stones were left with the inscription face up. However if they
all faced west and the tornado felled them onto their eastern side then that
would have explained the position of the stones as being face up. That is
another indication that this stone actually faced in an easterly direction. We
are also uncertain that the stone should have even been in the Bailey family
area. His is the only stone found thus far with the surname Dimond. There is no
family cluster that is obvious unless he was in fact a part of the Bailey family

- Next we focused our attention on the John Kennedy stone further to the east
and did our best to first find the broken base. As it turns out it was one foot
below the ground. With or without the base we knew we could set the stone in the
right place based on (1) the alignment of John's foot stone, (2) Nancy his
wife's head and foot stone and (3) finding the broken base. So we dug down to
the base and set the stone there in the proper alignment and row we thought at
the time. Turns out we had set it up about 8 more inches to the north than the
original setting of the stone. I will not go back and correct that because it
has a bag of Quickrete 12 inches below the ground holding it in place. That just
means the stone is 8 inches too close to Nancy's headstone and is not that
noticeable. I did want a permanent record for anyone interested in the details
of anything that might somehow alter the cemetery records, because it is
possible to change the historical record when one resets a stone. Based on the
alignment of the stone to the fracture on the base we faced this stone in an
easterly direction. Without question this is the correct direction according to
the original setting.<o:p>

- Each fix creates another need. All these stones we are setting up have left
gapping pits in the ground where the stone had sunken that need to be filled.
Just looks bad and can't mow there either. Holes will also cause damage to the
deceased remains by allowing an accumulation of water to invade the grave. Ugh!
Also the newly set up stones have bad soil stains on them that will take years

- Next we used the probe and found and uncovered the small stone of Martha Young
1766 - 1840 and reset that one in the ground . We just set it deeper than normal
so it is OK I believe. It is a small stone anyway because a piece<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/Img_2105.jpg" align="left" width="442" height="330"> remains in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

set that one up. I believe we set it too far back and too far right of grave
though, but can correct that later. The Martha Young memorial has a broken base
that is true to the alignment of the head stone. We set the broken stone east
of; but against the broken base. We faced the stone in the same direction (west)
it was
uncovered assuming it had fallen on its face. That may not be correct but is the
best evidence we had. This stone was unknown in any records and represents a new
Maury County genealogical discovery. As it turns out I believe Martha Young was
the mother of Martha Bailey and the wife of J.W. Young a lost headstone but in 
place footstone. At least that is my theory and this probably needs
further proof. All these (Martha Young, Martha Bailey &amp; JW Young stones were buried under the ground and are new

- We switched gears here and moved back over to the Crypt Row (The Sandford
Family Box Tomb Row) and set up the box tomb of T. S. Greenfield the infant son
of Dr. G. T. &amp; Keren T. Greenfield. This one will not stand long term and
needs to be supported inside the tomb with further supportive materials to keep
the sides from collapsing inside and tumbling the whole stone. The sides and

further work is needed there.</br>

- Surveyed the Winnefred (Sandford) Holland box tomb in the Sandford Family row
and concluded that all the parts are there. Also concluded it had a solid carved
stone base underground that should be dug up and cleaned for setting all the
parts upon. The ends, sides and corner pieces are solid and will stand up. There
is a problem with the top being broken into small pieces. The top will need to
rest on a sheet of steel or better non-corrosive metal at least 1/4 inch thick
to support the broken pieces of the top. Also missing are some of the C shaped
metal fasteners that bind the ends to the sides. Toying with the idea of
drilling the center of the broken top parts and inserting a pin clamp which I
will have to invent (machine) to draw the fractured parts together. This will
have to lye flush with the bottom of the top to allow the top to rest on a
surface of some kind. Also could fill the tomb cavity with a supporting material
such as cinder blocks to support the top and cap that off with smooth layer of
cement<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to support the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></br>
12/18/03 - Set up the Tripod over the box tomb parts and cleaned the base. The
base was evaluated as not level enough to support the box tomb in the setup
position because of the broken top. So I placed the two sides side by side and
flat on the ground on top of the base with the ends remaining up on the west end
but leaving the east end on the ground. I stacked the corners beside the ends
and spread the broken top parts on the sides in a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>manner so that they could be read by visitors. It will remain that way
until a piece of sheet steel at least � inch thick can placed for supporting
the broken top. <o:p>

- Next we changed back to the Bailey Row and went about trying to level the base
of the Anderson P. Bailey stone so we could proceed to set up the three massive
and beautiful parts of that memorial. Turns out the base was sunken so far into
the ground (or about 2 feet) that we could not pry it out with the equipment we
had. Believe that thing weighed up to 2 tons anyway. We raised one side and the
other side would sink up further canceling our efforts. Our lifting strength was
limited by the depth which the base had sunken into the ground and also by the
wet ground from the recent rain. I believe we could have been successful had the
ground been dry. We ran out of energy and did not want to risk an unsafe
situation. We abandoned that one for now until we could get an upgrade on the
lifting equipment and the ground dries out.</br>
12/22/03 - I went there with improved equipment and strapping and lifted the
base out of the ground and filled the hole back to about 12� below the ground
tamping the soil about every 4 inches. Next I installed about five field stones
for added support and leveled the ground well around them tamping it with a 80
pound pipe. Next the base parts were set back into place and leveled. At that
point owing to the fact that the base will still settle some, I only put the
inscribed section of the stone in place facing it to the west which happens to
be the way it was facing on the ground as it had fallen. The stone will still
need to have the shaft and cap installed. There might still be a missing part
that could be located on the cap at the top. Maybe an angel or some other
figurine can be found below the soil there somewhere.  <o:p></o:p>

- I stayed another thirty minutes and cleared out vines and brush in the
Campbell Box tomb area further east of the main area where we have focused most
of our time. The Campbell area will be a challenge since the five known tops are
about 500 lbs and very wide and must be dealt with using methods that prevents
them from banging together as they are repositioned back into their original
spots. The tops of the stones have to be moved out of the work area of the tomb
assembly to prevent that from hampering us because the top is the last piece
that will be put in place. Many of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
bases appear to be out of level. It is a major challenge to level a three ton

The
early part of he day was spent clearing brush from the main part of the cemetery.
Focused on the thick vines and dead logs in the Campbell box tomb area. Then
began to strip the dead lower branches from the Bodak trees that will remain in
the cemetery. After that the brush was piled up to be burned. My attention was
then turned to restoration of the stones.<o:p>
 Of course I am making no statement about the CSV and all the hours of cleanup
they did prior to my little small effort here. I will happily let them speak for
themselves as to what was done in their news articles.</br>
Regarding what was done here and what remains to be done. All the work was done
as in interim to completion, but there was few cases where we could say a stone
was completely restored to the original state. This was because of just a
shortage of materials and manpower to get the job done. Most of the work above
was done by one person, the author of this writing. I must say it was a
challenge to rig and place heavy stones without the aid of motorized lifts using
only a simple tripod and hoist. However, we are glad to say that there was no
environmental damage to the cemetery from heavy equipment use.&nbsp;</br>
Now Aug 2004.&nbsp; I am presently becoming equipped with the knowledge to
complete the works above using the techniques employed by Dan Sumner Allen IV of
Nashville, principal of Cumberland Research Group. Dan is also affiliated with
Nancy Adgent Morgan, Technical Liaison for Tennessee Cvil War Heritage Area and
