TORNADOS of 27 APRIL 2011 - These Violet forces of Nature that do strange things<br>
<br>
</b></font><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Though there were many tornados on 
that day I will focus mostly on one Tornado, the one shown portrayed in the map 
below using the 
black line that hit North Alabama in the afternoon of 27 April 2011, In 
particular I will focus on the damage caused around western Madison County and 
eastern Limestone County as I know it from visiting and assessing these cemetery 
sites after the storm. </font><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">
<font id="role_document0" face="Arial">
The area of my awareness was within several miles of my home in northwestern 
Madison County. </font></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">
<font id="role_document0" face="Arial">
The cemeteries that fared the worst are the Nick Davis&nbsp;monument, Andrews 
Cemetery in French�s Mill &amp; the Pike Cemetery in Madison County. The storm that 
hit Pike Cemetery was an EF1 tornado that hit about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. 
It was going east basically following the direction of Highway 72 into Madison 
Alabama. It felled a couple of large 75+ foot pine trees directly into the 
cemetery knocking over several monuments. This cemetery is in such bad shape it 
will need the help of a crew of folks to get it back into shape, Especially with 
the added damage from the storm. Since no progress has been made there I will 
focus on the Nick Davis Monument and the Andrews Cemetery. There were several 
cemeteries impacted that were close to the main track of the EF5 storm that was well 
maintained and the maintenance crew showed up and took care of the downed trees 
thus nothing to be done. The Nick Davis is a high profile cemetery that will be 
taken care of by someone because of its prominence in the area. The Andrews 
Cemetery is an abandoned cemetery that will require special care since no one 
will bother to fix the major problems there. That is what I deem as my role in this 
area. </font></span></p>

  Hackleburg Tornado the meanest of mean storms.</b></font><font id="role_document" color="#800000" face="Arial"><p>
  The map here shows the path of what has been named the Hackleburg Tornado, a 
  feared EF5 violet force like a giant roto-rooter that destroyed many little 
  towns and left a path of death and destruction across north Alabama that will 
  be felt for years. Many folks lost their lives and others everything they 
  owned that fateful day. </font>
  <font id="role_document" color="#000000" face="Arial">
  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">The path&nbsp;plotted on 
  this map is relatively accurate though the storm was wider in some places and 
  may have dropped multiple vortexes making it as wide as a mile sometimes and 
  as narrow as 300 yards in others. I&nbsp; know this is an accurate portrayal 
	in my area 
  above because I plotted the black line on this map and then zoomed into the  
  roads and places in more detail. Then later I drove around the Madison &amp; 
  Limestone County roads to confirm its accuracy against the actual damage path. However, the width of the&nbsp; 
  black line has no bearing to reality because of the changing nature of the 
  storm and the simplicity of graphics. There was little damage after the storm crossed Highway 53 in Anderson 
  Hills, so the storm must have lifted up to some degree after that. I also was 
  not able to confirm the path in other counties southwest of Madison &amp; 
  Limestone but based on other information believe this plotting to be close to 
  accurate. The curvature of the earth left this image with a small amount of 
  error as the line above was exactly straight and a perfectly accurate line would have a 
  slight bow in it.</span></font></p>
  <p><font id="role_document1" color="#000000" face="Arial">
  <span style="color: #800000">As mentioned the Hackleburg Tornado destroyed 
  Hackelburg/Phil Campbell/New Hope/Frenchs Mill &amp; Harvest, and many other 
  places across north Alabama spanning a distance of 90+ Miles and killing 50+ 
  people. Now I did do some volunteer work to help the living clean up so don't 
  accuse me of of worrying only about the dead folks.</span></div>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">
  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">Our first cemetery to be 
  covered is the the Nick Davis Monument. It was hit by the worst part of the 
  storm and knocked over and buried under about 50 tons of tree rubble. It is a 
  big stone weighing about 10 tons and is about 30+ feet tall. I went there 
  after the Tornado and climbed among the fallen tree limbs to get photos of the 
  disaster.<br>

  This is the main trunk of the stone with the inscription. It is barely visible 
  after 27 Apr 2011. As you can see it was buried among the destroyed trees. 
  Remarkably there was no major damage to this part of the monument. None of the 
  three segments of the monument were broken, but the top spire was knocked off 
  the mid section and found lying on the ground under the debris. The mid 
  section, partly visible here, was sticking up among the fallen debris. A later 
  assessment found a corner broken off from the fall which had the �N� Of 
  Nicholas on it so that piece was kept and glued back on in the repair effort.<br>

  </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">This photo was made after about 10 hours of 
	my cutting and clearing of 
  downed trees 
  within a ten feet radius of the stone. Here we see the top spire lying to the 
  east of the rest of the monument showing the usual tornado wind direction.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000"><br>

  <br>
  I was able to find the parts that had inscribed lettering on 
  them and glue them back on. Then the rest of the fracture was restored by 
  filling in the remaining gaps with a Type K mortar mix. (approved for historic 
  monuments)&nbsp; The proper formula to repair that&nbsp; was 1 part Type N 
  mortar, 3 parts hydrated Lime &amp; 8 parts white sand with water to make it to 
  the proper thickness to mold and shape. I trialed the mix into the fracture 
  and smoothed it to blend it in. I&nbsp; expected to see a color difference because the 
  stone has natural patination &amp; some stains that leaves it darker gray.<br>

  This photo included was made after the monument was back up again. I am unaware of who reinstalled the 
  top back onto the base. I finished restoring the base and clearing a good path 
  back there to the stone and within two days of that the crane showed up without my knowledge. 
  When I 
  went back there several days later it was standing tall. Many thanks to 
  whomever. They did reset it slightly off center about 1/2 inch to the south, but maybe that 
  is not a problem. Who knows where the center of balance on a monument that 
  large is anyway. </p>

  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">The all metal historical marker next to Nick Davis Road sustained no damage 
  because it was not close enough to falling trees to be harmed. There was also 
  a green road sign that said: NICK DAVIS MONUMENT. It was twisted and bent and 
  needs to have a new base installed. <br>

  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">The above photo was made before any efforts to clear 
  the land were made. However some trees had been partly cut away to clear Nick 
  Davis Road of trees lying in the road. Notice all these trees fell north to 
  northeast. This is the same storm that hit the Andrews Cemetery mapped above 
  and details included below but those trees fell to the southeast. This is some 
  ten miles as a crow flies northeast of the Andrews Cemetery. Accordingly the 
  damage the center of this storm was about 500 yards east along Nick Davis Road 
  so that really leaves me tangled in thought about direction of the spin of the 
  tornado and multiple vortexes. Anyway I attempted to explain the event in the 
  Andrews Cemetery right or wrong. These were not typical large spin event 
  tornados. They appeared to be very wide, deep black/orange in color because I 
  was watching this tornado when I looked out the window of a basement shelter 
  about 1.5 miles southeast.

  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">The above photo was made 
  after some efforts to clear the area. Much work remains though in the area as we 
  can see in this photo and the part of the cemetery to our right our of our 
  view. There is now a 
  clear path to the stone monument from the road. It is about 40 feet wide and 
  all the way back to the monument. Update: moneys from tornado damage must have 
	been provided here as the grounds have now been restored of all the pits 
	from rootballs and the premises now kept mowed. So the main difference is 
	after the tornado there are no more trees in the cemetery. Great ending 
	here.</span></p>

  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #800000">Turning now our attention to the 
  Andrews Cemetery which was also hard hit. This cemetery is in the French's Mill area along Highway 
  72. This cemetery is another site&nbsp;of major damage. I will detail one of 
  the remarkable events of this storm. That is what happened to the J.D. Thomas 
  monument.<br>

	Tree behind the stone about 6 feet from the stone.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">
  <span style="color: #800000">This photo above&nbsp; was taken 27 Sep 
  2010 when this stone was standing. Unfortunately this cemetery endured the 
  brunt of the Hackleburg Tornado on 27 Apr 2011 at about 4:30 P.M. in the 
  afternoon. The large Red Oak Tree behind the stone was uprooted destroying 
  this grave and the memorial. The memorial plunged about 4 feet down into the 
  large pit created when the root ball of the tree flipped up into the air as 
	the tree fell. The 
  little footstone barely seen behind the tree was crushed into the ground when 
  the tree fell on it and is no longer visible. </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">
  <span style="color: #800000">This snapshot above was taken 
  after the Tornado uprooted a large Red Oak tree just east 
  of this stone. The tree is shown intact in the first above photo. This event created 
  a large pit and the memorial stone plunged into the sink 4+ feet down into the 
  crevice.
  This stone was in severe danger of disappearing underground as the giant root 
  ball dissolved (from the weather) back into the pit. It would have gradually 
  covered the stone forever as the dirt melted away and fell back into the pit.
  Any visitor after that visiting here with a grave listing from a historical 
	book would have been 
  perplexed as to what happened to the monument.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a major effort to salvage this stone because of the depth of the pit 
  and the size of the stone. There was serious danger to the salvage crew 
  because the root ball was capable of caving off and burying anyone attempting 
  to salvage the stone. Due care was taken to prevent that. I went there with a 
  tripod lift and added a strap around the stone and lifted it back up to 
  the surface with the block and tackle. Unfortunately I was unable to salvage 
  the base. It was upside down sticking down into the soft brown muck which 
  amounted to the remains of the grave so I left it and it will be covered in 
	respect for the deceased. 
  Another base can be secured from scraps from the nearby French's Millstone, 
	(building seen in the distance in one of the photos) an operation 
  manufacturing cut limestone blocks about 400 yards to the northeast of this 
  cemetery. They have many limestone scraps that could be made into a base for this 
  stone at no cost.</span></p>

  <font id="role_document" color="#800000" face="Arial">
  <p class="MsoNormal">Notice the Andrews memorial (center of the above last photo) just to 
  the right of the splintered cedar tree. The tornado felled this Cedar tree 
  close by &amp; it barely missed this stone. However most of the top of the cedar was 
  broken off separately and swept up into the debris field and eventually fell some 150 feet out into the 
  field completely away from the cemetery. All the trees fell in a southeasterly 
  direction indicating the tornado was swirling clockwise and the southeast part 
  of the vortex (Swirl) hit this cemetery on its south side. This indicates the 
  center of the vortex was just to the north of this cemetery assuming this 
  tornado did not have multiple vortexes. Well this may be too complex for my 
  simple analogy so that analogy is in the for what is is worth column. Reading 
	this my weather man could say brilliant, or be laughing at me. Anyway I made 
	as good a grade as they in studying some of these subjects.</p>

  <b>My unscientific graphic which may portray the storm path and direction

  </font><font id="role_document" color="#800000" face="Arial">
  <p class="MsoNormal">This is my very rough graphic estimate of how the tornado 
  may have affected the Andrews 
  Cemetery. The National Weather Service named this the Hackleburg Tornado after 
	killed many people, demolished many homes, the School, the Town and major churches there, but 
  this was 90+ miles northeast from Hackleburg, but was the same storm. Here in 
  this area 
  in Limestone and Madison County there were much more expensive assets in its path. Namely hundreds of 3,000+&nbsp; 
  square foot homes due to this area having a high per capita income that has 
  always ranked high in the national records.<br>
  Some of you are wondering why more is not being done to fix the above 
  problems. It was early on and the folks were taken care of first. I am doing more than my 
	little part. In our 
  society of multicultural existence we do not have folks that join together in 
  projects like this anymore, because it is so easy for many of us to point out 
  that these are not my ancestors graveyards therefore I don't care. I am 
  pleased at what I see was being done for the hapless people that suffered 
  losses from the above storms though and know that ugly thinking did not 
	prevail there. After they are taken care of I remain as usual 
  wondering why we don't care more for the historical relics all around us that 
  helps give us meaning to our existence and keeps us connected to the past. 
	Storm damage crew without my knowledge did show up and remove the downed 
	trees and repair the&nbsp; grounds.<br>
