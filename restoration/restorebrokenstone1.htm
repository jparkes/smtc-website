<left><font color="#000080">As you can see the task here is to put
the two parts back together so that they appear to be a part of one stone again. In the
process we will need to set the stone upright instead of leaving it in a leaning
position and also bond the two broken parts together. It could
be said at the outset that the stone broke in half due to the thinness of the
stone and because the stone is leaning badly. But the specific cause was probably
the result of being struck by a falling tree or limb or perhaps another reason. Stones that are 6 to 12
inches&nbsp; in thickness of quality Granite rarely break in half unless subject
to very violet circumstances, but this stone is only about 3 inches thick.&nbsp;
Older Stones of the nineteenth century were rarely thicker than four inches. While one could simply straighten the base and
place the broken top back on the bottom half that would be a
temporary fix and would result in failure with the slightest vibration. The
solution will need to be addressed from two approaches.<br>
<br>
1. The base must be leveled and set in a 40 lb bag of Quickset Concrete
to keep it upright. If the main part of the stone is loose at the joint from the base two or more bags will be
required to cover the main part of the stone which sits into the base.&nbsp;If 
using concrete be sure to set the stone deeper into the ground thus leaving the 
unsightly concrete covered by soil.<br>
2. The two halves must be cleaned at the fracture seam and bonded with the latest efforts
and materials to yield a sustainable upright strength.<br>
This method will be accomplished by first bonding the two halves together at the
seam with the latest Stone bonding materials. Next a rectangular Aluminum
back-plate about 3/8 inch thick of varying rectangular sizes based on the need
of the repair is pre-measured so that no drilling and bolting will occur around
the inscription. Four holes are drilled into the back plate at each corner and
then four matching holes are drilled into the stone. That is two in the upper half and
two in the lower half. If the breakage is thru the inscription be sure to 
exercise care in the use of epoxies to not cover the inscription in a way that 
the glues cover up the inscription. This must all be have been pre-measured and planned out
so that the the four holes drilled into the
four corners will match the holes in the bottom and upper
broken halves of the stone. We should have a tight fit everywhere as errors with 
looseness will
only cause quick failure.

<P><font color="#000080">
The tools needed for the above repair are as follows: Carpenter's level, a
shovel and a rake, a stiff plastic bristle brush and maybe some other non-acidic
of alkaline cleaning
supplies, a good quality portable hand drill (or use a drill press if one is available) with a drill
that will bore thru a 3 or four inch stone. This should be a&nbsp; 3/8&quot; diameter titanium, diamond or concrete drill
bit. Also needed is a carpenters measuring tape, and a lead pencil
with a sharp point, plastic pail for mixing a 40 lb bag of concrete. Enough
water for one or two 40 lb bags of concrete and cleaning.&nbsp;<br>
The materials needed are: three tubes of exterior grade epoxy glue, one tube of concrete
bonding cement and sealer for filling the fracture, one or two bags of Quickset
Concrete,&nbsp;
three 3/8&quot;&nbsp; by 4 1/4&quot; (or long enough to go thru the thickness of
the stone and fit snuggly to minimize the repair) stainless steel or galvanized steel
bolts with the nuts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
To repair the above stone on site (assuming one has made the preliminary
measurements and purchased or cut the aluminum plate the size that is needed and
predrilled the four holes in the four corners of that) one proceeds by removing the top half and set it out of the way
temporarily. The area around the base is raked clean to get at the base and
soil. The soil is pulled back from the base for about a two square foot area or
enough to be able to set the base upright and level. This may require digging
out as much as the top 4&quot; or more of soil with the shovel. When enough soil is removed to straighten up
the base go ahead and stand the base upright &amp; straight taking care not to
stress the base joints by applying too much pressure to the straightening
effort. If the main stone is loose from the base and moves back and forth you
will need to set the main stone into concrete thereby replacing the sloppy base
joint. If the base is tight against the stone and it becomes clear that the stone cannot be straightened by a small
amount of effort then dig out more soil. Repeat this until the base is loosened
enough to be straightened. Now dig out more soil around the base to make a place
for the concrete to bond to the base and increase its size and strength. Next
using the carpenters level check and adjust the
bottom half accordingly to get the stone standing perfectly upright so that it no longer
leans toward the ground. Be sure to check the plumb upright from two corners to
be certain the stone is upright and not leaning back, to the front or to the
side. A bag of quickset concrete is then mixed and poured into the dug out
area around the base to anchor the base and the bottom half of the stone. When finished the soil is raked back
into place to cover the base of the stone as it was before. Wait thirty minutes
until the concrete is set enough to proceed without loosening the stone. Of course one may
need to modify the instruction above for a stone that was set shallow in the
ground. In such a situation set the stone base deeper into the ground than it
was before.&nbsp; At the opposite spectrum when the stone is set abnormally deep
into the ground it may need to be dug up and set in place with less depth.
However, modify your procedures above as needed according to the depth of the
stone. If you remove the stone be sure you line it up in the same place it was
before. Never move a stone without an original drawing of its exact place in the
cemetery even if that is not the place where the stone was originally set. It
would be a disaster to historians and laws may be broken to place Joe Blow's
stone next to John Doe's in error. Old cemeteries rarely have perfect rows for
the graves and memorials. Clustering families in group burials was more
important to our ancestors than perfect order throughout the cemetery.<br>
<br>
Now that we have the base half well anchored in concrete in the ground and
standing straight upright we must turn our attention to bonding the upper half to the
bottom half at the fracture line. First give the two halves a quick inspection
looking for superficial cracks. If these are found then special attention will
be required for that. For the sake of this discussion we have found the two
halves to be sound and ready to proceed. To work with the stone you
may will need to clean the fractured surface of both the bottom and top half. Take the brush and
scrub the fractured face of both
pieces
until they are both free of debris and clean enough to set tightly together and support the glues.&nbsp;Use
other cleaning supplies if needed but do not use harsh acid or alkaline cleaning
compounds.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some preliminary work and planning must have been done for this repair
method. We must know the size of the back support plate that supports the
joints. That is because if we are not careful we will drill holes in the
inscription which is a NO NO. We must have the backside plate large enough to be
able to drill the holes thru the stone so that the inscription can still be
read. Drilling holes around the inscription is a quick way to shorten the life
of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
 Next we will
measure and drill the four holes into the Aluminum Plate first with a different
drill bit made for metal<b>. </b>Then the four holes are bored into the
stone.&nbsp; The drawing below depicts that process. Afterward the bolts are set in place in Epoxy Glue to support the two halves.&nbsp;
<center><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/restorestoneplatedraw.jpg" align="left" width="425" height="433"><br></center>The holes must match up or the two fracture lines of the stone will not set
together properly.&nbsp; The pins will be bonded into the stone halves with Epoxy glue
to insure a long term outcome. If there is loose slop the upper half of the stone
will fall or a large crack will show between the two halves leaving room for future failure.&nbsp; I must add here that
accurately drilling four holes with into stone is no
easy feat. A drill press works much better than a hand drill for this
process because the process can be stabilized and set up as a fixture. If it
requires a drill press one would remove the stone from the cemetery. In that
case first put into
place a temporary marker with the vital stone inscription. Afterward one could
proceed to
the site where the drill press is set up.&nbsp;Also before removing the stone from the cemetery one will need to notify the proper
cemetery authorities so that permission may be granted and an accounting for the
whereabouts of the stone is available at all times.<br>
<br>
Last we will need to apply the concrete bonding cement over the surface of both the
upper fracture and the lower fracture to seal out the water from the break. This
must be done quickly so that the epoxy for the bolts is not past its hardening
prime.

And viola we have the result shown at left for Robert Ozni Alexander of the Reeses Chapel Cemetery. I did not do this restoration. It is however an
excellent example of a restoration using this method.&nbsp;
