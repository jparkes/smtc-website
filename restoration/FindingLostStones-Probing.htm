  &nbsp;Probing for lost stones &amp; parts is a slow tedious process that 
requires difficult efforts to discover the missing stone or part. I write this in an attempt to get 
more folks involved in finding lost stones, because the more we have looking, the 
more stones that can be recovered. </font></p><center>
<div>
  <font id="role_document" face="Arial">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I will use a common case to show the &quot;how to&quot; of the 
	procedure. It is for a husband Robert Clark, A Revolutionary War Soldier who died 1837. 
	In the below his stone is missing, and 
	his wife Rebecca d. 1825 The wife's stone is still standing. We are looking for the Robert Clark's 
	stone which is buried next to 
	his wife. Her at this stage, unknown husband lived 
	several more years he likely did not live long enough for the styles of 
	stone to change to the multi part monument. Therefore chances are he has the 
	same style stone, assuming he was given a tombstone and not just a 
	fieldstone. If his death was after about 1875 (in the south) the monument&nbsp;could be one of those multi-part stack type. In that case at least some part 
	of the monument usually survives to tell us there was a grave stone. 
	In that case and others we at least have some idea what we are probing for. <br>

	This is an actual example of finding a lost stone in the Clark Cemetery in 
	Madison County Alabama. Notice the photo on the left shows a yellow &quot;X&quot;  
	where the lost stone resides under the ground. There at the yellow X the 
	effort was focused with the probe to uncover this stone. This photo on the 
	right shows the uncovered stone with the brown stains on it. It is common 
	procedure in H/W burials to have the wife buried on the left side of the 
	husband as is the case here. This stone was probed for also by the knowledge from the book Madison Al 
	Tombstone inscriptions that there was a grave here, but there was no sign of 
	it as you can see from the photo with the &quot;X&quot;. To find it an imaginary straight line was drawn due northward from the 
	wife Rebecca Clark's standing monument (light colored one on your right- 2nd 
	photo)&nbsp; 
	at a distance of about 4 or five feet. Probing began and eventually that 
	familiar dink was felt and heard. We then moved over about 6 inches and 
	again went down 4 inches and received the same response and repeated that 
	enough that a pattern was developing. So I took the 
	shovel and dug down and found the edge of the stone at several places and 
	began uncovering it before lifting it from the ground. There was a 
	footstone RC but based on the alignment it should belong to Rebecca Clark 
	and not Robert Clark. I did not come to this cemetery that day with 
	restoration plans so the stone bottom was set deep enough into the ground to 
	make it stand and the top part was propped against that making sure no 
	inscription was resting against a contact point. This prevents the 
	inscription from being worn away as movement always occurs&nbsp; between the 
	two parts.<br>
	<br>
	As for those older long stones like our monument for the lost 
	husband they have bases or bottoms that are buried sometimes up to three 
	feet into the ground. Therefore the cause of falling is that the stone is set too 
	close to the (eastern) front of the softer grave soil and they topple in as 
	the grave sinks. This is usually rare. In most cases the long type stone 
	breaks off. With investigation the only way you would <u>not know</u> there 
	was a stone there is that the breakage occurs at or below the ground level. 
	The top part in that case has toppled into the grave sink and become covered 
	in the sinking soil and debris. I find these sometimes and usually they are 
	no more than 4 inches below the surface. If the grave is on a side of a 
	slopping hill the top 
	sometimes falls and may slide down the hill over time and may no longer be near the 
	grave. That makes the stone or parts very hard to find especially if they 
	are covered in debris. Kids will pick up the parts and throw them further 
	away from the grave also. Also misguided relatives wanting to mark a grave 
	somewhere else in the cemetery will pick up parts of the stone and use them 
	to mark the grave of their relative who does not have a stone.<br>
	<br>
	When I get that familiar clink from the probe bumping the smooth stone at a 
	consistent depth is gotten&nbsp; I dig them out and set them back up. In rare cases the 
	fallen stone is deeper than 4 inches but in that case most times I miss them 
	because I don't probe much deeper than about 4 inches. If the stone top is 
	deeper than 4 inches it is probably lying in the grave sink. An even worse 
	scenerio 
	is for a tone covered up in a grave sink and a good Samaritan comes along 
	and fills up the 
	grave sink forever hiding most of the evidence of presence of the grave.</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I must add here off subject it is good 
	to get old limestone monuments back up from the soil. Leaving them on the 
	ground thus keeping them damp can cause the stone to crumble in the long run 
	and the closer to the surface the fallen stone is located the more danger of 
	crumbling there is. This is because the stone is then subjected to extremes 
	in changing temperatures of the weather, but if it is out of the ground 
	enough to dry quickly after rain then it is safer from the cracking that 
	could occur from being wet all the time. <br>
	<br>
	If the base is sticking out of the ground and next to a spouse's grave that 
	is your clue that the rest of the stone of the lost spouse is nearby. 
	However there are cases of the top of the stone missing because of vandals 
	stealing it. Another unfortunate event occurs when the stone was soft 
	(defective anyway) and the wet ground basically melted it away to never be 
	found again. Many times the stone crumbled because there was a forest fire 
	that burned it creating a softer stone that eventually begins to crumble 
	away. Sometimes you can find the crumbly parts still present but that 
	depends on the extent of the crumbling away. I am only referring to the old 
	soft limestone or sandstone type tan or gray monuments, because modern 
	granite monuments do not crumble though they can be broken by falling trees 
	and vandals.<br>
	<br>
	To make a grave probe get a 3 foot or more screw driver (found in specialty 
	hardware stores) and sharpen the end with a grinder by slowly rotating the 
	point against the side of a moving 3,000 RPM grinder, dipping the point in 
	cool water as you go to keep the steel from becoming brittle.&nbsp; This 
	sharpening process makes the tool 
	dangerously sharp on the end, so handle this with care, and of course use 
	protective gear to make this tool. You can fashion some kind of wax ball to 
	add to the point to make it less dangerous while not in use and also keep 
	the point sharp.</font><p class="MsoNormal">
	<font size="2">Maybe with a 
	little luck someone will uncover a stone which has been missing for a lost 
	member of a heritage search group. I know I have discovered several of them 
	in my time not listed in the cemetery books nor anywhere that I know of, but 
	sometimes the stone was just missed.<br>
