CEMETERY PHOTOGRAPHY - MAKING THE INSCRIPTION SHOW.</font></b></p>

  (1) Water can help but if the stone is splotchy in color or an old box tomb it 
  will not work in that case. It will also not work well in low light such as 
  the shade of trees. 
</div>
<div>
  <br>
  (2) Get your picture when the sun is shining across the face of the 
  inscription. Since most stones face east early in the morning is better. Be 
  careful to avoid casting your shadow on the stone though. A planned approach 
  is to go in the morning for eastern facing stones and go back at 2 in the 
  afternoon for western facing stones. That is about all of them as 99.9%&nbsp; 
  of the stones face one of those directions.</div>
<div>
  <br>
  (3) Take a tall mirror and hold that so the reflection of the sun shows up 
  across the face of the stone. This takes one person holding &amp; pointing the 
  mirror and one to photograph.&nbsp; Another form of this is to shine a bright 
	flash light across the face of the stone from an angle to bring out the 
	contrast.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  Preferred but the stones must be dry for this to work.</div>
<div>
  (4) Purchase a box or two of sidewalk pastel chalk at your favorite toy/craft 
	store and use it this way. 
  (a) On very dirty stones use a soft brush and brush away the lichen or soil 
	stains.&nbsp; (a) Next lay the chalk stick on its side and glide the chalk 
	softly over the inscription until 
	at lest the recessed inscription is covered. Less chalk is better usually. (b) Next take a flat kitchen sponge and smooth that 
	across the 
  flat surface using&nbsp;a couple of circular strokes slowly applied. Remember - do not over do it 
  - probably no more than two&nbsp;strokes at max. If you continue you will leave chalk 
  residue inside the inscription thus defeating your purpose. Since chalk 
  residue left in the inscription works against you blow it out or brush it out 
  with a small broom. If you did&nbsp;it right it should look like this: (this was a 
  gray-blue color chalk). For an air blast use a can of Computer Cleaner to 
	achieve the blast of air needed to clear the internal inscription of chalk.</div>

  <b>Never rub a stick of chalk over lettering that protrudes above the stone. 
  That could break off the lettering</b>. In this case rub the chalk into the 
  sponge and then rub that lightly over the lettering. <br>
  Use the lighter colors and pastel chalks and throw away the dark brilliant 
  colors as they show up strange looking in the&nbsp;photos. White is the better 
  color but only a few white sticks are included in the mix of a box so use the 
  white sticks first, then pastels (whitish blues, grays, browns etc)&nbsp;and then 
  go for another box at $1.97 per box. One box should cover about 50 stones 
  depending on the style stones. Remember the need for chalking is brought on by 
	the need to read old stones. 
  Modern Granite markers need nothing but a good photographer.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  A better sponge can be&nbsp;made by modifying an old sanding sponge. Take one that 
  is a cheaply made Chinese version that is well used and grind off or tear off the sanding grit and underlying black 
  coating. <b>NEVER USE A NEW/RAW SANDING GRIT SPONGE ON A STONE, you will destroy 
  its patination (time honored coloration) and do permanent harm! </b>&nbsp;Below the black coating is 
  left a very flat, soft&nbsp;&amp; smooth fine foam surface that&nbsp;provides a great medium to 
  smooth in the chalk on the inscription. If you are having a hard time grinding 
  off the grit layer lay the sponge&nbsp;on rough concrete and rub it in a circular 
  motion fiercely and that should peel it off. Use the cheap sanding blocks from 
  China at $.30 cents&nbsp;each. For those the grit &amp; coating peels off&nbsp;easily on 
  rough concrete such as your driveway or the side of your brick home. 
	Commercial grade Sanding sponges - American Made will not lose their grit 
	and coating easily enough to be used and they are about $3.00 apiece too, so 
	use the kitchen sponge if that is your choices.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  Remember if you get the grit off, but leave the smooth black undercoating on 
  the sponge it will work, but just not as well. It tends not to smooth in the 
  chalk as much, but with the grit gone it will not harm the stone. Also 
	the chalking procedure 
  will not work on wet stones. The stone must be dry or the sponge absorbs the 
  chalk. Another point is we are chalking the stone to make them readable and 
	nothing else as this does not improve the appearance of the stone in the 
	photo so do not use chalk if you don't have to.</div>

  This is a great outcome on an old box tombs that are hard to read:</div>

<div>
  Nelson Cem in Giles Co. using pastel yellow-green chalk to highlight the 
  inscription. Notice in this case I applied the chalk only to the inscription 
  and not over the entire area of the inscription. That was just to save time. 
  Really it looks better to cover the area evenly and have an even look. Our aim 
	is to bring out the inscription and not create beauty. It does not do that 
	so only chalk where you have to. Done 
  correctly the look should be almost natural and not loud or bold. I repeat do 
  not use the bright phosphoric colors such as bright reds or bright orange etc. 
  These are not historic looking and will show up in photos as dull looking, and 
  to me is just ugly. The chalk easily washes off with the first rain and leaves 
	no residue. The only precautionary note is this chalking method is not a 
	procedure that should be applied regularly on a stone, just as any cleaning 
	process. Over many times it could wear the stone to some degree more than 
	natural wear. I will say a stone should not be chalked more then once ever 
	ten years. </div>

  You can use the shaving cream method, but I have never used that. It is expensive 
  &amp; time consuming and requires a soft plastic smoothing trial to force the 
  cream into the inscription. The left over residue if not washed away can harm 
  the stone too. It sets up a acid based chemical residue that can do harm and 
  fertilize growing things to form on the stone surface rendering the stone 
  worse for reading over time.<p>I hesitated for many years in presenting the 
  above procedure. There are so many folks out there who are callous and 
  insist on altering any presentation given to them or they don't bother 
  to understand or follow instructions properly. This could do a lot of harm to the old soft stones. 
	Examples of that is using a magic marker inside an inscription to make it 
	black. <br>
	<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/Bringi3.jpg"><br>
	Samuel Crockett 1772 -1827 in the Andrew Crockett Cemetery. This is a 
	distorted inscription by a black magic marker or paint inside the 
	inscription. Cannot read the birth year at all, looks like 1732. Maybe they 
	even took a router and clumsily re-cut the lettering again in a very rough 
	way. Who knows. This is so ugly and never looks right again on a very 
	historic stone.<p>&nbsp;Remember some of these old stones are softer than a bar of soap. You will find 
  that out by breaking one of them if you are not careful. Remember be a jeweler 
  and work with softly applied precision and never be rough and forceful in dealing 
  with tombstones. If you have a handshake like a Philadelphia Lawyer chances 
	are you are too strong to use any of thes methods. This procedure is a delicate art &amp; difficult when dealing with an 
  100-800 
  pound stone. I am convinced there are folks among us who are incapable of 
  that by their nature. But what ever you do follow this additional advise:<p>Do not use 
  wire brushes on stones except to clean the (breakage) joints prior to epoxy gluing them 
	back together.<br>
  Do not use sanding mediums (blocks, paper, etc.) on stones.<br>
  A good test to tell if a brush is soft enough is to rub the bristles across 
  the back of your hand. If it hurts don't use it on the stone.<br>
  Never use anything with acids or alkali on a stone. For instance never use 
	Muriatic Acid or Lye or Clorox<br>
  Clorox and other bleaches leave a residue that will breakdown into harmful 
  substances unless flushed away thoroughly with water immediately after use.<br>
	Also never touch the inside of an inscription. All the above procedures 
	touch only the surface of the stone. If you see a big flake of lichen covering 
	the inscription just whisk it way with your finger or the soft brush.<br>
	Caution: Do not find yourself downwind of the chalking process. There is a 
	dusty residue stirred up in the process of gliding the chalk over the stone. 
	You can get C.O.P.D. in the long run if you breath chalk dust enough. </div>
