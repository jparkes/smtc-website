Memorial Restoration Procedures</p>



<P><u>Problem #1 -&nbsp; The old style 2-4 inch thick stone that is
leaning badly as shown here:</br>
</u>&nbsp;



<center>&nbsp;</center>





<left>The task here is to return the stone
back to an upright position instead of leaving it the bad lean shown that is here. Such a lean will
eventually cause the stone to fall. Never just walk up to a stone and attempt to
pressure it into an upright position. The stone will likely break at the base
and fall. If it does not fall the loosening of the soil around the base will
surely cause it to fall later even if you do succeed in getting it into an upright
position. This procedure applies to the old stones which are usually set deeply 
into the ground sometimes as much as 3 feet. The stone should not be set upright 
unless it is leaning so badly it is danger of falling or being hit by 
maintenance equipment. But in that case it has to be complete dug down to the 
base and leveled and filled a little soil at a time and tamped as you fill 
making sure it is secure in a level position. This application applies usually 
to old stone prior to 1860.</br>

The ston<img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/restoreleaningstone.jpg" align="left" width="205" height="300">e in this 
next example is not as old and has a base. It must be leveled and set in at least one 40 lb bag of quickset
concrete
to keep it upright. If the stone is loose at the joint from the base two or more bags will be
required to cover the base and the main part of the stone which fits into the base.&nbsp;</br>
&nbsp;The tools needed for the above repair are as follows: Carpenter's level, a
shovel and a rake, plastic pail for mixing the concrete. enough
water for one or two 40 lb bags of concrete.&nbsp;</br>
The materials needed are: one or two bags of quickset concrete, enough water to
mix two 40 lb bags of quick set concrete and of course water for cleanup.</br>
</br>
To begin this repair first rake the area around the base clean to get at the base and
soil. If there is another stone there then be certain it is left or replaced in the
exact position that it was before because chances are that it is&nbsp; an
unmarked grave stone that is out of place and since you will be unaware where it
belongs be sure to leave it where it was and in the same position. The soil is pulled back from the base for about a two square foot area or
enough to be able to position the stone upright and level. This may require digging
out as much as the top 4&quot; or more of soil with the shovel depending on how
deep the stone is set. When enough soil is removed to free up the stone then straighten
it up taking care not to
stress the base joints by applying too much pressure to the straightening
effort. If the stone is loose from the base and moves back and forth you
will need to set the bottom of the stone into concrete thereby replacing the sloppy base
joint. If the base is tight against the stone and it becomes clear that the stone
still cannot be straightened by a small
amount of effort then dig out more soil and try again. Repeat this until the base is loosened
enough to be straightened. At this point now we can stand the stone upright for
sure. Using the carpenters level check and adjust the stone
accordingly to get the stone standing perfectly upright so that it no longer
leans toward the ground. The above stone is that of Golman Martin 1830 - 1861.
It rests in the Shane Cemetery and belongs to a
Civil War casualty known as Goldman L. Martin whose inscription is also found on the Memorial Wall
dedicated to the War Dead in Columbia Tennessee. You will find it across the
street from the 11th president, James K. Polk's childhood home.
Notice that the stone is thicker at the bottom than the top.
So the use of a level will be a bit tricky. One will need to be certain the outage
on the level gauge is the same on the front measure as that on the backside assuming
the taper is the same on the front and back of the stone. Be sure to check the plumb upright from two corners to
guarantee&nbsp; the stone is upright and not leaning back to the front or to the
side. After the leveling is complete a bag of quickset concrete is then mixed and poured into the dug out
area around the base to secure the stone. (Warning; the Sons of Confederate
Veterans do not recommend the use of concrete in setting old stones. Mix another bag of quickset concrete
if that is needed and apply that but be certain the concrete is well below the
frost line and far away from any inscription so it does not negatively impact
the stones long term survival. When finished check the level again and
rake the soil back
into place to cover the base of the stone as it was before. Be sure to tamp the
soil around the base to prevent the stone from falling in the future. One
can do that by walking on the spot or using the end of the shovel handle to pack
the soil.&nbsp;</br>
You may
need to modify the instruction above for a stone that was set very shallow into the
ground. In such a situation dig it up and set the stone base deeper into the ground than it
was before.&nbsp; At the opposite spectrum when the stone is set abnormally deep
into the ground it may need to be dug up and set in place with less depth. So
just modify your procedures as needed according to the depth of the
stone. If you move the stone be sure you line it up in the same place it was
before. Old cemeteries rarely have perfect rows for the graves and memorials.
Clustering families in group burials was more important to our ancestors than
perfect order. However in many cases the stones have been unknowingly relocated
by caretakers and cemetery restoration crews. This may give the appearance
that the rows are less than perfect when in some cases they were located
according to&nbsp; an original
survey. But, nevertheless put it back where you found it and facing the same
direction unless you are absolutely sure that a change in location will put the
stone where it was originally located.</br>
