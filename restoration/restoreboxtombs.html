<div style="float: left">
  <p align="left">The below fix is especially difficult
  because of so many different memorials and pieces of memorials being involved.
  We
will try to tackle the how to of this difficult repair but be aware that it cannot be made
  perfect again because there are so many unknowns that it is not possible to
  address them all.
  Unknowns such as all the places each stone originally belonged. There are a
  lot of clues to the repair and we will tackle these and we can make an
  improvement that will be significant to the historical preservation and beauty
  of the cemetery. At first
glance we see only a bunch of scattered broken rock and some very large slabs and
  what appears to be one complete box tomb largely complete.  Looking closely we actually see parts
of six box tombs in various broken stages and possibly some unmarked field
stones. Here we will explore
ways to reassemble the broken box tombs. To begin with we must document in place
each broken piece before proceeding to move the parts back to be supported and
  reset in their
original places. Nothing will be disturbed until we have a map or drawing of
where each part is now and where it will be relocated. <img align="left" border="0" height="362" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/../greenwoodcemetery/greenwoodview3.jpg" width="485"/>
  Also remember you have stones here that weigh from 25 to 700 pounds and any
  movement of a stone in the above scenario without assessing its place in the
  precarious balance of stones may bring a 700 lb rock tumbling down on you. So
  know what you are doing before tackling a project such as this. We do not have
  space for describing all the ways and means of safely handling large stones
  over 50 lbs so you will need to develop that methodology. That will take an
  ability to handle them without banging them around and breaking them even more
  and the main thing not getting yourself hurt. I will tell you it involves the use of special hoist that are cheap
  enough to build or purchase. These are known as Tripods. 
	Tripods
  for cemetery restoration use vary from wooden "A"
  frame type capable of lifting up to two tons to the three pole steel I-beams
  frame that will support up to about five tons. <br/>
  Upon first surveying the disarray above one should see the following categories of
  possible stones:<br/>
  1. Parts of box tomb including the main inscribed carved top, the box tomb
  sides, the end slabs.<br/>
  2. Field stones that  mark nearby graves that are misplaced and left on
  top of the box tombs or nearby ground.<br/>
  3. Field stones that serve only as fillers of the box tomb cavity. <br/>
  4. Other carved grave stones including misplaced footstones that actually may belong in another row
  of graves somewhere. <br/>
 Your first task is to identify each box tomb
  part to the respective tomb that it belongs. That is because these are the
  easiest parts to match up and will clear from the debris field many of the
  scattered parts making the rest of the task easier. You may use a digital camera and photograph each stone in place without moving any of
  them or just use old fashioned drawing paper and pencils.
  Make a corresponding record of each photograph numbering the stones for
  tracking purposes. For labeling purposes we can use the criteria as detailed
  here:<br/>
  BTLS-Box tomb Left side Slab<br/>
  BTRS-Box tomb Right side Slab<br/>
  BTTOP-Box tomb Top<br/>
  BTFE-Box tomb Front End Slab<br/>
  BTRE-Box tomb Rear End Slab <br/>
  Note on site whether the stone is a part of a box tomb or field stone and try to classify
  the stones according to the above 1 - 4 classes. Note also the approximate age
  the stone might have been in the place where you find it. For example stones
  that have been lying in place many years are embedded in the ground deeper
  than ones lying on top. Stones lying on the box tombs for many years leave
  light colored spots where the mosses and lichens don't grow. That explains the
  light white spots in the pictures here. Clean stones are
  probably ones that have been moved or turned upside down where the mosses and
  lichens don't grow, but they might have also been buried below the ground and
  were dug up and placed on the box tomb top. It takes a few years for the 
	untouched mosses and lichens to grow on
  a stone. Mosses will also grow on stones more protected
  from the sun though lichens will grow more where there is sunlight and
  moisture. Mostly these thoughts apply to the southeast where I am familiar with the
  plant biology of the wetter climates. That growth will
  give them the blackish/brownish molted look. The stone itself will age and change
  color over time but that is usually not noticeable is called patination. This process takes a
  1,000 years for notable changes related to age to occur. That is at least for
  the hard types of stone used in memorials. Limestone, sandstone and
  marble can change quickly when subjected to the UV rays of the sun.<br/>
  Deeply embedded fieldstones that are in the grave rows should be left alone,
  because chances are great they are grave markers or grave boundary
  markers. Even if you think you know don't guess at where anything might
  have been positioned.
  From this  information one can begin to conclude and make a record of the
  approximate age in place for each stone. You have it numbered and know its
  exact location. You can now make a drawing of where each stone will
  belong in the new order. Don't expect to know all of them just do the ones that
  are sure bets like you would on a Jig Saw puzzle. <br/>
  Your task when the recording and logging phase is done will be to begin
  reassembly of the box tomb parts. You might consider setting the broken sides in concrete at
  the bottom but be certain the concrete is not visible but below ground. This will hold the 
	sides assuming there is not a flat base for them to set on. All four sides 
	should be leveled nicely for the top to rest on. It becomes
  very tricky if one side slab is broken into lets say 10 pieces. Then you can 
	and should use the approved epoxy gluing process to support the pieces. A 
	box tomb part standing up can be glued whereas a top that is broken will 
	collapse if you try to glue that because of the compounded weight on the 
	glued joints. Go to the section on repairing
  broken stones and develop that knowledge. To repair broken tops one will need
  to use a combination of unseen supports installed inside the box to
  make that stand up correctly. When there is multiple breaks in a stone think of
  putting the parts together as you would a jig saw puzzle and the task will become
  less challenging. <br/>
  The preliminary layout below begins to show you how and where
  some of the missing parts are to be relocated back to their respective spots.
  To make the below image I used a large 2272 x 1704 or 5 mega-pixel digital
  photo and viewed and labeled the parts and then resized the photo back down to
  a standard 640 x 480 size that can be published. You can use the same method
  to document some of the biggest parts into their respective places. To do all
  of this from the photos you will
  need to take shots from several angles to aid you in eliminating the normal
  distortion that occurs from a photo in sizing or judging stone parts. So the
  best approach is to use a combination of drawings and photos.  I cannot 
	show you the finished product because I did not see it nor actually do this 
	repair.<b><br/>
