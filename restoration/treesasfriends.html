<p align="center"><b>A
CEMETERY RESTORATION- THE NATURE OF SOUTHERN TREES.</b></p>

<center>Trees are a tall
subject in cemeteries because they can destroy a cemetery or enhance its lasting
ability and offer beauty for the visitor. We will address this subject using a knowledge of
the Southeastern Forest.
This will yield a information base for trees in old southern
cemeteries but may be generally applicable in other areas of the country.&nbsp; Trees come in all kinds and are either a friend to the
cemetery or a nuisance that can destroy the memorials and penetrate the graves
destroying the interred remains. </br>
</br>
<u>As a Foe of the Cemetery</br>
</u>It is critical that trees be controlled in all cemeteries especially the old family
cemeteries where they tend to spring up unchecked. Uncontrolled growth can result 
in the following problems</br><u></br>
</u>1. Their roots enlarge and move the stone bases rendering the memorials out of level and
causing them to fall. </br>
2. They feed off of the nutrients of the decomposition of the grave remains if allowed
to grow near the graves. The softer soil from grave refill allows for
penetration by the tree roots enhancing the possibility of an
unchecked tree growing into the grave. Especially in old cemeteries where the deceased was not
interred in a protective metal container. </br>
3. Trees grow large and shed limbs in the storms and wet season. Storms cause the
limbs or whole trees to come
smashing down the memorials knocking them down and breaking them
because no one bothered to Check their growth. There are some differentce 
between the mighty Oaks and
Cedars and the invasive Black Cherry &amp; Hackberry that have such a short,
brittle &amp; brutal life. However all trees can be detrimental to gravestones 
as evidenced by recent tornados in northern Alabama. In the tornados of 27 Apr 
2011 there is a case in the Andrews Cemetery in Limestone County Alabama of 
large Oak tree falling away from the stone but in the process the root ball 
lifted into the air causing a deep hole. This caused the monument which was 
sitting near the tree base to tumble four feet into the gapping hole opened by 
the fallen tree roots. This monument would have disappeared underground in time 
as the root ball of the tree dissolved back into the hole filling around &amp; 
covering the stone. In that case I used a tripod to lift the stone back to the 
surface but did not salvage the base because it was mired upside down into the 
remains of the deceased.</br>
Tornados generally cause the trees to fall mostly to the west but severe ones 
will cause them to fall north or even south. So large trees should always be 
planted on the east side of graves and then far enough away (abt 10 feet east) 
so that if they fall they the root ball will not affect the monument.&nbsp;</br>
</br>
<u>As a friend of the Cemetery</br>
</u>Trees can also be a friend of the cemetery serving in the following ways to
enhance the beauty and protection of the memorials from the harsh elements of
nature.</br>
Proper placement or allowing the proper trees to grow in selected places
causes a protective canopy to form over the graves and stones and yields generally a cleaner more
readable memorial stone that is free of lichens and mosses. The tree will
shelter the stones from the harsh elements of nature and keep them dryer and
cleaner if they are the proper kind. The placement of the trees must be a safe
distance away and always east from the graves so they don't fall on the memorials in a storm.&nbsp; </br>
We should
discuss the kinds of trees that are best suited for cemeteries in the southeast
around Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Mississippi and perhaps Louisiana and
parts of Texas and the western part of the Carolinas. We should include here the
nature and a rating of the suitability of each type of tree for our purposes of
providing beauty and shelter for old historical family cemeteries.</br>
It is generally understood that small ornamental and evergreen trees make the
best covers and offer the most beauty in cemeteries granted the evergreens are 
softer wood. Since our subject is small
historical cemeteries our task is more of a selection process than deciding which
trees to plant. This is because most small cemeteries are not
provided with a well established restoration and maintenance force. It could
be as simple as a farmer or land owner deciding which trees should be left to
grow freely in a nearby cemetery on their premises. Let us now rate the trees
that grow native to the south granted some of these trees may not be prevalent
in your area depending largely on the topography. </br>
Red Cedar - Rated a 9. My favorite native tree is perhaps the old common Red
Cedar. It will stand a hundred years or sometimes much more and when it dies will stand another
hundred years without falling on the stones. This is because of the rot proof
durability of the wood. When it does finally fall it is dry and light and does a
minimum of damage to the stones. There are only two drawbacks One is that Red Cedar does not
produce a large canopy and the shade is therefore not as widespread. Also the 
Cedar is a softwood and storms tend to damage it more easily than the hardwoods. I rate the Red Cedar a
7 with 10 being the
best and 0 being the worst. </br>
Black, Water or Willow Oak - Rated a 0. I would rate the worst tree to be the
Black, Water or Willow Oak. This class of Oaks grow swiftly and generally matures to a
three foot trunk in fifty years. They constantly shed very large limbs being very
brittle. They are subject to many diseases shortening their lives and are unsuitable for cemeteries.&nbsp;Another
tree the Weeping Willow is also prone to shed limbs and grows &amp; dies fast so
I will also rate it a 0.&nbsp; </br>
Red Oak- Rated a 4. These trees grow fast and strong but are a bit brittle and
massive and have a few diseases but mature quickly and die within one to two
hundred years depending on the nutrients of the surrounding soil.&nbsp;&nbsp; </br>
Chestnut and other types of white Oak - Rated a 6. These can grow massive and are pretty strong with many
of them rotting on the stump before falling after living a long life of 200 to
300 years. They are only a problem because of
the tremendous size of the limbs which may endanger anything below them.</br>
Black Cherry is also unsuitable as it grows fast and falls easily by storms onto the stones and has a short &amp; brutal life. 
<p>
Bowdak - Rated a 10 and a 4. The old common Bowdak is about the ugliest tree of
them all but it is like the Red Cedar in that it hardly ever sheds limbs to fall on
the stones. It is ugly because it grows in a gnarled manner hardly ever straight
and with many dead lower branches with small thorns on them which never fall
away. This is the tree the American Indians used to make their bows and is 
strong and hard as a rock. It will reduce a chain saw to mush if you are so 
brave as to try to cut one. I think if it were planted and nurtured so it would 
grow strait. It then could become an enhanced addition to any cemetery due to 
its deep canopy, strength. Down side is the ugly green fruit that is shed in the 
late summer is there and will attract Opossums in large numbers.</br>
American Holly - Rated an 8 This is another of my favorite trees in cemeteries
because it can live a long life and grow massive in size and provide a great
year round cover for the stones without falling on them.&nbsp;</br>
