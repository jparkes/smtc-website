<center><b>KERR, William, died 2 Dec 1853. 
(Age 72 yrs.; b. 1781 in Orange Co., N.C.; mar. lst, Kate Ross.&nbsp;</br>
This stone is broken and as of 7/6/2002 was shattered into hundreds of parts, The above is a photo of the partially reassembled
stone is a computer generated graphic image made by taking a photo of the stone
and adding the known lettering that gives the appearance of an partial
restoration. The actual stone was then an assembly of hundreds of parts
glued &amp; set together to create the illusion of completeness. I used Epoxies, Concrete and the latest UV resistant plastic
fillers, In spite of my efforts the stone will probably need to be replaced very
soon, probably within 10 years. One can read here most of the epitaph that reflects traditional stone work which
once graced the Shane Cemetery in Campbell Station with William's deeply
religious faith. It says: &quot;SACRED TO the memory of WILLIAM KERR, died Dec 2nd 1853. Aged 72 YEARS. 
Princes this clay must be your bed In spite of all your towers; The tall, the
wise, the reverend head Must lie as low as ours&quot; Our thanks to Laura
Lewallen a Kerr descendent who lives in Texas as a result of a Kerr migration
about 1870. She knew the complete poem &amp; I will share her
thoughtfulness:&nbsp;</br>
</br>
</b><u><b>A
funeral thought.</br>
</b></u></br>
<b>Hark! from the tombs
a doleful sound;</br>
My ears, attend the cry;</br>
&quot;Ye living men, come view the ground</br>
Where you must shortly lie.</br>
</br>
&quot;Princes, this clay must be your bed,</br>
In spite of all your towers;</br>
The tall, the wise, the rev'rend head</br>
Must lie as low as ours!&quot;</br>
</br>
Great God! is this our certain doom?</br>
And are we still secure?</br>
Still walking downward to our tomb,</br>
And yet prepare no more?</br>
Grant us the powers of quick'ning grace,</br>
To fit our souls to fly,</br>
Then, when we drop this dying flesh,</br>
We'll rise above the sky.</br>
</br>
I do not know the author of this poem but it has been around at least since
1825. The first part of it is inscribed and dated 1825 in the Reese's Church
Cemetery on the stone entrance gate post.</b><p>

<b>I made up a temporary
</b><b>temporary
Marble marker put in place
while the William Kerr stone was being repaired. I simply used&nbsp;mylar lettering
and common floor marble slabs that can be purchased at any home repair store. I
would advise you to use traditional funeral markers for this. They can be
purchased for a reasonable price or your local funeral director might donate you
one.&nbsp;</br>
It is
obvious we had to scratch around in the earth to find what remains of the surface
face of
the stone containing the inscription. We were only able to locate about 80% of
the parts that contained the inscription.</b>

<b>This picture is from a low
resolution image made with a VHS Camcorder in 1992. The stone was fallen on
the ground at that time but was still readable and contained most of the lettering.
The low resolution and blades of
grass hanging across the face makes this hard to read. &nbsp;</b><p><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/../kerr-williamdscf0026.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p><b>This is what I found
in June 2002. It appears to me a portion of the damage is from a lawn mower
running over the face of the stone. Opps, folks be careful while mowing there are other
stones at risk. As you can see the
face containing all the lettering has peeled away. The pieces I found were scattered over a large
area of about 20 square feet. The rest of the stone was also breaking up in layers
and must be set in
cement to be even temporarily repaired. &nbsp;</b><p><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration/../kerr_williamgraphicstone.jpg" width="420" height="480"></p>

<b>Aw, the power of the
computer! This is a computer graphic rendition of what I believe the stone would
have looked like 50+ years ago. This is complete and set with the real background
showing the Claborn Taylor Memorial on the right and various other stones on the
right and left. We are looking south. Most of the grass in the lower portion is
copied. It is exact to the best of my ability to replicate the way a photo would
have looked taken from the original stone some sixty to a hundred years ago.
That was before the stone broke at the base and fell. All the Cemetery
publications I have seen mention the stone as broken including &quot;Cemeteries
of Maury County Tennessee&quot; by Fred Hawkins. The detail regarding the type of
stone was replicated from the photo of the remaining parts of the original stone
thus maintaining the color.&nbsp;</br>
 Had the original been better cleaned this image would
have shown up actually as more tan-gray granite. Though I believe the original
stone to be a hard limestone and not granite. The reddish and green shades are
from the various Molds and Lichens that grow and live on stone over time.&nbsp;</br>
 In the
finished product I repainted the lettering green to match the lichen color.&nbsp;</br>
 The lichen and
molds actually form a protective barrier from hail and ultraviolet rays of the
Sun. The background area for the photo is approximate. The angle of the light is
approximate because that was extracted from another photo taken at about the same
position. Background trees were made from the trees on the left and right from a
northward position of the photo and reproduced over a larger area yielding some
distortion in exactness there. The same could be said about the summer grass.
One can see some of the other background stones from about the same angle as if
a reproduction were taken of the fallen and shaled stone in the same position in Shane
Cemetery. The stone of William's 2nd wife and his daughter are on the right and
left but were not presented here due to the close up recapture.&nbsp;Some of
the lettering was made by copying like kind letters where they were
needed to complete the inscription. I should repeat that the known proven
lettering is shown on the first image on this page above. The rest was my my
opinion and is known to be incorrect thanks to cousin Laura Lewallen of Texas
who graciously provided the complete poem &quot;A funeral thought&quot;&nbsp;</b>

<b>Pictured here is the actual
stone as it looks after the restoration. It was photographed just
after resetting it in the cemetery. The large green area in the center was a
mistake with a can of paint in one of the many fractures in the stone and will
weather away shortly along with the green color of the lettering. Only Bondo was
used where the lettering was lost completely and we knew the inscription. These
are the pinkish areas in the upper left area. The temporary marble
marker was attached with cement just in case it outlasts the original. </br></br><u>The
state of memorial in recent finds and the nature of the breakup of the stone</u></br>
Status of this stone in 1992 was good. The stone was only broken at the base and
had a minor portion of the epitaph at the bottom broken away. That was enough to
fuel a debate between myself and my sister as what the religious epitaph stated. The
stone was lying on the ground and buried even with the top of the ground. The
top was pointing south. Normally it is not bad for a stone to lie on the
ground. The constant temperature of the earth tends to slow the contraction and
expansion caused by the temperature fluctuations. It is this temperature
fluctuation and the pounding of the weather elements which can break down the
stone's inner materials over time. A visit there in 1995 found about the same
status with the fragmentation accelerating. A recent visit in 2002 found no
readable lettering at all. The
face containing all the lettering was broken into hundreds of pieces and scattered
over a wide area. I am sure there
are missing ones further out, but I could not find them. Evidence abounded that
a lawn mower had accelerated the breakup by mowing over the face of the stone.
The final breakup of the stone probably happened because the lawn mower continuously
rolled over the face of the stone jarring loose the top layer of the stone which
was already soft from natural shaling. I am sure this process was also accelerated by ice &amp; heat from water. When frozen
by the winter water
contracts the stone with a corresponding opposite expansion of the stone from the summer heat. This constant contraction and expansion
aided the
dismantling of the stone face into hundreds of fragments.&nbsp;</b> 




<p>

<b><u>  The slow tedious
process of an attempted restoration</u>  </br>I visited there June 15, 2002 and collected all the
fragments I could find from the face of the stone and began the jig saw puzzle
effort of matching, reassembling, cleaning, and gluing the parts back together.
The original stone without the face was left in place on the ground until a
later date. The first phase was to be the reassembling of the front plate
containing the lettering. Later I went there and collected as many of the
remaining parts of the stone as could be found. This included shallow digging of
a
couple of inches for any buried ones. I left a makeshift temporary marble plate
marker with the vital stone information to serve as a memorial in the interim.
All the parts were re-matched &amp; bonded together using the latest forms of silicones
and epoxies. It will be a success if the reassembled stone is as near the
original as possible. I make no guarantees but the complete stone now has
about 85% of the lettering intact and 70% of the face reattached compared to
nothing before. I have reconstructed the missing vital parts with BONDO, a super
hard plastic, and aided with gray epoxy putty. The toughest task was re-cutting
the missing letters with a router and DREMEL tool using Titanium and Diamond
bits. Though I am not a skilled
stone cutter I was able to make it look fairly realistic using a Sears letter template
tool. After all the parts that were
available was reinstalled the stone was set at an angle in a cast of colored
Concrete Cement. The best to use in this repair is the super strong hydraulic
Cement. When dry the stone was coated with a layer of water repellent stone
cement. The angle should cause gravity to help hold the many parts in place if the
breakup starts again.&nbsp;The stone looks realistic but a pit splotchy and is largely readable but
I have no idea how long the silicones, plastics, epoxy
fillers &amp; adhesives will last. The strength of the adhesives will be greater
than the original stone, but, that does not mean that they will weather better
in time. I find no one who has the experience to inform me as
to how long this procedure will last. Because of the impossible task of
filling all the minute crevices and cracks with permanent materials, I am
not optimistic for the stone's survival for the long haul. However as you can
see I could not resist the intense effort required to attempt this difficult
feat. I think it is more like the original than any granite marker I could have
installed there. Probably water will eventually seep
back in and start the expansion and contraction again causing the cracking process
to renew.&nbsp;</br>
 So lets recoup what you saw above. 1. The actual and graphical
partially restored stone photo made on 9/30/2002.&nbsp; 2. A Marble temporary
marker left at the grave site to serve as a memorial until the stone is
reset.&nbsp; 3. The stone as it was found in the Summer of 1992.&nbsp; 4. The
shattered stone as it was found on the ground on 7/5/2002 void of any lettering. 5. The graphical
restored stone using the computer to give the illusion of completeness 10/15/02.
6. The restored stone as it looks now after restoration and now back in the
Cemetery 6/11/2003.</br>
