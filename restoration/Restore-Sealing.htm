CEMETERY CLEANING &amp; CARE - MAKING THE STONE CLEAN AND LASTING.</font></b></p>

  The first order of business is to clean the stone of living &amp; dead matter 
	before we can begin to add the sealing compound. There are several approved 
	mixes of biodegradable substrates that are approved to use as often as once 
	every 5 years. The substance is coated onto the stone and a black plastic 
	bag is then put over the stone to finish killing the living matter on the 
	stone. A simple deviation of this is to add a black plastic bag over the 
	stone for a couple of months and the living matter and stains will 
	disappear, because most of that is living matter which will die without 
	light and air. Any remaining stain can be washed away with water. Remember 
	all plants need light water and air to remain healthy. Deprived of any one 
	of those and the lichens and mosses that cling so easily to the stone will 
	die and fall off. Care should be taken so as to avoid cleaning with 
	detergents that contain compounds like sodium bicarbonate (baking Soda), 
	sodium chloride (Salt), sodium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, and tri-sodium 
	phosphate. You can prepare a homemade poultice by mixing equal parts of 
	water and vegetable glycerin (actually used in skin care) in dry porcelain 
	clay until you get a smooth consistency. after application and use any of 
	these compounds should be flushed thoroughly afterward to remove any 
	residue.<br>

	An example of a non-ionic cleaner which can be safely used to clean 
	headstones. Use with lots of water afterward.<p>A approved approach to sealing old cracked monuments which are found in many 
	old graveyards is to use an approved mix of 2 parts white Type N mortar white 
	concrete mix. The white concrete mix is hard to find and expensive. I am 
	told by concrete manufacturers that Type N mortar mix which comes in a gray 
	color could be substituted, but don't tell Dan Sumner Allen IV President of 
	Cumberland Research Group. HA! It is the 
	same chemical composition, but is gray in color. Add to that 4 parts of 
	(white) Hydrated Lime purchased from any concrete supply store and then add 8 parts 
	white sand. Children's' play sand is good because the color is lighter, 
	it is finer, and is not made of crushed glass to break your hands out. Mix 
	all that together in the volume needed and add water and mix until it 
	becomes a soupy mix in your mixing container. <br>
	Of course stir the mix until it is thoroughly blended and a bit on the 
	slushy side. After putting on your rubber gloves gather up a handful of the 
	mix and smear it across the face of the stone into the cracks and then all 
	over the stone being sure it is pressed into the cracks and crevices. Do a 
	good job here because this part is very critical to the success of the 
	effort. You should notice it is filling all the small cracks if you are 
	doing a good job and have added the right amount of water to the mix . If 
	there is a large crevice somewhere on the stone then use the mix in thicker 
	form to fill the crevice with more of a solid material. Next let the applied 
	stone dry for a few minutes then with a common garden sprayer filled with 
	common water and&nbsp; pumped up gently wash the surface of the stone to be 
	sure you clear any residual matter inside the inscription and other places 
	the material may have become too concentrated. <br>
	You may be be sure this procedure will continue to allow water to seep into 
	the stone and run thru its porous surfaces, but it slows down that process. 
	Allowing the water to seep into the stone and not becoming trapped so that 
	the heating and cooling of the stone occurs in an even matter based on 
	having the same level of moisture inside the contents of the stone at all 
	times. This is key to 
	keeping the stone healthy long term. Sealing the stone is a misnomer as we 
	never want to technically seal the stone and prevent it pores from allowing 
	water to exit its content. </p>

	<b>This stone for Rezin Smith b. 1787-1851&nbsp; found in the Richmond 
	Cemetery in Bedford County Tennessee is a typical example of a stone that 
	will benefit from cleaning and sealing with the above procedures. Notice 
	some living stains are reddish in color and others brownish. The main face 
	of the stone has blackish mold on it. Any unapproved methods of sealing a 
	stone is unacceptable and will do more harm than good in the long term. <br>
	<br>
	</b>Do not use any of the following:<br>
	(1) Commercial Concrete sealer as found in the hardward store. (2) Deck 
	Sealer. These products or any others will cause the stone to retain water in 
	varying amounts at different places on the stone. This varying retention 
	sets up the stone for damage from heating and expansion and drying in the 
	elements of nature.<br>
