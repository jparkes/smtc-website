<b>This Topozone map shows where the
cemetery is supposed to be. Mr. Fred Hawkins described it as on &quot;Childress
Hill&quot; in 1986. The basis of this map was developed in the 1940s or early
1950s by USGS and TVA later.</b></br>

This aerial view shows the place where I believe this cemetery was located at the time
the mapping location was activated. I am placing the mapping coordinate approximately in
the place
where (1940's) early map makers say the cemetery was located and I make no guarantees that is
where it was or may be found today. Notice the cars on
I-65 on your left. This is not clear enough to see a small tombstone. Large ones
show up though.<i></br>
