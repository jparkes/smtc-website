This aerial view shows the place where I believe this cemetery was located at the time
the mapping location was activated. I am placing the mapping coordinate approximately in
the place
where (1940's) early map makers say the cemetery was located and I make no guarantees that is
where it was or may be found today. Notice the cars on
I-65 on your left. This is not clear enough to see a small tombstone. Large ones
show up though.</font><font color="#000080" size="2"><i><br>
