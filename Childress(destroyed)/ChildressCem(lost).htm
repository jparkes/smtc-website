65 about 162 yards west of a center line between the north and south beds of the
Highway. It is
also about 100 yards south of Rutherford Creek. There is some error in my calculation, but I am unaware
if it is major or more than 20 feet. </b></font><a href="ChildressCemMaps.htm">

Mr. Fred says this in 1986:</u><br>
&quot;Shown on T.V.A. map as being located near the point where Rutherford Creek
crosses 1-65. It is on what was once known as &quot;Childress Hill&quot;. The
cemetery has long been abandoned and has now been destroyed.&quot; <i>Fred
Hawkins 26 Nov 1986.</i><br>
<u><br>
Commentary 26 Jan 2009:</u><br>
I have not examined the location where the included maps are pointing as being
where this cemetery was located, but for several years prior to the growth of 
vegetation the site was visible from I-65 and I could never see any evidence of 
a cemetery from there. I do not make any judgment on what is actually
there, but the spot marked by USGS was in an open field. These coordinates are based on the longitude and latitude of the United
States Geological Survey Mapping and upgrades by Tennessee Valley Authority and 
may have some degree of error.
