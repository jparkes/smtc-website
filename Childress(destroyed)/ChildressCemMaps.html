<b>This Topozone map shows where the
cemetery is supposed to be. Mr. Fred Hawkins described it as on "Childress
Hill" in 1986. The basis of this map was developed in the 1940s or early
1950s by USGS and TVA later.</b><br/>

This aerial view shows the place where I believe this cemetery was located at the time
the mapping location was activated. I am placing the mapping coordinate approximately in
the place
where (1940's) early map makers say the cemetery was located and I make no guarantees that is
where it was or may be found today. Notice the cars on
I-65 on your left. This is not clear enough to see a small tombstone. Large ones
show up though.<i><br/>
