CEMETERY, (Carters Creek) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

This topographical
map shows the GPS Coordinates of the Blackman Cemetery.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"><br/>

</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: navy">This aerial view of the cemetery shows the
cemetery in a dense thicket of trees between two houses at the end of a Cul De
Sac. The road name is Autumn Lane but the map draws Autumn Lane too far south in
error by about 200 yards of the actual road location. Mapquest is the only
mapping service I noticed that corrected this error.<br/>

In Spring Hill turn west on Beechcroft Road (Hwy 247), and go about 5 miles. At
the junction of Carters Creek Pike &amp; Beechcroft Road turn north (right) and
go 1 mile and turn back left into Autumn Lane. This historic cemetery is at the
end of Autumn Lane on the left in a thicket between two houses.<br/>
<u><br/>
Another finder's perspective</u><br/>
1987: On west side of Carter's Creek Rd. halfway between Dodson Road and
Robertson Road. In field beside old C. D. Latta home. (Don't believe the Latta
Home is there anymore, 2009)Â <br/>
<br/>
2009: Today the cemetery can actually be found in a subdivision in a Cul De Sac
between two houses. Go north on Hwy 31 left on Carters Creek Pike. Travel that
about 8 or 9 miles and turn left into Autumn Lane. The cemetery will be on the
left down at the end of Autumn Lane between two nice houses still maintained as
an infested thicket.<br/>
