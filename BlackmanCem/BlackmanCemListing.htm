<p><u>Death notice of a relative</br>
</u>BLACKMAN, Col. Albert Livingston, 'well known promoter and industrial agent,
died this morning in Nashville; born in Maury County 57 yrs. ago.; member of 4th Tenn
Cavalry.&quot;
(Daily Herald, 3 Sep 1902.) [No evidence from this he is interred here in this
cemetery. - W.A. 2009]</p>
<p>Few cemeteries, especially those of such historic Importance, have been so
abandoned as has this one. Large trees have fallen, dislocating grave stones and
vines and bushes
cover everything. The rock wall has fallen in many places. [F.L.H. 1987.]&nbsp;</br>
Not much change since then, but nice manicured lawns all around. It is weird to me that
people are benign about change in that that &quot;what was there will continue to be, as it was the last
100 years a grown up thicket. Now it is in the midst of a nice subdivision.
I say community minded people folks clean it up and make the repairs to the stones and
make a nice little historic park of the cemetery.&nbsp;These people helped win
your freedoms you have today. [W.A. 2009]</br>
</br>
Noted in the book They Passed This Way. is that at least four of the death dates
noted in this cemetery occurred in the months of June and July of 1853. This
large amount of deaths around 1853 is true
for the many of the cemeteries around Maury County such as the Tate,&nbsp; Zion,
Jackson College (Old Brick Church), Shane and other cemeteries in the county. It
is certain that an awful scourge (diphtheria, cholera, typhoid, Black Tongue or
others) swept through the
area at that time. In
those days of primitive living conditions and scant medical attention it was not
uncommon for epidemics to almost wipe out whole families or communities. This
one seems to have been unusually intense and widespread. Tradition says that it was a
Typhoid Fever epidemic. [F. L. H. 1987. Revised by W.A. to add other known
cemeteries where this is apparent.]

the book They </i><i>Passed This Way about
1967 Page B-71 by Evelyn Shackleford &amp; Marise Lightfoot, two ladies of the
1960 era who researched cemeteries and gave us great works, some of which was carried
over into this effort.</i></p>
