"<b>In Memory of BENNETT, son of Stephen &amp; Anna Blackman, born Nov 25,
1772 died Sept 15, 18__" (unreadable, possibly 1835). My first experience at seeing a gravestone
perched in a tree. Actually someone found it and stuck it up in between three
branches of the tree to keep the growth from covering it. This is a crooked
three forked Hackberry Tree located near the west side of the cemetery in
case the stone falls and gets lost below the tree and the tree continues to
thrive.<br/>

This footstone which probably belongs with this headstone of Bennett Blackman.
It has the initials B.B. about 20 yards southeast of this spot.
