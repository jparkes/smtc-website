CLINTON, Richard, 1755 - 18 Aug 1839. "Who was one of the Revolutionary
Patriots."<br/>
Richard Clinton was born in England in 1755. By the
time he entered service in the spring of 1779, he was living in the town of
Camden, South Carolina. While he was in service he marched 200 miles to Black
Swamp, then 250 miles to Charleston, South Carolina. He applied for a pension
December 10, 1834 in Davidson County Tennessee where he lived. Although he gave
details of his service for a longer period than nine months, he was allowed $30
per year for nine months service in Captain McCorkle's Company, under Colonel
Marshall's Regiment, South Carolina Line. He married in 1781 in South Carolina
Carolina Marcella de Urbeville (or Turbeville). Their children were: Rebecka,
who later married William Price Seah; and Anna Blackman born January 1, 1875,
married Bennet Blackman, and died May 31 1849. Richard Clinton spent his last
days with his daughter Anna Blackman in Maury County. When this old soldier died
at the age of 84, on August 18, 1839, he was buried in the Blackman family
graveyard (Blackman Cemetery) near Anna's home.<br/>
