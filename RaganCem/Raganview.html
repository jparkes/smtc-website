The Ragan Cemetery. I am told it was much larger that what is shown here at one
time. This Concrete Enclosure is only a part of the cemetery.</br>

The Roberson memorial
sits well out in front of the others but may also include other graves in
alignment with the Roberson graves. I can see the stump of a large Cedar tree in
the right of the photo. That tree may have been an active part of the cemetery
at one time. It is large enough to be hundreds of years old.</br>
