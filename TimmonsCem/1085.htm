Large Timmons Family Headstone with no
other markings. Perhaps it serves as family marker for Nancy Evans Timmons and
her husband Thomas Jefferson Timmons interred here without a detail foot marker.
There is an unmarked grave just south of the grave of Nancy Evans
Timmons. Mr. Fred Hawkins also noticed this in 1986.</br>
