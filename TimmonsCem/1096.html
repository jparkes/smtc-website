Tall stone lying
against the large rock tomb on our far left going back north on the 2nd row
(actually the third row counting Nancy Evans Timmons and the unmarked Timmons
graves behind the large headstone with surname marked only Timmons.<br/>

SELLERS, Mary Ann, 17 Nov 1804 - 12 Jun
1887. Aged 82 Years, 6 Mo's &amp; 25 Dys.<br/>
I believe the two parts of this stone which rest against the large rock tomb
behind are dislocated. It does not face east (or west) and the rock tomb behind it is said
to be for Revolutionary War Soldier John Johnson. I suspect the base of this
stone lies just to our left in the edge of the photo and the grave is then
further left of that. Why is that so important? It may hold clue to her closest
relatives.</b><i><b><br/>
