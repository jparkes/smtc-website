Large Timmons Family
Headstone with no other markings. Perhaps it serves as family marker for Nancy
Evans Timmons and another member of her immediate family interred here without a
detail footmarker. There is an unmarked grave just east and south of the grave
of Nancy Evans Timmons. Mr. Fred Hawkins also noticed this in 1986.</br>

Stone back against the fence row. There is another grave here beside Nancy's
without a marker.</br>
