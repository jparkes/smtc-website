A closer up image from the latter photo above get a clearer image of the
memorials. There are eight large concrete pillars outlining many of the Timmons
graves which have large granite grave covers. A log chain spans the perimeter of
these concrete piers. However, the chain has fallen in places.&nbsp;</br>

This red balloon arrow points at the place where the cemetery is located below
the trees on a private farm. We are standing at the side of Santa Fe Pike to
make this photo.</br>
