Front side of Judith Sellers memorial: &quot;Judith,[?] Wife of Isaac Sellers
Born 1772 &amp; Died Nov 10, 1847 Aged 75 Years. Based on what we see here the
slab rock memorial is not directly behind the memorials of Judith Sellers so
that is evidence that it is the unmarked tomb for John Johnson. See
below<br>

(Note: on back of stone, &quot;Repaired and reset 1979 by Homer &amp; Leslie
Sellers, g. g. grandsons of Judith &amp; Isaac Sellers.&quot; There appears to
be lettering between Judith and wife of and may contain an initial for Judith.
Black Lettering is peeling away and the inscribed lettering is weathering.<br>
The large rock tomb behind the memorial for Judith Sellers is said
to be for Revolutionary War Soldier John Johnson. There is another large flat
rock further northeast of this grave. but it is a fieldstone. That however may
be the informal marker for John Johnson. I say that because this flat rock (due
east) may cover Judith Sellers grave as her husband Isaac has a cover over his
grave and a footstone &amp; headstone also.</font></b><font color="#008000" size="2"><b><i><br>
