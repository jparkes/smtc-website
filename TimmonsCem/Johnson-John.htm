</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The John Johnson Tomb is beside Isaac
&amp; Judith Sellers. This is a large slab (grave cover) and it probably has not
been shaped by human carving, but instead is a natural stone. This is not the
only natural stone slab in this graveyard. One also exist shown in the center
near our left edge of this photo. It too could be an unmarked grave cover.

Here we see the large grave cover for Revolutionary Soldier John Johnson up
close while looking at the back side of the Judith Sellers Memorial and part of
the Isaac Sellers Memorial on the immediate right of the photo.

JOHNSON, John, probably born ca 1750-52, married 1771 Isabel Erwyn, died ca
1831-32, buried in a rock covered tomb with no inscription along side of Isaac
&amp; Judith Sellers. &quot;Served in Gen. Sumter's command thru the entire
Revolutionary War.&quot; (from the work of Mrs. Edythe R. Whitley.) A great
grandson, in Moore papers at the state archive library, says he was a:
&quot;Captain in the Revolutionary War under Marion - lived in Chatham Co.,
N.C., buried 5 miles north up Duck River from Roberts Bend.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i>[I have no reason to question this but the Hugh Cemetery across the Santa Fe
Pike about 800 yards due south is near the Duck River and also fits the
description of this 5 miles. However there are specifics mentioned here that if
correct cannot be ignored as pointing to this cemetery.&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>As a genealogist I have to wonder what the relationship John Johnson had to
Isaac &amp; Judith Sellers. The Sellers were a few years younger than Johnson
but not enough to be from a different generation. WA 10 Jun 2009.]</i>&nbsp;</font></b><font color="#008000" size="2"><b><i><br>

<i>The early morning sunlight cast a shadow of honor over this old soldier's
grave. We are free today because of his and other's sacrifices down&nbsp; thru
our 250+ years of history. In their honor let us resolve to continue in
diligence to standup for freedom and self rule as these people surely did. </i></font><font color="#008000"><br>
