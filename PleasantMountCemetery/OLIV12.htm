&nbsp;He was Tom Cooper's Great Grandfather. He is buried at
Pleasant Mount Cumberland Presbyterian Church next to his wife Valdaria Dillehay.
Hillary’s parents were Hezekiah Oliver &amp; Mahala Lewis. Hezekiah’s
father, Levin Oliver, was born around 1745 in Maryland and his father Leonard
Oliver was also from Maryland and born about 1725. One of Hillary’s sons was
Herbert L. Oliver who was my grandfather. Herbert had two daughters, Alice and
Mary. Alice Oliver married Thomas W. Cooper who are my parents.<br>

Here are some other bits of information I have on Hillary Oliver: 1st. Tenn Inf.
Col. M.R. Hill, Col. George Maney, Maj. Hume Field. Second Division. Maj. Gen.
Benjiman Cheatham. When the war between the states began, he was appointed
colonel of the 1st. Tennessee Infantry on May 8 1861. In July he was sent to
Staunton, Va. He served in Cheat Mt. campaign and joined Stonewall Jackson's
command at Winchester, Va. in Dec. 1861. In 1862 he was sent to Tennessee and
was placed in command of the 2nd. Brigade, Cheatham Division of Polks Corps. He
led the brigade in the battle of Shiloh with such single success that on April
16, 1862 he was commissioned brigadier general (note: this came from Mary Oliver
(Dixon) who copied it from a book at the Library of Congress. I have never found
the promotion to General in any documentation and have doubts if it is correct).
He took part in the battles of Perryville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, and
Missionary Ridge. Went to Tulane and became a doctor. The following was taken
from THE DAILY HERALD Saturday - January 27, 1900 Prominent Physician passes
