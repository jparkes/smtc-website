</b>
<br>
In early days, few food items were more important to the family than corn and, 
especially, the meal that could be
ground from it. It was hard, <br>
slow work to pound the corn into meal by the mortar 
and pestle method and the grist
mill was invented to shorten the process. The mill usually<br>
&nbsp;consisted of two 
heavy stones, with one or both, turning
in such a way that grain passing between them would be crushed in to a powder 
form. Power was 
furnished by animals or, more efficiently, water. A dam or pond was built to provide enough 
drop in water fall so that the weight 
of the water would turn a wheel<br>
which, in turn, would turn the giant grinding stones. Many of the earlier mills 
were built from&nbsp; parts forged in Germany and Europe. <br>
<br>
The first mill in Maury County was set up by David Love on Fountain Creek in 
1806 near this (Pleasant Mount) cemetery. About the same time Bunch's Mill<br>
was built on Rutherford Creek and in 1815 Moses Frierson set up his mill on Lick 
Creek. Jack Scribners Mill began
operation in the 1820&quot;s, Hardison's Mill<br>
&nbsp;and Hamner &amp; Zellner's Mill were 
founded in the 1840's and George Kinzer
started his mill in Sawdust in the 1850's. Stephen Dark built a mill that took 
his name, R. D. Ricketts built one
on Big Bigby Creek near Allensville, and Andrew Mitchell built a horse drawn 
mill near Santa Fe. Scott's Mill was
erected on Big Bigby Creek, Boston's on Carter's Creek and Kettle's on Duck 
River were all functioning by the 1880's.<br>
With the coming of electric power, modern rolling mills took over in the 1900's, 
however, and the old family grist
mills gradually ceased operation and not one of them is functioning today in 
Maury County. The one started on the site on Fountain Creek near here in the 
early 1800s by David Love ceased operation by 1940. Today a trip down to the 
banks of Fountain Creek finds only some relics of that time. </font></p>
