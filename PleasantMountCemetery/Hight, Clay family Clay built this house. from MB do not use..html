<div>This is the house that Clay Hight built on Hwy 50.  He is buried at 
Pleasant Mount Cemetery.  His wife was Susie, I have encluded a picture of 
the two of them.</div>

<div>When my sister and her husband bought the old farm house it was in pretty 
bad shape.  It was sitting on these hugh bolders   It has a 
double stair case inside and hardwood floors.  The walls were little tiny 
slats of wood that looked like hardwood.  I loved it when they first 
restored it. It has been restore two times by them.   They have 
redone the walls and added on another bathroom (claw foot tub)  It is 
lovely.  They had to put inslulation and sheet rock over the wooden walls 
they were freezing in the winter time, but have maintained best they could the 
orginial look inside of the house.  I will send you a picture of the house 
when they bought it.  you won't believe the difference.  It looks like 
the picture when it was built now on the outside.</div>

<div>(for your eyes only:  Going to Columbia, on Hwy 50 (old Lewisburg 
highway) it is the house that sits back off the road with the white fence around 
the property.  It has a big wrought iron gate at the entrance to the 
house.)</div></font><br/><br/><br/><div><hr style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px"/>New <b>MapQuest Local</b> shows what's happening at your destination.
