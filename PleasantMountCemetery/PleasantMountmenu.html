<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy">The
Pleasant Mount Cemetery was formed from the hardy pioneers who were the followers of the Cumberland
Presbyterian faith in the Glendale Community. However it is also in measure a community
cemetery. This historic church and Cemetery is located just off of Highway 50 on
the north side and just east of the Fountain Creek &amp; old Bridge. The church
is very active and maintains a prominence in the community.&nbsp;</br>
It belongs to a people who know the meaning of the traditional values of
orderliness &amp;
neatness. The cemetery is probably one of the best maintained in
the county with no visible signs of lawnmower scrapes and other evidence of
those rushing thru a task that should be plied with care and respect for
those gone before.&nbsp;</br>
