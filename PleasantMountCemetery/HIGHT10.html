This house was built by Clay Hight. It is located on Hwy 50 Columbia to
Lewisburg. Clay Hight is buried at Pleasant Mount Cemetery. His wife was
Susie. <br/>
My sister and her husband bought the old farm house at the time it was in bad
condition. It was sitting on large boulders. It has a double stair case inside
and hardwood floors. The walls were little tiny slats of wood that looked like
hardwood. I loved it when they first restored it. It has since been restore
two times by them.  They have redone the walls and added on another
bathroom (claw foot tub) It is lovely. They had to put insulation and sheet rock
over the wooden walls because they were freezing in the winter time, but have
maintained best they could the original look inside of the house. The current
owners are Mr &amp; Mrs. James Bradburn. <br/>
