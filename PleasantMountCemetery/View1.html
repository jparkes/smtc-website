Looking west from the east side same photo as #1 but pointed further south. You
are looking out across the memorials at Pleasant Mt Cemetery.  Use
your slide bars for a full view. Most of the stones face the east and I am sure
all the interments are facing east in keeping with the Christian belief that
Christ will come from the east someday.<br/>
