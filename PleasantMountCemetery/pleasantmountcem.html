<p align="center"><b>PLEASANT
MOUNT CEMETERY-MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE-GLENDALE/HURRICANE SWITCH</b></font><p align="center"><b>The
following list is about 40 internments submitted by Mark Murphy as being related
to him in some manner. Though it does not give the relationship it shows how interrelated all
of these people were.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b>From:
Mark Murphy of Texas To: Wayne Austin 18 Feb 2003.&nbsp;</br>
</font>It is just a very high probability that William B. Murphey (1801-1867) who
fought in the Civil War and his
wife Mary (Polly) Benton Murphey (1811-1860) are buried in the Pleasant Mount
Cemetery. They both died before the</font></font> cemetery became &quot;official&quot;. They
were all Cumberland Presbyterians around there, as was the Pleasant Mount Church
built in 1867 (I'm told). Their sons came to Texas (Navarro Co) to another C.P.
Church as well. My grandfather was b. 1873 in Culleoka and came to TX with his
family by wagon at the age of 2. I do have Nancy E. Benton Murphy, b. 1850 in
Culleoka listed. She was the
daughter of William Hill Benton &amp; Eleanor Stacy, and is not in my Gedcom.
She is the first
cousin to my Polly Benton. I wonder who she married?&nbsp; I don't know Mildred Murphy b. abt
1910 who is pictured in the Culleoka Hi Annual for 1928, but I don't
have collateral lines that far in the future beyond the children of William &amp;
Polly. My guess is I'm
related to most all the Culleoka Murphy's descended from that time. These Murphys
do not relate to the Miles P. or Nathaniel G. Murphy lines, or a George Murphy who
was there in the county in the early 1800s either. Wish I could nail it down better than what
I've done. I'm related to all
of the following in Pleasant Mount Cemetery. (from Fred's book, as provided by
excerpt to me),but this list is also on my website.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
