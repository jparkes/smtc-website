<p align="center">SHAW CEMETERY, CULLEOKA, MAURY COUNTY
TENNESSEE</p>
<p><b>From Culleoka go east on Mooresville Pike for one mile. The cemetery is on
hillside behind Andrews' (was so in 1987.&nbsp; I did not get their names in
2005) house on left. Climb the hill going up from the
house about 500 yards, but bear slightly right <a href="ShawCemeterymap.htm">as shown on these
maps</a></b><b>. Several cedar trees, and thickets are in the
area of the cemetery.</b></p>

<p><b>This graveyard was so degraded from over growth of
trees, groundhogs and trampling from livestock that it is almost beyond finding
where the graves are located. Many of the stones are broken and away from the
head of the grave. My suspicions are that most of this occurred naturally from
the tree growth.&nbsp; The cemetery has been
abandoned for many years. There are graves and several fieldstones outside fence.&nbsp;</b></br>

We shouldn't expect the local farmer to understand how to care for graveyards
such as this.&nbsp;He probably does not understand nor is concerned that the tree roots and growth are destroying
this cemetery. It is a major undertaking to stop that. Somehow we need to
make this a more public responsibility. Generally now that falls on the descendents
if they are interested and can be found. Most don't know they are descendents 
and many don't care anyway.
Interestingly the people buried
here are probably great-grandparents of many folks out there today. I knew one of
my great grandparents and was only a few years away from being alive at the same
time as the other three, so where are the descendents?</br>
