SHAW, large base with no inscription remaining. Over in the far (southwest)
corner is the stone. It is fallen and the top with the inscription is missing.
We may be lucky and find it is below the ground and not really missing.</br>
<i>I was unable to exclude the livestock from the photo. Being a
curious lot they probably thought I was there to feed them. They forage for
scarce grass in the winter time.</i></br>
