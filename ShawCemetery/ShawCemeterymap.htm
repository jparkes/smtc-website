</font><font color="#800000" size="2">From Culleoka go east on Mooresville Pike (Hwy 373) for one mile passing
Friendship Church on your left. The cemetery is on your left on the
hillside behind the Andrews house. This land owner was so in 1987 when Fred
Hawkins visited. I was unable to ask their names in 2005. After permission climb the hill
going up from the
house about 450 yards as shown on these maps. You will find yourself among
groves of cedar trees. Look for a thicket with three crooked Hackberry Trees
surrounded by a wrought iron fence in need of repair at the top edge of the line
of grove of Cedars. <br>
Actually The owners have a farm road going around the east side (your right) of
the house. Follow that and it will come to a gate that turns west. Go thru the
gate and (close it behind you) immediately turn back up the hill (going north) and
continue thru the Cedar Tree thickets until you reach the cemetery. When you
exit the Cedar groves the cemetery is along that area.<br>
