Culleoka, July 12 - Mr. W.F.A. Shaw, one of the oldest citizens of our 
community, died at his home on the Mooresville Pike, Friday night, July 8, 1898. 
He was a farmer, a member of the Friendship Baptist church, and highly respected 
by all who knew him. During the winter he was knocked down by a horse, and was 
so crippled that he was never able to exercise his limbs afterwards. He was 
buried at the family grave-yard and the funeral exercises were conducted by Rev. 
T.T. Thompson. </br>
