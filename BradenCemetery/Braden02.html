</b></p><center><b>BRADEN,
Alice A., 20 Nov 1843 - 9 Jan 1876 (32-01-18.) "Our Sister", (same
stone as James P.) This inscription is on the south side and James P. Braden's
inscription is on the north side of the memorial. "Our Sister and Our
Brother is inscribed on the sides of the stone leaving inscription on all four
sides. It is my opinion the scratch marks on the bottom of these stones are made
by the nearby Goats who come and go into this cemetery in spite of the fence.
The little rascals can easily jump any fence lower than 5 feet. <i>Photo &amp; information by
