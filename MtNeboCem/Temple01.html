Sawdust Valley. Death has again entered the home of our friend and neighbor W.L. 
Temple, and claimed his bosom companion, as another of its victims. Mrs. S.C. 
Temple was a daughter of John and Hannah C. McBride; was born December 5th 1848, 
professed religion and joined the M.E. South Church, at Mt. Nebo, in Sept. 1863; 
was married to W.L. Temple April 10, 1868. Six children blessed their union, 
four of whom having crossed the mistic river, no doubt were standing on the 
sunlit shore, waiting to welcome their mother, who went to join them, on 
February 21st 1891 at 1:30 P.M....Just before her spirit took its flight, she 
called her heart-broken husband and two weeping children to her side, took them 
by the hand, prayed God's blessings on them, and bade them good-bye; after which 
she called her friends one by one to her side and in like manner bade them 
farewell, sending a message of love to many who were not present. Then calmly 
fell asleep in Jesus. She leaves an only brother, B.F. McBride, and three half 
sisters, namely: Mrs. W.R. McKennon, Mrs. S.A. Stephens, and Mrs. H.J. Estes, to 
whom we tender our sympathies.... -- Columbia Herald Feb. 28, 1891.</font></br>

Mount Nebo....I deem it my duty to chronicle a few lines in memory of the death 
of one of our best Christian women, Mrs. Billie Temple, who was born Dec 5th, 
1849, and died Feb. 21, 1891. She was a consistent member of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, and died with the full assurance of meeting her peace in 
heaven, where there is no more death nor painful separation of kindred souls. 
Her blessed spirit is now at rest with her four children that proceeded her to 
the grave. She left a husband and two darling little children - a girl and a boy 
- besides a host of relatives and friends to mourn her death.... -- Columbia 
Herald, Feb. 28, 1891.</font><i></br>
