From &quot;Mom&quot; to &quot;Aunt Ruth&quot; to &quot;Granny,&quot; Ruth &quot;made herself useful and helpful&quot; to 
family and friends alike her entire life. She believed strongly in hard work and 
dedicated all her energy and time to caring for others. Ruth's life spanned nine 
decades, from riding her horse and buggy to Woodrow School to flying and driving 
coast to coast to see the country, visit relatives, and see the great National 
Parks.</br>
Ruth was outnumbered at home with a husband and four sons, but she managed the 
family, worked her vegetable garden, helped on the farm, and always kept a very 
positive and pleasant demeanor.</br>
A life-long member of the Mt. Nebo United Methodist Church, Ruth read the &quot;Upper 
Room&quot; Bible stories to her boys every night at bedtime and made sure they were 
in church every Sunday.</br>
The daughter and sister of school teachers, Ruth valued education very highly 
and graduated from Columbia Central High School as Salutatorian in 1935. She and 
her husband sent three sons through college and graduate school. Ruth worked 
first and foremost as a mother and a wife and being a homemaker, cooking, 
cleaning, and caring for her family and extended family, including feeding the 
farm hands.</br>
Before her marriage, Ruth worked at the Gordon's store in downtown Columbia. 
After her marriage, she worked as a substitute school teacher and finished her 
career by managing the ladies clothing department at Anderson Bros. and Foster, 
which later became Sullivan's Department Store, for 40 years. Everyone who ever 
met Ruth admired, respected, and loved her for the things she believed in, the 
things she stood for, and the example she set.</br>
She is gone, but will never be forgotten.</br>
