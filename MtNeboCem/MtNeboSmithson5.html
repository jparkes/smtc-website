SMITHSON, E.H., 6 Nov 1851 - 27 Oct 1899.<br/>
<br/>
Union, Oct. 31 - The death angel visited this neighborhood on the 27th, and 
claimed for its victim our friend and neighbor E.H. Smithson. He had been living 
in our midst nearly eight years, and had made many strong friends among us. He 
was born Nov 6, 1851 and processed faith in Christ when about 16 years of age; 
and in his last hours said all was well. He leaves his mother, two sisters (Mrs. 
Matt White and Mr. Jim Hayes), one brother (Mr. H. Smithson of Lawrence county) 
and three children, Mrs. W.F. Godwin, Andrew and Noble Smithson, to survive him, 
and a host of relatives and friends to mourn his death; but the best of all is 
that he was ready when the summons came. -- Columbia Herald, November 3, 1899.<i><br/>
