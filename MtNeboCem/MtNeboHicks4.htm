<u>James C. Hicks</br>
</u>James C. Hicks, one of the most generous, charitable and highly esteemed men 
of the community, died Thursday morning at his home on South High Street after 
an illness of several years. Mr. Hicks was 61 years of age and had been a member 
of the Christian church for a number of years. He moved to Columbia from Concord 
where he was engaged in the mercantile business and was likewise connected after 
coming to Columbia. He was a man of splendid character and was liked by every 
one who knew him. During his long illness, he never relinquished the 
consideration that he had for the hundreds of friends who administered to him 
nor the devotion that he had for his family. He is survived by his wife and two 
daughters, Misses Irene and Louise Hicks, also four brothers and four sisters. 
Funeral services were held Friday morning at Mt. Nebo church conducted by Elder 
F.C. Sowell, assisted by Rev. J.H. Barber. Maury Undertaking Co. in charge.
