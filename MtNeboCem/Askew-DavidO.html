<b>ASKEW, David O. (Owen), 18 Aug 1828 - 2 Sep 
1876. (&quot;Tenn. Cpl., Cop. F, 14 Regt. Tenn Inf. C.S.A.&quot; (s/o Bryant and Mary Ann 
Sowell Askew; note this man is also listed as being buried in Liberty Church 
Cemetery, in &quot;They Passed This Way&quot;, by Lightfoot and Shackleford.)</br>
update according to Laura Modine </br>
&nbsp;</b></p><CENTER><b>David died 
on Sept 2 1876 (instead of 1878 as reported on FAG) Also reported on the 
cemetery web site Findagrave his wife is reported as being Elizabeth White 
Boles. Their Marriage Certificate records her as Elizabeth V. Boles. I rely on a 
marriage licenses more since it is first person information being given about 
oneself before memory is usually affected. Census enumerators often have 
incorrect information, as well as family lore is often incorrect.</br>
I am not disputing what is already there just making my case for reliability of 
one record versus another.</br>

In the confusion 
of burials it is possible David is interred in the Liberty Church Cemetery and 
has a monument here. 



</b><strong>Often 
that is the way military markers are set especially in the confusion of the 
Confederacy.</strong><b> 
There are few marked stones in Liberty Church Cemetery and lost graves can be 
seen all around the graveyard premises. Sometimes when family are faced with 
setting a military marker they choose a common burial ground instead of the 
remote Liberty Church Cemetery. In this case of the Liberty Church Cemetery was 
at one time not so remote. Today there is a wooden military Marker set in the&nbsp; 
Liberty Church Cemetery by an interested party so that David has duplicate 
markers in both the Mt Nebo &amp; Liberty Church Cemeteries. [Wayne Austin, 31 Aug
