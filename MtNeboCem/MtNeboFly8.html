FLY, William J., 16 Jun 1852 - 16 Apr 1899. 
(Married; 1st Addie Kinzer; 2nd Sallie Paisley.)</br>
</br>
McCains. Our community was 
shocked last Sunday afternoon over the unexpected death of one of our best 
citizens, friend and neighbor - Mr. W.T. Fly. He was taken very sick with 
measles and only lived a week, departing this life Sunday eve April 16 at 6 
o'clock, in his 47 year. Just at the close of a beautiful day as the sun sank 
softly to rest, his spirit went back to the God who gave it. We feel that our 
community has suffered a great loss in his death, he being ruling elder in 
McCain's C.P. Church, a member of the Board of Trustees of McCain Academy. He 
was an upright Christian gentleman, having the esteem and friendship of all who 
knew him.</br>
</br>
In his early life he was married to Miss Addie Kinzer, of Water Valley; they 
lived happily together for a number of years, when God saw proper to take her, 
leaving Mr. Fly and one son (Marvin) surviving her. A few years later he was 
married a second time to Miss Sallie Paisley, of Campbellsville, Giles county, 
and lived happily with her until his death. During his first wife's life time he 
connected himself with the Methodist church at Bigbyville, joining the church at 
this place later, of which he has been a consistent member.</br>
</br>
A large concourse of relatives and friends followed him to Nebo, where his 
funeral rook place at 3 o'clock Monday afternoon, the services being conducted 
by his pastor Rev. M.E. Gabard.... -- Columbia Herald, Apr 21, 1899. </br>
