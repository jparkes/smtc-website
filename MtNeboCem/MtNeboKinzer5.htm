</br>
</font>KINZER, Malinda Locke, 1816 - 21 Feb. 1901. 
(w/o George Kinzer)</font></br>
</br>
</font>Married first to Hezekiah 
Powell Smithson. No reported marker.</br>
Mrs. Malinda Kinzer, wife of the late George Kinzer, died Thursday of last week 
at her home one mile from Nebo. Deceased was one of the oldest residents of that 
part of the county, having reached the advanced age of 84 years. The remains 
were laid to rest Friday afternoon at 1 o'clock. -- Columbia Herald, March 1, 
1901.</br>
On last Thursday death also entered the home of one of our oldest people, Aunt 
Malinda Kinzer, as she was familiarly called, and being nearly 85 years of age. 
For long years she lived in our midst, but nine years ago she moved to Union and 
resided there until a few weeks ago, when she moved back to the home. Aunt 
Malinda was a Christian, and in her last days, when inflictions fell so heavily 
upon her, she often prayed to die, to be freed from pain and sorrow, and to go 
home to heaven; she leaves three children, and several grandchildren to mourn 
her departure. She lived with her granddaughter, Mrs. Lillian Godwin, who will 
sadly miss her grandmother. -- Columbia Herald, March 1, 1901.</br>
