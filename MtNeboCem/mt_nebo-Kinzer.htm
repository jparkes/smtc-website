<p align="center"><b>Esq. W. G. M. Kinzer, aged 74 years, died at
his home near Sawdust Wednesday evening of last week very suddenly. He seemed in
his usual health except a severe cold until one hour before his death. On that
afternoon he fed the stock and returned to the house, then mended the fire and
complained of a severe headache. A member of the family bathed his head with
warm water and after he grew easy turned to put the bowl down and on returning
to him again found he was dead. Mr. Kinzer was an ex-Confederate soldier, was
largely connected and had many friends throughout the county who will regret to
learn of his death. The burial took place at Mt. Nebo Sunday afternoon, services
being conducted by Rev. M. T. Dickson, Pastor at Mt. Nebo, and Rev. W. T.
Haggard, pastor of the First Methodist Church of Columbia. He is survived by has
wife and six children, Mrs. Maude Lynn, Mrs. J. T. Wilkes, Mrs. G. N. McKennon,
Miss Frances Kinzer, who is in school at Pulaski; Henry Kinzer, of Oklahoma, and
Albert Kinzer of Hohenwald. He was a member of the Mt. Nebo Methodist Episcopal
church.<CENTER></b></font><a href="MtNeboCemList.htm"><b></br>
