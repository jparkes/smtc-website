<p><font size="2" color="#800080" face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel&nbsp; Hugh Brown was born in North
Carolina on 8 Feb&nbsp; 1762 and, as a young man, rode with Gen. Marion,
&quot;The Swamp Fox in his raids against British troops during the War of
American Independence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
His father, the Reverend Duncan Brown, brought their families to Maury County,
Tenn. where they became very prominent in the early development of the
area.&nbsp; Col. Brown was a leader in the cause of education and was on the
original Board with Col. James T. Sandford and others serving as Trustees of
Jackson College when it was near Spring Hill in 1829, two miles west of this
cemetery. It was initially founded as &quot;The Manual Labor
Academy.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All these folks were likely Presbyterian and probably were members of the old Bethesda
Presbyterian Church later known as the Brick Presbyterian Church adjacent to the
place Jackson College/Brick Church was located many years ago. As stated this
was only a couple of miles west of the Col. Hugh Brown Cemetery, but just across
Rutherford Creek. Wonder how many time this statement was uttered &quot;Today is
Sunday and we (the Brown family) will not attend church because the flood washed
out the bridge,&quot; Rutherford Creek is generally too deep to ford. Another
prominent family that attended this church was the James Black family. They
lived west of here in the eastern shadow of what is today the Saturn Auto Plant.<br>
<br>
Two of Colonel Brown's nephews, Neil S. and John Calvin Brown, made their home
with him while studying in the school. Both of them later became Governors of
the State of Tennessee. Neil b. 1810 &amp; John b. 1827 were born near the Elk
River in Giles County 30 miles south of this place.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Col. Hugh Brown was the father, of James Whitfield Brown who also lived
in this community. Col Brown died on 13 May 1851 and lies here in this cemetery
beside his wife Catherine.</font></p>
