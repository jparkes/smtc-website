We are looking southwest across the well maintained
Col. Hugh Brown Cemetery. Most of the little stones set to the east of the
larger ones are footstones. The graves are in the middle between the headstone
on the west side and the footstone on the east side. This was late in the
evening so the western shadow of the sun can be seen casting across the stones
eastward. <br/>
There are many unmarked stones here which are fieldstones marking graves mostly
on the eastern side of the cemetery. That may be the oldest section or it could
be slave graves.  Some of the fieldstones shown on our far left as flat top
stones may go back prior to 1815 when generally inscribed memorials became
widely used in this area.<br/>

</i></b>This photo taken standing on the wall from the south west corner shoots across the cemetery pointing eastward
and captures much of the memorials including the rock wall opening. I believe
about all the inscriptions face the east in this cemetery. That shadow in the
right lower part of the photo is from the John S. Brown memorial.<b><br/>

</b>Panning the camera to the northwest yields this photo of the balance of the
cemetery. There are no stones in the black shadow of the wall.<br/>
