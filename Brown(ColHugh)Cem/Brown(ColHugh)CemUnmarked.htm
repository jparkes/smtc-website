Notice on our left side of the photo a grave marked only with a fieldstone. This
is beside the Col. Hugh Brown memorial in the center of the photo. The memorial
for Catharine his wife is on our right out of the range of the photo. This may
be a clue that Col Brown outlived two wives. Something to investigate for the
curious.<br>
