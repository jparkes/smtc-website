BROWN, Col. Hugh, 8 Feb 1762 - 13 May 1851. Revolutionary
War Soldier, as a
young man, he rode with the famous General Francis Marion, &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot; in
his raids against British troops during the War of American Independence mostly 
in South &amp; North Carolina.
General Francis Marion was a leader in military tactics not seen before by the British,
which ultimately brought about their defeat. This is described as a forerunner 
of guerilla warfare tactics. The 
Patriots knew the terrain better than the British and General Marion got his 
reputation when he eluded the British by following the swampy lands.<b><i></br>
