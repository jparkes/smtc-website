<i>When I first found this old graveyard and memorial stone back in 1988 there
was a large but old &amp; dying rose bush vine standing over the stone on the
south side. It was so large and imposing it took significant cutting to
eliminate enough of it to get near this tomb for photos. I estimate it could
have been there over 100 years or longer as this graveyard was long abandoned
and no houses were near. It was the old fashioned hardy variety that the
pioneers grew and was quite large with a canopy of about 15 feet in diameter and
a height of about 9 feet. I remember my Mom imported one of these from her home
place in McCains, Maury County back about 1970 to her home and garden in the Old
Brick Presbyterian Church Community, Colbert County, Alabama and planted it.
Last time I checked that Rose bush was still there and growing. </i></font></b><b><i>Wayne
