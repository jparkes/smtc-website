</font><b><font size="2" color="#800080" >This is a shot
from the opposite end of the cemetery looking south. Notice the Hickman and
Weatherford family boxtomb or (large slabs on the ground) tops on our left and the large upright memorials of
the Kerbeys and their daughter and her husband the Chaffins on our right.
Further out and hard to make out with this photo are the memorials of the Scott
&amp; Gibson families. All the other stones are for children of the Chaffin, &amp; Scotts &amp; Kerbeys &amp;
Weatherfords, except Mastin Weatheford. <i>Photo by WA. Jan 15, 2008</i></font></b><font  color="#800000" size="4"><br>

view looking northwest at the box tomb on our lower left along with the many
upright common fieldstone memorials that mark graves. Generally these were from
burials during the years prior to 1820 when inscribed memorials were a bit
uncommon.<font >  We are looking from the foot to the head
of the graves. Most often these were for children but may
have been for some adults. Generally there was a headstone to the west of the
grave and a footstone to the east of the interred though some of the above graves do not
have a footstone. <i>Photo by WA dated Jan 15, 2008.</i></font>&nbsp;<br>
