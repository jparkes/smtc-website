OF CEMETERIES IN MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>

are looking at the western edge of the cemetery. The John &amp; Sue have used
all the loose fieldstones to create a rock wall much like they would in the
olden days. <i> Jan 15, 2008 photo by WA.</i></b><center><img border="0" height="497" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ChaffinCemetery/ChaffinCemRestored2008/IMG_4968.JPG" width="660"/><br/>

view looking mostly west over the cemetery shows the central right section of the
cemetery. All four of the box
tombs can be seen from this view including one on our far middle right.
When I first visited this cemetery in 1988 the old dead Beech tree in the upper
right of the photo was still alive and a very large tree. It soon started
dropping its limbs and upon one visit it had dropped about a 2 ton limb right
down on the William &amp; Lucy Chaffin memorial. Luckily that stone is very
durable and was not damaged.  <i>Jan 18, 2008 Photo by WA.</i></b><center><b><a href="chaffinview3.html"><br/>
