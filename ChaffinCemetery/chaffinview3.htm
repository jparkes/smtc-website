OF CEMETERIES IN MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

Cemetery-Wiley Hollow Road</b><center><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ChaffinCemetery/ChaffinCemRestored2008/IMG_4952.JPG" width="642" height="480" ></center>
<p><b>A
View looking at cemetery from the lower northwest corner near the William
Chaffin Memorial. Prior to the restoration the viewing distance was much more
restricted as shown in the labeled photo below before the restoration. Photo
dated 1/15/2008. The digging above is largely caused by the Brawders'(owner,
restorers) removing
roots in an attempt to get the land level and also setting up some of the
footstones.</b></p>
