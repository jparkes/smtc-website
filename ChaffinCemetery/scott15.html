<center></br><b>SCOTT,
&quot;IN memory of Thomas Scott who died Feb 4th 1838 Aged 45 Years.&quot;</br>
<i>Isn't it interesting that the light color spot on the left center of the
stone which is lichen still thrives after 6 years. There is a 5 years span
between the top photo 1/2008 and the bottom one 12/2002.</br>

<i>From Pat Cribbett to
