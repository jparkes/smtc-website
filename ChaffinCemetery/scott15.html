<center><br/><b>SCOTT,
"IN memory of Thomas Scott who died Feb 4th 1838 Aged 45 Years."<br/>
<i>Isn't it interesting that the light color spot on the left center of the
stone which is lichen still thrives after 6 years. There is a 5 years span
between the top photo 1/2008 and the bottom one 12/2002.<br/>

<i>From Pat Cribbett to
Wayne Austin 12 Jun 2008: Thomas' daughter, Martha married Allen G. Brown. They
had a daughter, Samantha. We've never been able to determine where Samantha
&amp; her family are buried nor Martha &amp; Allen Brown. Photo &amp; info by
Wayne Austin 4/7/04. Update by Pat Cribbett 12 Jun 2008</i></b><p></p>
