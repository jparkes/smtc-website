Cousin Ross and I (Wes) finally got out to Chaffin Cemetery today and put up the
Memorial Marker for our (2nd great) uncle William S. Scott. As suggested I put it
between Holley's and Mary's graves.&nbsp;My only regret was that it was slightly
damaged in transit by a tow motor.&nbsp;</br>
I am glad that I was able to install this memorial. As white as this stone is it
now makes the cemetery easier to see. The Brawders (surrounding land owners
&amp; gardeners) have said they are going to sow
grass seed soon in the cemetery.
