<p align="center"><u><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">William S. Scott -
family &amp; War Service history</span></u></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">William S. Scott was born in Giles
County in 1818 according to Giles County tax and census records. He was the
oldest child of Thomas and Eleanor Scott. He had 3 brothers and 2 sisters. His
other brothers served in the Confederate army also, with two of them surviving
the war. His brother, Bennett K. Scott moved away to Henry County, Tennessee and
joined the 5th Tn. Volunteers, 2nd Co. I there in 1861. He died in a skirmish
near Columbus, Kentucky December 20, 1861. Thomas and John Scott survived the
war. He had two sisters, Martha Brown and Nancy Elizabeth Scott Pullen, whose
descendents are with us today. My great great grandmother was his sister, Nancy
Elizabeth Scott Pullen.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">William S. Scott settled in this area
and married his first wife Mary Reeves on *2 Feb 1840. Mary died in childbirth with
William's eldest son Stephen Scott on January 6, 1841. Stephen, his stillborn son, I
think was named after his father, hence the &quot;S&quot; in William S. Scott. His wife and
their son are buried here in the Chaffin cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">After Mary's death in 1841, William
remarried again. This time to Holly Vincent. They would become the parents of
Evaline, Mary S., Jonas E. T., Angeline, Clara, and Lucy Ann. Mary S. and Lucy
Ann are buried here at Chaffin also along with their husbands.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">In 1861, William and a group of men
from Mt. Pleasant who would form Co. D, would join in the first organization at
Lynnville, Tennessee, the 3rd Tn Infantry on May 16, 1861. They would train at
Camp Cheatham. After first going to Bowling Green, Kentucky, they would enter
their first battle at Ft. Donelson. All of the 3rd Tn would be captured at Ft.
Donelson on February 16, 1862. All of the 3rd Tn and other captured units would
be taken to prison at Camp Douglas near Chicago, Illinois . They were confined
there for 7 months and 7 days. Most of the men of the 3rd Tn and even the mascot
of the 3rd Tn Co. H., a rooster named Jake Donelson, survived this prison camp
and would be paroled at Vicksburg, Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">The war was over for William S. Scott
however. He would be admitted to the prison hospital at Camp Douglas , July 16,
1862 and would die on July 22, 1862, the results of poor conditions and from diarrhea
caused by encephalitis. From family speculation, he was buried in a prisoners
grave on the grounds of Camp Douglas. I have heard of other soldiers who have
died there being dumped into nearby Lake Michigan, and some being used as
medical cadavers in local hospitals in the area. To sum up what kind of prison
camp Camp Douglas was all one would have to do is hear its nickname &quot;Eighty
acres of Hell&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">*The early deaths were buried in
shallow graves in the old city cemetery. The old cemetery was located where
Lincoln Park is now and near lake Michigan. When there was high tides, usually
contributed to storms, the tide would wash many bodies out into the Lake. They,
also, had a real problem with gravediggers stealing the corpse for the medical
school in Chicago. About midway thru the war they quit burying at the old
cemetery because of all the problems. Since William Scott was an early grave it
is unknown if his body was one of those that was recovered when they transferred
the bodies to Oak Ridge. His could have been one of the bodies washed out into
the lake or stolen by a grave digger. The answer to that will never be known.
There was very poor record keeping and no one really knows who all was buried
there nor how many were actually recovered. The feds hired a company to exhume
the bodies for reburial. Like all Chicago firms and government contracts they
falsified records to maximize their return. They were paid based on the body
count claimed to be exhumed &amp; buried. It was a big scam from beginning to
end. A whole chapter covered that deal.[Pat]</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">After the war, when Camp Douglas was
no longer needed; all the bodies buried there , some from surrounding areas, and
yet others whose bodies that had washed up from Lake Michigan were again buried.
This time in a mass grave which today is known as the Confederate Mound. There
are over 6,000 men buried there under 1 acre of land. [Wes]</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">Of these 6,000, 4,800 of the names
were listed on Camp Douglas's record books, and another 1200 are known only to
God. William&nbsp; Scott's name is in the Camp record books. His name is also
inscribed on the plaque on the statue where the Confederate Mound is located
there in Oakwoods cemetery.[Wes]</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: #CCCCCC">In January of this year I was able to
procure a military memorial stone for William Scott. After much discussions with
other cousins, we determined where in the cemetery William's memorial stone
would be set. It was decided to put the memorial between his wives graves. This
is what we feel he would have wanted and this is what my cousin Ross Pullen and
I did. My thanks goes out to two people who were not able to attend the
dedication ceremony 11 Oct 2009, Pat Cribbet and Wayne Austin, without their
research this dedication would have not have possible. [Wes].</br>
