Map</a>) on Mooresville Pike, 1/4 mile south of Old County Farm.
The cemetery is on the hillside, behind barn on Ernest Taylor place
(1987).&nbsp; (GPS pointers for this cemetery are located on the 2005 Delorme
electronic road map and are accurate).<br>
<br>
This is a typical abandoned rural cemetery in bad repair. There is a rock wall
around it but the vegetation is out of control and all of the stones are missing
or broken or fallen.<br>

There is a home out front near the Pike that may have been the former home of
the persons interred here but appears to be (from the architecture) later than
that. Probably a rebuild or remodel, but nevertheless a historical icon very
typical of the homes around Culleoka built prior to 1900. Mr. Bill McMillon who
lives there and showed me the cemetery says the house was built about 102 years ago (from 2005). The
Taylor's (Henry) lived there before him and passed or sold the property to him
about 28 years ago. Bill was a very helpful and cordial in helping me find and
photograph the cemetery.</font></p>

Wayne Austin visited there Nov 29, 2005 in the late evening. This late visit
yielded less than great photos. Digital cameras don't perform well in the
twilight.)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000">This is Mr. Fred Lee Hawkins
commentary on this cemetery in 1987:<br>
This cemetery was once enclosed in a beautiful hewn rock wall. The stones
were large and fitted together without mortar. It has now tumbled down
in various places. 2 or 3 graves sites are marked with fieldstones and
at least 2 box tombs were found whose inscribed tops were missing.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">This further 2009 commentary was
from a letter by a probable descendent of this cemetery Randy Farrar of Texas.
Possibly the best proof he has for his position is the inability to account for
the burial of his lost Myrick ancestors mentioned below:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;This is all leans toward
speculation on my part, but I believe two probable burials in the Myrick
Cemetery here would be my gggg-grandfather, <u>John Myrick (1777-1838), and my
ggg-grandmother, S. M. (1805-1838).</u> Both died about 1838. I think what
happened was after my ggg grandfather, John Myrick 1803-1856), received his 1280
acres in Texas in November of 1836, he made plans to move his family there to
Shelby County, Texas. His last child, John Myrick was born about 1838. I believe
that S. M. stood for Sarah M. Do not know her maiden name. I believe she died in
childbirth. I believe the five children of John and Sarah lived with Elizabeth
(Kirk) Myrick until her death in 1844. Louisa married William Morgan and John
(1838) shows up with them in 1850 Giles County, Texas. Dorothy married William
Reavis in 1849 and show up in 1850 census of Shelby County, Texas. Mary and
Martha show up with Aunt Mary (Myrick) Whitaker in 1850 Maury County, Tennessee.
So to make a long story short - I think that <u>John Myrick (1777-1838) and
Sarah M. (?) Myrick (1805-1838) are buried here in Myrick Cemetery</u>.&quot;<br>
