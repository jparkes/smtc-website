  cemeteries listed below are by no means 100% complete transcriptions unless I
  state otherwise. These are burials that I have uncovered in my research of
  many families in the Maury County area or have looked up for other people.
  Many of them I have not looked at personally but only have been looked up in
  the books <u>They Passed This Way</u> or <u>Maury County Cemeteries</u>. There
  are also many listings here from death records in the newspapers, in the
  Williams Funeral Home death records or from the book Maury County Genealogist.
  Others are burials that �older� family members have told me about, but are
  no longer marked.<o:p>

how he ties to the Zollicoffer's of Maury County but have not found a connection

The closest match is a Robt. Zollycoffer, age 3, mulatto, found in Lynchburg,
Moore County, Tennessee.)</p>

<p>Zion Presbyterian Church Cemetery</p>
<p>Youree, F., no dates, C.S.A.</p>
<p>Where Are They?</p>
<p>Kennedy, Andrew, born about 1806 - died about 1868</br>
Kennedy, Martha Susannah Reams, born about 1819 - died about 1860</br>
Kennedy, William L., 1842-22 July 1861</br>
Andrew was the son of John Kennedy and Nancy McDaniel who came to Maury County
in 1807</br>
sometime after Andrew's birth as he listed Kentucky as his birth place. Andrew
lived between the</br>
communities of Mount Joy and Sandy Hook in the southwest part of Maury County.
He married</br>
Martha Susannah Reams, daughter of Joshua Reams and Mary Winslow, on 11 Dec 1839
in Maury</br>
County. They had 8 children, one of which is the above mentioned William L.
Kennedy. William</br>
enlisted in the Civil War but was soon sent back home due to illness. Muster
rolls tell us that he died</br>
at home on 22 July 1861. Years of research have not turned up any marked graves
for them. They</br>
could possibly be buried at Sheepneck Cemetery where there are not many marked
graves, or in</br>
unmarked graves at Hunter Cemetery or Bailey Cemetery. The only other
possibility is that there</br>
could have been a family burial ground on his property. He owned a great deal of
property in the</br>
Mount Joy and Sandy Hook area. His other children are all buried in Arlington
Cemetery (2 of them</br>
in unmarked graves that have recently been discovered).</br>
Kennedy, Robert Gordon, about 1797 - about 1873</br>
Kennedy, Susannah English Majors, born about 1827 - died after 1873</br>
Robert Gordon Kennedy was the son of John Kennedy and his first wife Barbara
Gordon. He first</br>
married Caroline Moody, who is buried at Arlington Cemetery. After her death, he
married Susannah English Majors, daughter of Thomas English and Susannah Helton
and widow of James A. Majors. She was still living after Robert's estate papers
were filed in 1873. Robert could have been buried next to his wife Caroline at
Hunter but there is no marker for his grave. Susannah could be buried with her
parents in an unmarked grave in the English Family Cemetery. Robert and Susannah
are last seen on the 1870 census living in the Mount Joy area so cemeteries in
that area are also possibilities.</p>
