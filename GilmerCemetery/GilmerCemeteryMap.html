 Going South on Hwy #245 (Campbellsville Pike), turn left (East on to Moore
Lane). Travel East on Moore Lane for ca 1.0 mile. Just pass 4673 Moore Lane (on
right) is the old Gilmer property, including the homeplace, added to and
remodeled. West, northwest of the homeplace, up the hill about 250 to 300 yards
is the cemetery. There is a wagon road up the side of the hill but I do not know
who actual owns the road. <i>Instructions by Ronnie Erwin.</i></o:p></b><o:p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i></br>

The topographical map above shows the
cemetery location marked on the map with a red + from the web site Epodunk. It
is my (Wayne Austin) opinion that the Red + is marked in the wrong place on this
map by GSIS federal map makers. </b></o:p><b><o:p>

The Gilmer Memorials are shown here with  </b>
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Bobby
Cates poised for the photo. Bobby located the off the beaten path spot one day
while hunting and later mentioned that to the Uncle of Ronnie Erwin, J. B.
Erwin. Bobby later escorted Ronnie Erwin (our site contributor) to the cemetery.
</br>
Regarding the </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">current land owners
mentioned above Ronnie is of the unconfirmed opinion Joe and Susan (Gilbreath)
Erwin owned the property. </br>
While we are uncertain who contributed the knowledge and resources to preserve
this cemetery &amp; history by renewing these stones around the early 1990s we should
certainly thank them.</b></o:p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
