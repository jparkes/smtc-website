<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy">Going South on Hwy #245 (Campbellsville Pike),
turn left (East on to Moore Lane). Travel East on Moore Lane for ca 1.0 mile.
Just pass 4673 Moore Lane (on right) is the old Gilmer property, including the
home-place, added to and remodeled. West, northwest of the home-place, up the hill
about 250 to 300 yards is the cemetery. There is a wagon road up the side of the
hill but I do not know who actual owns the road. </br>
If you are traveling from from Pulaski Pike (Bee Line Road) Hwy #31 and turn on
to Moore Lane, going west, you will come to Hopewell Road on your right. From
Hopewell Road you go ca 1 mile. The Gilmer Place will be on your left. </br>
For your information, as you travel south on Campbellsville Pike the road just
south of Moore Lane is Tol Dugger Road. You can also get there by turning on Tol Dugger
Rd west and after going 1.6 miles you will come to Stockard Road. From
the Tol Dugger/Stockard intersection, you go north 1.1. miles until you reach
Moore Lane. From there you will turn left (west) toward the Gilmer place. <i>Instructions
