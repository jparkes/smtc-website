</font></b>From Highway 31
South at McCains turn west (right) onto Bigbyville Road for 1/4 mile and then
turn left onto (Perry) Cemetery Road. Continue south until the road bends west
and goes by the old Perry Home on the right. Shortly after that turn north
around a tree line for about 100 yards and the cemetery will be in a thicket
about 200 yards northwest of the home.&nbsp;

Looking from inside the cemetery stones are all around in this setting. Some
scattered as far as 50 yards. Many old field stones probably for slaves and early
settlers before memorial stones were widely available.</font><b><a href="../Murphy(Miles)Cemetery/MurphyCemMaps.html">
