fieldstone clearly marking a grave. The headstone is at the top center of the
photo and the footstone is near the bottom center. These are common rocks stood
on end and buried in a way they would stand. This is between the area of Milton
&amp; Lydia Scott and the main area of the Perry cemetery south of this spot.
There may still be someone on this earth that knows who is interred here. <br/>
