Milton, died 11 Apr 1893. Age 78 years. <br/>
and<br/>
SCOTT, Lydia, died 17 Jul 1902. Age 85 years. Evidence here points to the fact
that Lydia &amp; Milton are H&amp;W due to the birth dates and style of stone.
(These graves are separated from the rest of graves and on other north side of
grove.) I dug up Lydia's stone. It was completely under the ground and just the
corner of the base was protruding. No previous researchers have found Lydia's
stone before. At least it is not in anyone's publication. <i>Folks if one can
easily stumble upon and find stones like this I become aware that there must be
many more which are fallen and need careful research to find but would provide a
wealth of lost genealogy.<br/>
