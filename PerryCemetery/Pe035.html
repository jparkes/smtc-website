</font></b><center><b>PERRY,
unknown, Opps! I missed this one. We are looking at the back or front side of a
base and I would think that the top points up toward the top of the picture and
is about 2-4 inches under the leaves and debris. Had I realized this at the time
of this photographed I would have uncovered the stone and photographed it.
However, it is possible this is only the base and the top has fallen out and is
seperated from the base but I think it 90% probably this is the whole stone
because of the the way a stone (on its side) falls when the top and base stay
together in one peice.</br>
