After an illness extending over a period of more than two years, Flavius J. 
Ewing died at his home on the Pulaski Pike near South Side Park Thursday evening 
at 7 o'clock and while his death had been expected almost at any time during the 
past ten days, it was a distinct shock to his friends, and the friends of the 
family. During the period of his illness he had borne his suffering without 
complaint. <br>
Mr. Ewing was in his eight-second year and had been a resident of Columbia for 
more than thirty years, and long been identified with its business interests, 
and at one time figured very prominently in the financial affairs of the city 
and county, and was highly regarded for his integrity and business connections. 
Always standing for what he regarded as the best interests of the larger number, 
he was also active in educational and church work of the community. He had been 
a member of the board of officials of the First Presbyterian Church for more 
than twenty-five yers, and was its eldest member, both in point of services and 
in age. Mr Ewing was born in Marshall County and came to this county early in 
life. He was married to Miss Mary Akin, daughter of Pleasant J. Akin, a well 
known citizen of the county, and is survived by four children; Mrs. C.T. Looney, 
Mrs James T. Moore, R.C. Ewing of the firm of Dobbins &amp; Ewing, and Miss Elsie 
Ewing. Also one brother, Dr. J.C. Ewing of Lewisburg. - Columbia Herald (Buried
