THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN<br>
</p>
<p>Columbia, Tenn., March 1--(Spl) Members of the local Kiwanis Club yesterday
heard an address on the life of James Knox Polk, Maury county native who rose to
the presidency, delivered by County Judge W.C. Whitthorne, who has long been a
close student of Polk's life.<br>
The speaker briefly traced the career of the President whose ancestral home here
has just been restored as a national shrine, from the time of his birth in North
Carolina through his boyhood here, and on into the office of chief executive of
the nation.<br>
