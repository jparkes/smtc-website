Nashville Union and American on 23 June 1871, relating the accident read as
follows:<br>
The remains of Mr. R. Voss, who was killed by an accident on the<br>
Northwest Railroad was forwarded to Columbia, Tennessee, yesterday at<br>
3 O'clock, to the residence of his brother, J. T. Voss, for<br>
interment. His untimely death is a severe calamity to his family and<br>
relatives, especially to his mother, who had dreamed that he was dead but a few
nights before the accident by which he lost his life. He was going home to
assure her that he was alive and well. The remains were in charge of R. H.
Groomes &amp; Co., Nashville, C. R. Groomes accompanying the corpse. R. M.
Reynolds, Assistant Superintendent of the Nashville and Decatur Railroad kindly
furnished passes.<br>
