</font>MAGUIRE, T.F., 17 Dec 1849 - 17 Sep 1864, Age 15 years, &amp; 
9 months. &quot;IHS&quot; Block &quot;O&quot;</font></b><h1 align="center"><i>
<u>Query or added info from 
the Dedman family</u></font></br>
</font></i>My gr-grandfather 
Mora Brooks Fariss bought one and a half lots at Rosehill back in the 1930s or 
so. Buried on the half lot already was T. F. Maguire who was about 15 when he 
died. Do you have any idea who T. F. Maguire was? I have checked into Patrick 
Maguire without success. I'm curious as to who we will be buried alongside one 
of these days. (see attached photo).</br>
Maguire is buried in O section, Lot 72 (1/2 South). No one is buried in the 
other 1/2 section, and I have written Oaks and Nichols to see who owns it. My 
mother and father are buried in the same 1/2 section as Maguire. </br>
