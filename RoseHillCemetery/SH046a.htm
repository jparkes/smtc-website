HILL CEMETERY, COLUMBIA TENNESSEE</br>
Robert &quot;Bob&quot; W. Hardy, 54, husband of Columbia native Betty Jo Sharp,
died Thursday in Birmingham, Ala. Graveside services are Saturday in Rose Hill
Cemetery for the Albertville, Ala., resident and TVA employee.&nbsp;</br>
The Birmingham, Ala., native was the son of Mrs. Mary S. Thompson Hardy of Boaz,
Ala., and the late William W. Hardy. He was a Methodist, a Korean War veteran, a
member of the Albertville Lions Club and Golf and County Club. Survivors in
addition to his wife include two daughters, Mrs. Amy Elizabeth Hundley of
Lithonia, Ga., and Mrs. Mary Langley of Memphis; a brother, William H. Hardy of
Tuscumbia, Ala; and three grandchildren. Pallbearers are Jimmy Matthews, Bill
Stanfil, J.C. Parks, Tilman Knox, Edwin D. Jones, Ray E. Hodges and Dale
Bridges. His wife was a writer for the Daily Herald. She just moved back to
Alabama and there was an article in the Herald about that. She is a journalist
and was one in Alabama for years from what I understand. She wrote editorials.
