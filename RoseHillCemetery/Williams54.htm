Mary Bob, you created Memorial #14116390 for Edward Williams who is buried in 
Rose Hill. You mention he had 19 children by several marriages. In your joint 
project with Wayne on the Williamsport Methodist Cemetery, two of Edward's wives 
are listed there:</br>
</br>
(1) Eleanor Elizabeth (Dedman) Williams who died at age 21 after delivering two 
children: William Howard Williams (6 Mar 1846) and Elizabeth Williams (10 Jan 
1848). The son was named for Eleanor's father, William Howard Dedman (burial 
unknown) who married Elizabeth Haile (burial unknown) in Mecklenburg County, VA, 
and moved the family to the Leatherwood Creek area northwest of Williamsport.
</br>
</br>
(2) Dorothy (Darby) Williams (26 Jan 1820-20 Sep 1843) who died at age 23. I 
found one son, Thomas Hamilton Williams.</br>
</br>
(3) I found a third wife, Delilah &quot;Lila&quot; A. McConnico who married Edward 
Williams on 9 Oct 1851. They had one daughter, Lilly B. Williams (b. 1859). I 
have not found &quot;Lila&quot; yet. </br>
</br>
</br>
</font>On a note of trivia, Edward and 
Eleanor's son, William Howard Williams married Mary Elizabeth Sarven, and they 
had seven children. Their third was Howard Sarven Williams (16 Jul 1878 - 5 Sep 
1960) became a well known evangelist.</br>
</br>
Wayne, your photos of the stones of Eleanor Williams and Dorothy Williams are 
quite good. Unfortunately the spires on both have toppled. </br>
