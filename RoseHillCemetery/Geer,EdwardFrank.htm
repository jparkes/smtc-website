Edward Franklin &quot;Pop&quot; Geers, was a native of Lebanon, Tennessee, born
in 1851. At an early age he showed exceptional talent for training and riding of race horses. By the time he was<br>
20 years old he had already acquired and trained several horses for harness racing. Over the next 50 yrs.<br>
Pop Geers became one of the best known and most successful trainer and drivers in the history of that sport.
Earlier in life he had moved to Spring Hill, Maury County, and made his home
there. On Sep. 3, 1924, at age 70, he was racing in Wheeling, W. Va. when his horse stumbled and
`Pop&quot; fell from the sulky. He was subsequently trampled by his horse and died in just a few hours of the injuries.
His remains were returned to Columbia and laid to rest in the Rose Hill Cemetery.
The residents of county erected a monument in his memory in the park shown above on W. 7th
St.

  50,000 PAY TRIBUTE TO GEER'S MEMORY<br>
  Activities at West Virginia Fair Are Suspended Out Of Respect to Dead Driver<br>
  Wheeling, W.Va., Sept. 4 -- At the scene of his last race a crowd of 50,000 
  today eloquent tribute to the memory of Edward F. (&quot;Pop&quot;) Geers, noted harness 
  driver and &quot;Grand Old Man of the Trotting Turf &quot; who went to his death 
  yesterday at the West Virginia State Fair.<br>
  Just at the hour of 2 o'clock, when Geers had been scheduled to drive Peter 
  Manning in an attempt to lower the half-mile track record, the horse was led 
  onto the track in front of the grand stand. He was draped in black, in memory 
  of the man who had driven him to victory many times.<br>
  A hush fell over the great throng as the horse was led slowly down the track 
  while a funeral dirge was being played in the grand stand. As the draped horse 
  stood before the thousands of spectators, Howard M. Gore, Assistant Secretary 
  of Agriculture, mounted the judges' stand, paid a glowing tribute to the late 
  reinsman, eulogizing his character, his common honesty and integrity, which, 
  he said, had gained for Geers, lasting fame in the sport of Kings. All other 
  activities of the fair were suspended during the memorial services. Geers 
  body, accompanied by relatives and friends, was taken to his home at Memphis, 
  Tenn., today. Scores of persons stood in silent tribute as the train carrying 
  the body of the famous driver passed out of sight.</font></b></div>

  GEERS, EDWARD FRANKLIN (Jan. 25,1851 - Sept.3 1924), turfman, was born in 
  Wilson County,Tenn., son of William T. and Emily (Woolard) Geers. As a mere 
  boy on his father's farm he became a local celebrity as a trainer and driver 
  of horses. He conducted a public training stable at Nashville in 1875, and one 
  at Columbia from 1876 10 1889. In 1880 he married Mrs. Pearl (Smith) Neeley. 
  His first trip North was in 1877 when he gave Alice West a record of 2:26, the 
  first trotter he drove in under 2:30. In 1879, with Mattie Hunter, he twice 
  lowered the record for pacing mares, the second time, to 2:16 1/2. At both 
  Nashville and Columbia he was patronized by Campbell Brown, and from 1889 to 
  1892 he was employed by Brown at Ewell Farm. Thus Geers became interested in 
  the Hal family of pacers which Brown was breeding. Going North in 1889, he 
  took Brown Hal on the Grand Circuit and made him the champion pacing stallion 
  with a record of 2:12 1/2. With Hal Pointer, the gelded half-brother of Brown 
  Hal, he won numerous contests during each of several Grand Circuit seasons and 
  in 1892 made him the world's pacing champion with a record of 2:05 1/4 ; later 
  lowered to 2:04 1/2.<br>
  In 1892 Geers was employed to train and drive for C.J. Hamlin of Village Farm, 
  near Buffalo, N.Y., at a salary of $10,000 a year, the largest ever received 
  up to that time by one of his profession. Leaving Hamlin ten years later, he 
  settled at Billings Park, Memphis, which was his headquarters for the rest of 
  his life, his chief patron there being F.G. Jones. <br>
  For twenty years Geers was the leading race driver of the world, winning 
  hundreds of races and more than a million dollars in purses and stakes. In 
  1894 he made Robert J. the world's champion as a pacer, by driving him to a 
  record 2:01 1/2; he brought out and first raced Star Pointer, 1:59 1/4, the 
  first light - harness two minute horse; he won the world's trotting 
  championship in 1900 with The Abbott, 2:03 1/4. He drove to their records<br>
  sixty-six trotters in the 2:10 list, the fastest being the Harvester, 2:01, 
  the champion trotting stallion of his day (1910) and he also gave their best 
  records to sixteen pacers in the 2:05 list. At Toledo, Ohio, in 1918 he won 
  the first race in history in which all the heats were paced below 2:00, Miss 
  Harris M. taking the first heat in 1:58 1/4 and Single G., Geers up, the next 
  two in 1:59 1/2, 1:59 3/4.<br>
  As a race driver, campaign manager, and turf tactician he was equally notable. 
  Personally he was modest, generous and honest. Because of his taciturnity he 
  was long known as &quot;The Silent Man from Tennessee.&quot; He was instantly killed 
  while driving in a race at Wheeling, W. Va., and in 1926 his admirers 
  throughout America erected a monument in his honor in Geers Memorial Park, 
  Columbia, Tennessee. <br>
