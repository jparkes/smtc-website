Gilmer, 1 Mar 1864 - 3 Dec 1945, Block "G", (On our left) <br/>

There could be other graves associated with the Dorset - Meriwether Monument as I did not
make a complete memorial inventory.<br/>
Notice the Rail Road Track in the background. That was the southeast trunk of
the Louisville &amp; Nashville Rail Road from Columbia toward Hurricane
Switch, Lewisburg and further. Believe it also branched south to Culleoka and
further to
Decatur Alabama.<br/>
