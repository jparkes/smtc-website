Dear Ms. Bradford,</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>I was disappointed when I looked at
the Rose Hill Cemetery entries. I did not see a listing for David WITHERSPOON (4
April 1789-1 June 1876) or his wife Penelope (Gee) WITHERSPOON (27 June 1792-27
Nov. 1863. As I recollect, the graves were toward the top of an incline. Of
course, this was quite a long time ago. I have pictures of both stones. His has
a curved top; hers is rectangular and straight across the top.<br/>
</b></i><b><i>The
top of the incline (Slope) is probably Section "M"  [WA 10/26/2009]</i></b></p>
