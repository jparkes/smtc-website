Honorable Joseph H. Fussell</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">HONORABLE JOE H. FUSSELL, a prominent attorney and 
ex-official of Columbia, Tenn., is a native of Maury county, and is a man too 
well-known in the state to need any formal introduction. He is a man who has 
made a record for himself along all lines of effort engaging his attention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He is the son of Henry B. and Eliza C. Fussell, the former 
a native of North Carolina and the latter of Maury county. The father was an 
architect and contractor, and Captain Fussell learned carpentering under his 
father's instructions, becoming a finished workman before his twentieth year. He 
was superintended the construction of some of the finest residences in the 
county, which stand today as monuments of his handiwork. The father died in his 
seventy-second year, and the mother died at the age of eighty-three. The 
Fussells are from England, and the maternal ancestors were of&nbsp; Scotch-lrish 
descent. The maternal grandfather, Joseph Kincaid, came from Kentucky among the 
first settlers of Maury county. In Kentucky he married Eliza McClees at the 
home of Mr. Clay, an uncle of Henry Clay, the latter being present at the 
wedding. While a young man Captain Fussell allied himself with the cause of the 
Confederacy, enlisting in the Confederate service in May, 1861, as a member of 
the First Tennessean regiment of cavalry. In this capacity he rendered valiant 
service as a soldier and officer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first blood shed in battle during the Civil war is 
known to have been in the command in which Captain Fussell served, in a skirmish 
on Mud river, in Kentucky, where one of his regiment was killed. The company 'of 
which he was captain was also the last to suffer in the final skirmish of the 
war, and even after the final surrender of the Confederate armies. Captain 
Fussell had many narrow escapes and thrilling experiences, both in the line and 
on staff duty. After the surrender he opened a law office in Columbia, Tenn., 
having been admitted to the bar in August, 1860. He soon- attained more than 
mediocre achievements, which led to his early elevation to office. He served 
sixteen years as attorney-general of his district, and in the discharge of his 
duties came to be recognized as one of the leading criminal lawyers of 
Tennessee. In his professional capacity he has been associated with some of the 
most important civil and criminal actions in the various courts of the state. 
He was one of the first to advocate the legal regulation of the liquor traffic 
and the adoption of stringent temperance laws; took the stump as a temperance 
advocate and canvassed the state for the cause; incurred in this the strongest 
opposition from the liquor dealers and&nbsp; their friends, often resulting in 
serious difficulties, and a number of times he faced revolvers and knives in the 
efforts made to drive him from the canvass. In 1882 he was nominated by the 
&quot;State Credit&quot; wing of the Democratic party of Tennessee for the office of 
governor. The nominating convention was composed&nbsp; of such men as James C. 
Bailey, M. C., GOV. James D. Porter, Gen. W. H. Jackson, Judge Harvey Lee 
Jackson, Hon. Ed. I. James, Judge Mac Dickison, Gen. Luke Wright, and a host of 
other prominent men of the state. The feature of the campaign was opposition to 
repudiation of the state debt and the acceptance of the proposition for 
settlement as made by the bondholders, which would have honorably relieved the 
state of more than $11,000,000 of debt. The opposing wing of the party favored 
repudiation of the debt; or at least a payment of 50 cents on the dollar. This 
policy prevailed, and the state debt was settled on that basis. Captain Fussell 
was elected president of the amendment work in Tennessee, which- had in view the 
prohibition of the manufacture and sale of liquors in the state. This work he 
followed through the legislature, having headquarters at Nashville until the 
amendment was defeated. This required a year of his time, and during that period 
lie conducted a temperance paper at Nashville, largely at his own expense. For 
this arduous service and the exercise of his time and talents he asked and 
received nothing. In 1901 he was an Independent Democrat candidate for Congress 
in the seventh district ; made a canvass of twenty-one days, carried his 
opponent's native county, the strongest Democratic county in the state, by a 
large majority, and came very near being elected, the final count giving the 
election to the regular candidate by a very small margin. Maury county gave him 
a good majority, the first time since the war a regular nominee of the Democracy 
failed to carry the county. He also carried the largest Republican county in the 
district Captain Fussell is at present a member of the state temperance 
committee, and is highly gratified to see the progress made along temperance 
lines. He took an active part in the defeat of the &quot;dispensary&quot; law, and in the 
resultant public good. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mrs. Margaret B. Fussell, wife of Captain Fussell, was a 
daughter of Capt. William Roberts and a granddaughter of Brig. Gen Isaac 
Roberts, who served under Gen. Andrew Jackson. She is a grandniece of Gen. James 
Robertson, the founder of Nashville.&nbsp; Captain and Mrs. Fussell have no children. 
After Captain Fussell's father died, he took his mother into his own home and 
cared for her until her death. Capt. S. W. Steele married one of his sisters, 
and after the war died in Nashville. Another brother-in-law was Rev. Baxter 
Calhoun Chapman, a noted Cumberland Presbyterian minister, who died. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Captain Fussell has been a Mason from early manhood, and is 
now a member of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee, and was master of Euphemia lodge, 
Columbia, Tennessee for five years. He is also a Royal Arch Mason and a Knight 
Templar, and was for five years eminent commander.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1880 he was elected grand commander of the Knights 
Templars of Tennessee; has frequently been state representative in the triennial 
conclaves, and is an active Masonic lecturer in the state. He is also a member 
of the Knights of Pythias, was the organizer and first chancellor commander of 
the lodge in Columbia, and held that position for six years. In early life he 
was a Whig but when the state seceded he took sides with the Confederacy and at 
the close of the war became identified with the Democratic patty, whose fortunes 
he has generally followed, though he has canvassed the state for the Prohibition 
candidates for the presidency. He is a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian 
church and has been a ruling elder since 1856. He was the organizer of the 
Tabernacle church of that denomination in Columbia; has represented his 
presbytery in the general assembly of the United States some ten or twelve 
times; has several times been moderator of his presbytery and of the state 
synod; and has been Sunday school superintendent for thirty-five years. He is 
now the president of the Cumberland Presbyterian council, of anti-unionists, 
composed of loyal Cumberland Presbyterians who oppose the proposed union of the 
Cumberland Presbyterian church with the Presbyterian church in the United States 
of America, or what is known as the Northern Presbyterian church, Those whom he 
represents propose to remain in the Cumberland Presbyterian church and adhere to 
the original doctrines of that church. In this work he is now actively engaged.</p>
