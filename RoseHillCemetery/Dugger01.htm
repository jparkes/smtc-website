</br>
My (Jack Dugger) Mother Ethel Dixon Smith Dugger told me that she rode horseback
from Broadview to McCains to go to what would now be high school. You read of
that school in some of the historical material about McCains Cumberland
Presbyterian Church. She then attended Tennessee Female Institute in Franklin,
TN, where she excelled in English, Mathematics and Piano. She obtained a
teaching certificate after attending school there and she then became a teacher.
Her first teaching job was in Adams, TN, between Springfield, TN, and Guthrie,
KY. She next taught in a one room school on Factory Creek, near Campbellsville,
TN, where she taught all 12 grades and had two boys who studied college algebra
because they planned to attend college after graduating from that school. I
really don't know when she taught in Broadview, but know she did.</br>
