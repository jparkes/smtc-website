CLUXTON, Mose W. (Wallace), 1849 - 1913. Moses Wallace Cluxton was born 25 Jul 
1848 in Fayette Co IL, son of Moses Cluxton and his 3rd wife Mary Lewellen 
Thompson Cluxton. Moses' father died in 1855 and his mother in 1859. He signed 
up twice for Civil War service, once for 3 months and the other for a year. The 
war ended before his last enlistment ended. He spent some of his service in TN 
and AL. He married Mary Adamson in 1872 in Champaign Co IL and they had a 
daughter Cora who died, as did the mother, in Randolph Co IN. In 1878 he married 
Eleanor (Ellen) Jane Cox in Randolph Co IN. They had 7 children: Joseph William 
b 1879 d 1889, Franklin Ambrose b 1881 d 1956, Jesse Chester b 1883 d 1884, 
Harley Ernest b 1885 d 1971, Clyde Lorin b 1888 d 1974, Linnie b 1890 d 1890, 
and Urana Alice Katherine b 1892 d 1927. Ellen died in 1900 in Iroquois Co IL. 
Moses married his 3rd wife Ociana Williams in 1903 in Marion Co IN. Other than 
the years he lived in Iroquois Co, he never seemed to stay anywhere very long. 
He was in Maury Co when he had surgery (a grandson said for cancer) and died. 
His son, Harley, arranged for his burial at Rose Hill. </br>
