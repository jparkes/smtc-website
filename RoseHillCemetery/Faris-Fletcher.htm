PROMINENT IN COUNTY AFFAIRS, DEAD<br>
<br>
End Comes To One Of The Well Known Republican Leaders<br>
<br>
LONG HELD PUBLIC OFFICES<br>
<br>
Twice Elected Trustee of Maury County, Twice Appointed Postmaster<br>
of Columbia and Twice Named as Member of County Court.<br>
<br>
Hugh Fletcher Fariss, one of the best known citizens of Maury County, prominent
in the public life for more than thirty years, died at his home on South Main
Street at 5:30 o'clock Monday afternoon. Mr. Fariss has been in quite poor
health for several months. Recently he began to fail rapidly and for the past
four or five days no hope whatever had been entertained for his recovery.<br>
His life held by the narrowest thread for the past two days and death was
momentarily expected.<br>
Mr. Fariss was a member of one of the oldest families in Maury County and was
born in Hampshire in November, 1839, and was therefore in the seventy-fifth year
of his age. When the war between the states commenced Mr. Fariss' sympathies, as
well as that of the other members of the family, were Decidedly with the union
and after the war was over he joined the republican party, continuing his
allegiance to that organization until the hour of his death.<br>
Few men have ever lived in the county who had a stronger hold upon the
affections of people than Mr. Fariss. Regardless of political affiliations he
was always popular. In 1882 he was elected trustee of the county in one of the
most notable races in the county's annals. In April, 1884, he was appointed
postmaster at Columbia by President Chester A. Arthur and served in that office
for four years.<br>
He resigned as trustee, but in 1888 was again elected to that office, serving
for two years. He had the distinction of being the last republican ever elected
to a county office in Maury County.<br>
In July, 1897, Mr. Fariss was again appointed Postmaster by President McKinley
and he served for five years. In 1906 Mr. Fariss was elected as justice of the
peace for the city of Columbia and two years ago was re-elected by an
overwhelming vote. As a member of the county court he was appreciated for his
conservatism, for his<br>
devotion to public interests and for his intimate knowledge of the public
affairs of the county. Mr. Fariss was public spirited although generally known
for his conservatism in public expenditures.<br>
Mr. Fariss was a loyal member of the republican party and for many years was a
member of the county committee, was often a delegate to the state conventions,
has served on the state committee and for several terms was the chairman of the
county republican committee.<br>
He had no patience with the so-called progressive movement but voted for Taft.<br>
Mr. Fariss was just as popular, in spite of his well known republican views and
loyalty, among the democrats as he was among the members of his own party. The
democrats repeatedly elected him to office, showing by their works their faith
in the man. He was a man of honor and integrity. During his administration as
trustee he paind county warrants at par. His official life was always clean and
efficient.<br>
Mr. Fariss was a loyal member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He was
married early in life to a member of the well known and influential Brooks
family of Hampshire and his wife and eight children of their union survive him.
Four of their children are sons, Mora B. Fariss, who is now deputy clerk and
master; Hugh Fariss and Monte Fariss, both clerks in the post office, and
Charles Fariss, of Memphis. Four daughters are Mrs. Charlotte Schmid, of
Kentucky; Mrs. Laura Garth of Texas; Miss Pearl Fariss of Memphis, and Miss
Fletcher Fariss of this city.<br>
The funeral service took place at 4 o'clock at the residence this afternoon and
were conducted by Dr. W. T. Haggard. Interment at Rose Hill Cemetery.<br>
