Columbia Herald and Mail, 13 August 1875: &quot;Last week we published in our 
supplement a list of the members of the Maury Greys as it started out. We were 
not able to get a full list of the recruits. The list of casualties is pretty 
correct, kindly given us by Josh G. Bailey, who cut it out of a paper, the 
Mirror, we believe.....&quot;</br>

Maury Democrat, 25 Sep 1900. &quot;Death of Josh G. Bailey. The news of the 
unexpected death of Josh G. Bailey at 2 o'clock a.m. last Thursday received with 
great sorrow in this community where he has lived for so many years. He had been 
suffering more or less for several days, complaining of pains in his head, but 
none thought the end so near. Mr. Bailey was born Dec. 20 1838 in this city, he 
entered the Confederate Army when quite young and made a gallant soldier. He 
always took a great interest in the meetings of Bivouac's, reunions, and 
decorating the graves of the dead boys of the lost cause. Few men had better 
capabilities for business than did Mr. Bailey, and though strong in his likes 
and dislikes he had few enemies and many warm friends. He for a number of years 
was general freight agent here and also conducted an insurance business. Mr. 
Bailey was twice married, first to Miss Calista Hendley by whom he had one 
child, Lee Bailey now grown. He afterwards married Miss Mary Walker of Memphis 
who still survives him and three children. The funeral services were held at St. 
Peter's Church last Friday at 10 o'clock, the church services being conducted by 
Rev. E. Warren Clark, after which the Knights of Pythias and Masons took charge 
of the remains, conveying them to Rose Hill where the last sad rites were held 
over the remains of deceased who was a member of high standing of above orders. 
Peace to his ashes.&quot; <i>Obituary mailed to Mary Bob McClain by Talley Bailey -(<a href="mailto:(critt61626@aol.com">critt61626@aol.com</a>)

</i>Joshua Bailey is buried outside the Confederate group burial section of Rose 
Hill Cemetery. Joshua rode with the 9th </br>
Tn Cav Co A and was captured at Ft Donelson and outlived the war of aggression 
until 15 Sep 1890. His dad was Augustus Bailey and mom Elizabeth Guest Bailey of 
Columbia. Can someone living near Columbia please help me locate </br>
his burial site. His first wife Calista Hendley Bailey is buried in section C of 
Rose Hill but he does not appear to be in that section. Joshua is my second 
cousin twice removed. <i>Talley Bailey <a href="mailto:_critt61626@aol.com">
