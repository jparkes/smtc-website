The Catinna Cabin, which was added-on-to several times, was built by Peter M. 
Catinna b: Dec 1831/(or April 1828). Peter M. was the grandfather of my step 
grandfather Peter N. Catinna b: 17 May 1889. Dad built a house on the hill above 
the Catinna Cabin in 1953 and we lived there till 1960 when we moved to 
Riverside. I lived on W. 9th St. and never knew it was the Old Jackson Military 
Road until a few years ago.<br>

We were near Mt. Pleasant during our visit to TN. Wanted to visit my parents 
graves in Polk Memorial Gardens and see Rattle and Snap Plantation. I have 
driven past Rattle and Snap a hundred times and I decided this trip I would take 
my wife on the tour. As it turned out my aunt went with us and found she had 
been antiquing with the owner several times with one trip to KY. It's a small 
world. [Larry 15 Oct 2012.]<br>
