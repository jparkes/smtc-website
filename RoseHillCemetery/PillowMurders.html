It is sad that three of the four Pillow kin with inscriptions above were for men that
were murdered. Granville Sr in 1868 in Clifton Tn (Maury Co.) and Granville Jr
&amp; William C Pillow were murdered in Leighton AL (where I WA grew up) in
1870. I can see why because there were lots of old antebellum mansions (or
were) around Leighton, Alabama. That I am sure spelled strong support for the
Confederate movement. I wonder if they lived in the old Stanley-Streit
house (decayed now) in my old neighborhood 4 miles northeast of Leighton Alabama. Maybe
not, because Lagrange College is mentioned in the article and that is instead about 4
miles southwest of Leighton Al.</i></br>

Lagrange College was a training ground young Confederates during the Civil War. It was
burned during the federal raids during the war because of that. This was several
years before the Pillow murders. Lagrange College was the forerunner of
University of North Alabama in Florence Alabama, which is still important in the
ROTC (military training of officers) programs.</br>
Remaining there today are historical monuments and cemetery, a beautiful tribute
to a place which ended it history so violently.</br>
I wonder if the two young Pillow men were involved somehow in trying to keep
that college alive in training young minds for future warfare and the federals
put a bounty on their heads, because they were past Confederates. WA 10 Nov

Young Granville Pillow, had married in North Alabama, and had been living there
several years. He was a Confederate soldier and received a wound in the Streight
raid on Sand Mountain (Albertville Al.). Willie (William C. Pillow) went to Alabama a year or so
ago. It is a sad commentary on the evil days upon which we have fallen, that two
such young men should be murdered in cold blood. There is another rumor to the
effect that Granville had received that day in town $800 for the rent of his
farm, and he was robbed as well as murdered. (Columbia Herald, 14 Jan. 1870.)</br>
