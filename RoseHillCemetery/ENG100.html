Margaret Elizabeth Frierson on ancestry.com originally submitted this to Melton Family Tree on 18 Sep 
2010. On the back of this photo is written &quot;grandmother Engle&quot;. C. S. Judd was a 
portrait photographer in Columbia, Tennessee, starting around 1883. Based on the 
age of the subject and the notation of &quot;Grandmother Engle&quot;, I think this is a 
portrait of Margaret, not Laura Engle (who would be a Douglas at this point in 
her life anyway).&quot; </br>
