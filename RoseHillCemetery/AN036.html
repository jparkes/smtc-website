ANDERSON, Joe Ray, Sr. 22 Nov 1930 - 5 Apr 1997. <i>This tall monument is
beautiful. If the base is as small as it looks from here I would not think the
risk of it standing long term is great. The top heavy weight will eventually
bear down on the smaller base and it will then begin to lean and might
eventually topple. Just an opinion. WA 3/9/06</i></br>
