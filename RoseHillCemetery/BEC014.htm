married Elizabeth Altmeyer 16 Oct 1859 in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee. 
She was the daughter of Christian and Katarina Altmeyer and was born 16 Oct 1838 
in Birkenfeld, Germany. She died 17 Jun 1895, probably in Paducha, Kentucky.<br>
On 15 August 1854, Peter, age 18, arrived in New York aboard the ship, American 
Congress, an American Clipper-Ship, having first traveled from Germany to 
London, England. He may have met his brother in New York and they traveled 
together to Nashville or his brother was already in Nashville and he joined him 
there. Whichever it was, Peter met and went to work for his future 
father-in-law, Christian Aultmeyer, making shoes and boots. Both Peter and 
Christian are listed on the 1860 census of Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee 
as shoe makers.<br>
By 1863 both the Altmeyer and Beckenbach families had moved to Columbia, Maury 
County, Tennessee, about 50 miles southwest of Nashville. Here they continued 
their trade of shoe making and all except the oldest of Peter and Elizabeth's 
children were born.<br>

Note: Peter Beckenbach (my great-grandfather) only had one wife but she 
remarried and moved to Kentucky after his death. I've never been able to find 
where she is buried and it never crossed my mind that her sons might have 
returned her to Rose Hill. Her second marriage was a disaster and it is even 
rumored in the family that her sons may have had something to do with &quot;getting 
rid&quot; of her second husband. Family records say that she died in 1895. Her full 
name was Elizabeth Aultmeyer Beckenbach Thompson. Is there any other clue that 
you might know about that would verify that this is her? Suzy &amp; Rob. Is this 
grave next to Peter Beckenbach.)<br>
