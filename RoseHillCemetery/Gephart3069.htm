cemetery researcher Elaine Warren Miller.<br>
</u></font><b><font size="2" color="#660033"><br>
These are surplus stones made available because the above mentioned couple were buried
elsewhere and leaving them sitting in the Rose Hill Cemetery.
They were given to me and I put them in the Harvey Cemetery about 4 or 5 years
ago as a way to reserve two plots.&nbsp; The daughter of Iris gave them to me
after tellng me this
story. Her elderly mother married an older man named Gephart. Mr. Gephart's
daughter was buried in this &quot;family plot&quot; and there were 2 other
stones there. One for the wife and mother of the child and one for him. The wife
(Iris) was buried elsewhere - unknown. Mr. Gephart had married this ladies
mother. When Mr. Gephart died, this lady's mom buried him in her family plot
elsewhere. When her mom died, she had her mom placed with Mr. Gephart and she was left with all these plots deeded to her and only Mr Gephart's
daughter was left there so Mr. Gephart and his original wife then had two stones
that were never used. She deeded the plot to us and I asked if it were okay to
remove those 2 stones and she of course agreed because those two people weren't
buried there. I had the stones stored so we could make good use of the
plots.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
***** When my Aunt Josie wanted two grave sites &quot;reserved&quot; in&nbsp;
Harvey Cemetery what
better way than to park these 2 stones temporarily there. I have every intention to remove
or destroy them at Harvey Cemetery someday when I find the right use for them. *****<br>
There is still a large center headstone with surname GEPHART remaining in Rosehill that
remains surplus. It was too big to move though it may serve the only remaining
Gephart grave there.&nbsp;<br>
 In my research I found 16 tombstones
for confederate soldiers proven to be buried at Rose Hill - exact locations
unknown, but documented to be there. We used the donated surplus plots to put
down stones for the soldiers we are sure are buried at Rose Hill in unmarked
graves, their exact locations unknown.&nbsp;<br>
