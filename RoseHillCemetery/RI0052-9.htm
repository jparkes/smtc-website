Oct 1893 - 17 May 1929, Death Cert shows burial May 18, 1929 in Rose Hill; shows 
burial May 18, 1929 in Rose Hill; but he is not shown among those buried at Rose 
Hill, s/o Madge Whitney &amp; James W. Ridley.<br>
<br>
Joseph Marcus Dedman's brother, Dr. James Edwin Dedman (buried in Oaklawn 
Cemetery, Birmingham, AL) married Madge Whitney (Oaklawn). Madge had been 
married and divorced from James W. Ridley (Rose Hill), and at the time of their 
divorce there were two sons: James Webb Ridley (Jr., our subject) and George 
Whitney Ridley. The two sons were raised by Madge and Dr. Dedman, but eventually 
James Webb Ridley (Jr.) returned to his hometown in Columbia where he sold 
insurance. <br>
<br>
I have attached the death certificate for James Webb Ridley (died May 17, 1929) 
which shows burial May 18, 1929 in Rose Hill; but he is not listed among those 
buried at Rose Hill. The Ridley family has some rather elaborate monuments 
there, but I wonder if he is in an unmarked grave in or around the Ridley plots. <br>
<br>
While James Webb Ridley is an ancillary to my family research, I was curious 
about this. [Jim Dedman 4 Nov 2013]<br>

</font><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Jim I offer no 
solutions as to where James Ridley is buried. I will post the listing to Rose 
Hill and maybe someone will come forward to offer an explanation as to why his 
grave is unmarked. <br>
Also considering the stock market crash of 1929, though I think the worst of it occurred Oct 1929. 
Those were tough times coming off of the prosperity of the roaring 20s.&nbsp; It 
is as if we pay for prosperity with a run of impoverishment to match. This 
happened beginning in 1929 and the economic troubles did not really cease until 
WW II in 1941 when necessity came into play. Often governments try to make this 
economic boom &amp; bust better by imposing autocracy which imposes a kind of equal 
impoverishment on all, such as happens in socialism and communism, and restricts 
freedom of choice. True wealth is brought out by the productivity of the 
citizenry from manufacturing &amp; other forms of creating products and needed services. 
Too much government 
meddling in the affairs of the citizenry is never an answer, and it eventually 
restricts Gross National Product &amp; expands poverty. A form of that is going 
on today in our country.<br>
