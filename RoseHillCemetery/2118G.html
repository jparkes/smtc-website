GARTNER, Tennie T., 19 Jul 1862 - 28 Sep 1898. (d/o J. T. Gartner.) Block "L"<br/>
<br/>
It was with a feeling of deepest sorrow that the numerous friends of Miss Tennie 
Towler Gartner learned of sad and most untimely death, which occurred last 
Wednesday morning shortly after 9 o'clock at the house of her sister, Mrs. 
George Adams, in Nashville. Miss Gartner had been ill for some time and for 
several weeks past had been in Nashville undergoing medical treatment. At times, 
her family and friends had hope for her ultimate recovery, but cruel disease had 
fixed its unrelenting hold upon her, and at last the "angel reaper" came to 
claim its own and gather her pure sweet spirit into the ever filling yet ever 
unfilled garner of God... Deceased was the daughter of the late J.T. Gartner and 
leaves surviving her mother and brothers and sisters, namely -- Messrs. John and 
James Gartner and Miss Amy Gartner of this city and Mrs. Geo. Adams of 
Nashville... [T]he funeral was conducted yesterday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock at 
the family residence, corner North Main and Fifth streets... The burial was at 
Rose Hill Cemetery, to which resting place a long possession followed the form 
of the one they loved in life, and as a last loving token of their affection, 
covered he new made mound with beautiful flowers.... -- Columbia Herald, Sept 30 
1898.<br/>
