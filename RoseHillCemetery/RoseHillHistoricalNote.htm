<u>Blythwood, A brief historical note<br>
</u><br>
</font><font color="#800080"  size="2">One of the returning
Civil War Veteran built &amp; lived in the old home called Blythwood. Blythwood
was located in Columbia on Hatcher Lane right behind McDonald's. That is on (the
main road) Trotwood Ave. going into Columbia across from the Maury Regional
Hospital. My (Mary Bob McClain) mother purchased the place and renovated it
years ago. At the time it needed major renovations, but she salvaged it and
turned it into a nice restaurant. There were beautiful murals painted on the
walls. Some of the original wood furniture was still in place when she purchased
it. One item was a tall elegant Mahogony glass encased book case. The staircase
touched my romantic side because it reminds me of the one in the movie
&quot;Gone with the Wind. The fennel on the stair railing was a faceted solid
lead crystal ball about the size of a cantaloupe. The book case and the fennel
are still (2009) in mother's possession today.<br>
She later sold Blythwood to a bank. I don't know if the place remains today as
it was in my mothers time there.&nbsp;<br>
There was also a secret staircase for the slaves, and hidden rooms for the house
slaves.<br>
It was a beautiful home in it's glory days. I wish I had taken pictures. My
brother Michael restored what was termed the &quot;slave wall&quot; which
surrounded the property.<br>
