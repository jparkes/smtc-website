I have found an error in the web site Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries that you
have based some on the&nbsp; book Maury County, Tennessee Cemeteries compiled by
Fred Lee Hawkins, Jr., Vol 1 pg 421. You might also note that this section of
the book was for names associated with unmarked graves and developed by using a
number of different articles as the source of information. Unfortunately Mr Fred does
not list the article source for the individuals.</b></font></p>

Pickett's charge at Gettysburg. pg. 201, GETTYSBURG LEG, -- Columbia Herald, 9
Jan 1874. &quot;W.R. Elam has been down several weeks again with his Gettysburg
leg. One of his legs was badly wounded in the great charge on the last day of
the great battle of Gettysburg and almost every year since it has welled up and
given him great pain. Mr. Elam was wounded on the enemy's works, after the
Federals had been driven away.&quot;)</b></font></p>

just completed my second visit to Springfield and the TSLA.</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2"><b>His wife Sarah died in 1893 and William
Robert died in 1904. He is originally from Charlotte County, Va and was born
there in 1837 based on census information. Based on the 1860 Census he was in
Maury County at that time working as a merchant. He went back to Virginia to
enlist in the Confederate Army along with J.J. Elam who appears to be a
cousin--unproven at this time.<br>
W R was wounded at Gettsyburg, recovered from the wound and went back into the
service. He was captured at Saylors Creek, near Appomattox Va in April 1965 and
was put in prison at Johnson Island Ohio.<br>
He came back to Columbia after the war and married Sallie Andrews, daughter of
the Mayor of Columbia and by the 1870 census they have 3 living children and by
1880 six living children.<br>
Sallie dies in 1893.</b></font></p>
