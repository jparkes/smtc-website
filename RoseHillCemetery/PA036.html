POINTER, Henry P.
(Capt.), 15 May 1822 - 22 Jun 1892, Block "I", (Staff Officer for
Nathan Bedford Forrest,C.S.A.) The following info was from an article about his
(built 1885) house back in September 05,"Tennessean". It was being
moved. He was captured at Fort Donelson in Feb1862 and sent to Johnson's Island
Sandusky, OH. He was exchanged and went to work as a staff officer for Nathan
Bedford Forrest. He was wounded several times, once near Memphis. He often
negotiated under a flag of truce for the surrender of some of Forrest's
opponents in the War. My Pointers and his are descended from Samuel Pointer Sr.
of Halifax County Virginia, who was born in 1752 and fought in the Revolution.
