  DEATH CLAIMS A SHINING MARK</p>
  <p>WALTER AKIN GEERS DIES FROM HIS INJURIES - IS LAID TO REST WITH FULL 
  MILITARY HONORS / His Death Causes General Sorrow and Profound Regret</br>
  </br>
  No sadder death nor one which has been the source of more profound regret or 
  genuine sorrow has</br>
  occurred in Columbia in recent years than that of Walter Akin Geers, which 
  took place Sunday morning at 3 o'clock at Dr. Pillow's infirmary, where he was 
  taken after being struck by a thrown ball in the base ball game between C.M.A. 
  and Morgan School teams Friday.</br>
  When the news became general Sunday that this promising and popular boy had 
  answered the bugle call of the Great Commander, expressions of sorrow were 
  heard from all sources and all sides. Old men, whose locks were frosted by the 
  snows of many winters, said, when they heard the news: &quot; How much better had 
  one been called whose days of usefulness are well nigh passed.&quot; Younger men 
  gave voice to their regret and said that death had indeed claimed a shining 
  mark. Men and women, friends of the bereaved parents in the olden days and 
  friends of the manly boy, expressed the tenderest pity for the father and 
  mother in the loss of their only son.</br>
  The physicians in charge realized Saturday evening that the end was fast 
  approaching, and death came a few hours later with the father, mother and 
  sisters by his side.</br>

  <p align="center">A Noble Boy</p>
  <p>Deceased was the first boy enrolled at the Columbia Military Academy when 
  the school was first organized. After school began he at once attracted 
  attention by his polite, courteous demeanor and exemplary conduct. He soon 
  attained rank as a student and won the regard of the faculty and student body 
  alike, and more honors perhaps, than any other boy in the school for he was 
  elected Chairman of the Bible Study Class of the school Y.M.C.A, President of 
  the Junior Class, President of the Cosmopolitan Club, the social club of the 
  school, Art Editor of the school Annual, Treasurer of the Athletic Association 
  and Sergeant of the cadet corps; and his popularity spread beyond the confines 
  of the school campus, and he likewise soon became a favorite with the people 
  of Columbia. At the opening of school this morning, Prof. Hardy spoke with 
  deep feeling of the loss sustained by the school, the student body and the 
  faculty. He advised the cadets to take the conduct and life of this fine boy 
  as an example. Prof. Hardy announced that all match games of ball arranged for 
  this season would be cancelled</br>
  in respect to the memory of the deceased.</br>
  </br>
  Military Orders</br>
  </br>
  Major Martin, Commandant of Cadets, issued the following order relative to the 
  funeral:</br>
  </br>
  Headquarters Corps. of Cadets, Columbia Military Academy Columbia, Tenn., May 
  7, 1906.</br>
  General Order No. 21. At 10:30 am the entire battalion of Cadets will assemble 
  in grey uniforms, white belts and gloves, to take part in the funeral 
  procession of late Cadet-Sergeant Walter Geers, the memory of whose exemplary 
  manliness, unswerving fidelity to duty, and altogether lovable character, will 
  always live. The following Cadet-Sergeants will act as active pallbearers: 
  Whitthorne, White, Fry, W., Page, Stephenson, K., and Hazlehurst.</br>
  </br>
  The funeral escort, consisting according to army regulations of fourteen rank 
  and file under the command of a Sergeant, will form on the company parade 
  ground at 10 a.m. and march to the quarters of the deceased, according to 
  Paragraph 499, Drill Regulations.</br>
  </br>
  The following Cadets, under the command of Cadet-Sergeant W. Fleming are 
  detailed to act as an escort: Cadet Corporals Oliver, Brownlow, J., Kinzer,

  </br>
  The rest of the Battalion of Cadets will form on the company parade grounds, 
  and in the funeral procession follow the mourners in order of rank. The Cadet 
  officers wear their sabres, on the hilts of which will be worn the badge of 
  military mourning, a knot of black crape. This badge will be worn for fourteen 
  days.</br>

  Honorary Pallbearers,</br>
  (4) coffin and active pallbearers, (5) mourners, (6) Cadet officers and Cadets

  (Official) D.C. CARUTHERS Cadet Adjutant</br>
  </br>
  Impressive Funeral</br>
  The funeral was held at the First Presbyterian Church at 11 o'clock and was 
  one of the largest and most impressive seen in Columbia in years, and the 
  floral offerings were numerous. Among them was a large pall, covering the 
  coffin, the offering from the student body. The young cadet was laid to rest 
  in his sergeant's uniform, and the silken flag of the school was draped around 
  his coffin. Friends and relatives were present</br>
  from Lynnville, Lebanon and Spring Hill, besides the many who attended from 
  Columbia and the county.</br>
  Rev. W.A. Provine was assisted in the impressive ceremonies by Rev. W.B. 
  Capers and Dr. T.A. Wharton.</br>
  The music was beautiful and touching.</br>
  </br>
  After the ceremony, the funeral procession, under military escort wound its 
  way to Rose Hill, where all that was mortal was laid to rest beside his little 
  sister who died some years since. The interment was with full military honors, 
  and came to a close when the cadets lined up on either side of the grave and 
  fired a parting salute in memory of their comrade.</br>
