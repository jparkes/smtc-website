HARDISON, Joel (M.D.), 5 Aug 1800 - 17 Dec 1873. (Son
of James &amp; Mary)</br>
&nbsp;Another son of pioneer James Hardison, Joel came from North Carolina at
age 11 or 12 and became one of the most influential farmers and citizens of
northeastern Maury County, Tennessee. He was also a physician. He married Jane
Long on 15 Oct 1818. She was the daughter of David Long. Both Joel and Jane had
the distinction of being children of Veterans of the Revolutionary War, since
James Hardison and David Long both served in that conflict. Joel and Jane were
parents of a family of 11 children, among them being Dr. S.T. Hardison of
Lewisburg and Squire Tom also interred in this cemetery with much of his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
