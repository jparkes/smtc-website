JACKSON, M. J., 23 Feb 1848 - 10 Apr 1898.</br>
I would venture based on what I see that M. J. Jackson is the wife of Robert
Jackson. They have identical style stones their birth year is the same and the
death year is within 8 years with the lady living 8 years longer as usual.
Further if I still loved to guess I would say her initials M. J. stood for Mary
Jane, however it might be Martha Jane or Martha Jones or anything. Now Don't go using that data with further proof. Use those kinds of fact
or hunches to add further to other proof of your genealogical proof of
relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
