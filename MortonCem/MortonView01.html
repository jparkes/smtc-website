This is the view of the cemetery standing on the south side and just about where
the photographer started snapping photos. The entrance and signage is on our
right and the cemetery sprawls back the west and our left. This is one of the
best kept neighborhood cemeteries I have seen. the grounds are lovingly
maintained and the stones are repaired and reasonably clean and the rows are
orderly and placed well placed compared to the usual cemetery. My hats off to
everyone here. <br/>

Looking west from the middle-front-southside yields this photo. The exact origin
of Morton Cemetery name is not known. Perhaps the cemetery was started by
Gabriel L. Morton who lived in the area prior to 1840. That does not mean,
however, that there were not other interments before this date. From the
standpoint of number of burials, the name Hardison is most prominent. In fact,
in obituaries of many Hardisons buried here, it is stated that they were buried
in the family graveyard. <br/>
In fact the Hardison's were hardy survivors and knew how to grow thriving boy
babies that grew into reproductive citizens. That is unlike many of our surnames
that seem to die out all too quickly including this researcher family.<i><br/>
