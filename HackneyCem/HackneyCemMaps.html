HACKNEY CEMETERY, (Scotts Mill, Southport) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

Topographical
map shows where the Hackney Cemetery is plotted on the maps. I have not been 
there to confirm this reading of N 35.50869 X W -87.15779.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"></br>

</span></b>To attempt to find this cemetery based on 
the GPS mapping I would:</br>
Go East on Southport Road from Mt Pleasant to Porters and turn (right) southwest 
on old Polk Lane and almost immediately again turn right (south) on Wheelerfield 
Road. Follow Wheelerfield Road about a 1/2 mile and it will bend right (west) 
and in that bend is Bob's lane. Take that going south for a 1/4 mile and fork 
left toward Bob's Lake aka Tailings Pond. and there will be one more left turn 
to take you toward the lake. After the last turn Bob's lake will be in front of 
you so follow the road to and along the north side of the lake. Stop your 
vehicle at the far northeast 
edge of the lake and walk due north about 130 yards to find the cemetery in the 
woods. All this assumes the GPS is correct as marked.</br>
I rate the possibility of it being within 100 yards of the plotted position on 
the map as about 50%, That is the side of a steep slope and Mr. Fred Hawkins who 
has supposedly been there says it is on a high hill. So if that be the case the 
nearest hill spans north and south on the east side of Bob's lake and that would 
be the place to look. So get your climbing boots on and scale to the top of that 
hill. There is a swath of clearing seen on Google Maps along the top of that 
long ridge so when up there go along the ridge looking for 
signs of the
cemetery. Hope you are a mountain man. Your best chance is to find a hunter 
familiar with in that area who knows the location of this cemetery.&nbsp; </br>
Three or four stones are hard to find because many times those are fallen and 
flat on the ground. If you are lucky one or two of them are standing from a 
distance of about 100 feet.</br>
I cannot say if there are locked gates along this route or how much private 
property issues there are to dealt with. I am only studying several maps. I have several photos taken from Southport road toward those 
distant hills in an attempt to spot the Hackney Cemetery.</br>
If you have an Apple I-Pad or smart phone that is small enough to 
tuck into your pocket that gets 4G/LTE network you can follow that looking for 
the cemetery assuming that the GPS is accurate, but that says nothing about all this 
being private land and hazards such as creeks. To do select Google Maps and type 
in the search bar cemetery and Hackney Cemetery will be on of the millions that 
will appear.</br>

</span>With Bing's Birds eye view
Map we see more clearly the trees involved where this cemetery is supposed to be. 
With all the recent wet weather this may now be a jungle by now with no ability to find 
anything remotely as small as a tombstone.</br>
