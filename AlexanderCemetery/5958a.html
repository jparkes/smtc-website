Mr. Thomas "Tom" Sparkman, 81, recording engineer with Mercury and Columbia 
Records, died Monday, September 14, 2009 at his residence on Sixth Avenue.<br/>
Funeral services conducted at Oakes &amp; Nichols with John Vaughan and Wendell 
Robinson officiating. Burial in Alexander Cemetery. <br/>
The Maury County native was the son of the late Alexander Patton "Mr. L." 
Sparkman and Leonie Hardison Sparkman and grew up in the Carter's Creek 
Community. <br/>
Upon graduation from Columbia Central High School in 1945 he entered David 
Lipscomb College. After just a semester, he joined the U. S. Navy, serving two 
years during World War II. <br/>
Following discharge, he completed another year of college at Peabody before 
leaving for New York City to study at the RCA Institute, a technical school for 
radio and television.<br/>
His career in radio began at a Fayetteville, North Carolina radio station but he 
was soon lured back to Columbia with a job offer at WKRM. His next position was 
at Nashville's WSM where he spent 10 years as a studio engineer and did sound 
for the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts before accepting a position with Columbia 
Records.<br/>
As a recording engineer he was "among the cream of the crop," as the artists 
with whom he worked and the awards he accumulated will attest. Patti Page, Tammy 
Wynette, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Patsy Cline, and a young Reba McIntire are 
just a few of the musical legends who depended upon his ears and instinct. He 
received six gold and platinum albums for his work with the Statler Brothers and 
a decade and a half of sessions with Jerry Lee Lewis. He also earned a gold 
record for his work with Bobby Vinton.<br/>
Mr. Sparkman was with the first group of country music artists to play Carnegie 
Hall. He engineered the sound for the show and considered this experience one of 
the highlights of his career. He retired from the music business in 1979 due to 
a hearing loss, but left with no regrets. Mr. Sparkman later confessed that he 
lived a life most people could only dream about. "No one has ever had more fun 
or a more interesting life that I have, because I got to work with some of the 
premier people of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s."<br/>
He was a member of the Maury County Horsemen's Association and Graymere Church 
of Christ.<br/>
Survivors include his wife of 57 years, Bettie Vernon Sparkman of Columbia; 
daughter, Mrs. Susan (Charlie) Ingram of Santa Fe; son, Pat (Marji) Sparkman of 
Riverside, California; grandchildren, Hunter (Marion) Ingram, Anna Ingram, 
Lindsey Sparkman Boyle, Matthew Sparkman, Sabrina Robertson; 
great-grandchildren, Taylor Kay Duran, Hailee Robertson; sister, Mrs. Dorothy 
Coley of LaFayette; and several nieces and nephews.<br/>
He was preceded in death by brothers, Seth Sparkman, Alex Sparkman, and Richard 
Sparkman and sister, Eula Bates Dale.<br/>
Pallbearers will be Larry Dale, Bob Coley, Jim Coley, Hanes Sparkman, Lexie 
Sparkman, and Skip Sparkman. <br/>
Honorary pallbearers include members of the Williams &amp; Riddle Bible Class at 
Graymere Church of Christ.<br/>
