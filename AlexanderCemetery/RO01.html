ROUNTREE, Lillie O., 28 Aug 1872 - 29 Jul 1900</b><b><span style="font-family: Arial"></br>
</br>
Miss Lillie Rountree, daughter of Mr. Charles Rountree, died Sunday morning at 
the home of her father near Carters Creek. The circumstances surrounding her 
death were of a peculiarly sad nature. She appeared in her usual good health 
Saturday, and that evening ate a few bites of ice cream for supper. A short time 
afterwards she was thrown into convulsions and died from the rupture of a blood 
vessel. Deceased was a highly esteemed young lady, and her death brought sorrow 
to the hearts of many. The funeral services took place Monday morning at 10 
o'clock at Beach Grove church, and the interment was in the Lockridge graveyard. 
-- Columbia Herald, 3 Aug 1900.</br>
