GRAHAM, Margaret B., 27 Dec 1801 - 16 Sep 1865. &quot;Wife of Samuel Graham.&quot;<br>
I do not know if Margaret has a stone or not. If so it is buried or under the
earth. Certainly this memorial is for her husband above and often in the olden
days only the head of the household was given a memorial. It was then assumed by
all that the spouse lay beside her husband. That generally was because of the
availability and expense of memorials then.&nbsp;<br>
</b></font><b><font size="2" color="#000080">I can see three different pieces
above and all of them appear to be parts of the memorial for Samuel that was
immersed in a bed of mortar as a salvage restoration project.</font><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080"> <br>
