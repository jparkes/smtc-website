CEMETERY,  MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<img border="0" height="475" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AlexanderCemetery/Alexander1.JPG" width="635"/><br/>
As can be seen from this
photo this is a very old cemetery with stones from the early to late 1800s.
Today it is well kept. However about all of these stones are limestone which is
quite soft and are in sever danger of crumbling with age. Therefore move around
this cemetery carefully. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"><i><br/>

</i>What a gorgeous &amp; historical old cemetery. This photo was made from just
east &amp; back of the one above.<br/>

</i>We are looking at the Boyd, Campbell, Zellner and many other memorials. <br/>

One can see the more modern style granite stones in the distance which are the
more recent ones here. <br/>
