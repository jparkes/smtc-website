Funeral for Richard Hanes Sparkman Sr. of Beech Grove Road, Columbia, was at 2 
p.m. Wednesday at Williamson Memorial Funeral Home, with Myron Keith and Bill 
Miller officiating. Burial was in Alexander Cemetery in Spring Hill. Mr. 
Sparkman died Sunday at the age of 80 in Hillview Nursing Home in Columbia. He 
was the owner of Sparkman Jewelers at 324 Main St. and had owned the store for 
32 years. His son, Hanes, has been running the store for the past five years, 
though Sparkman would lend his expertise and visit with customers until he was 
placed in the nursing home six months ago. He formerly operated a successful dry 
cleaning business, now Fashion Cleaners, in Franklin. To start in the jewelry 
business, he bought two stores in Franklin, the former Franklin Jewelers and the 
former Blackburn Jewelers, and combined them. Sparkman, who until 25 years ago 
lived on Franklin's Buckworth Avenue, bought the place where he was born and 
raised from his brother, Tom. He moved back to Beech Grove Road. Once he was 
back at his home, he won a &quot;couple of bushels of ribbons&quot; on various Tennessee 
Walking Horses. He would enter all the Tennessee shows including the National 
Celebration at Shelbyville plus shows in Orlando, Fla., Baton Rouge, La., 
Montgomery, Ala., Jackson, Miss., and Little Rock, Ark. More than 25 years ago, 
when open heart surgery was new, he was the 15th person to undergo the operation 
at St. Thomas Hospital. Born in Maury County, he was a veteran in the U.S. Army 
during World War II. He was a former city alderman and longtime member of the 
Franklin Rotary Club. He was a member of the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders 
and Exhibition Assn., Tennessee Retail Jewelry Assn. and a member of the Fourth 
Avenue Church of Christ. Survivors include his wife, Mrs. Christine O'Bryan 
Sparkman of Columbia; son, Hanes, and his wife, | Jan, of Franklin; two 
daughters, | Mrs. Bobby (Patsy) Morel of Brentwood and Mrs. Chet (Judy) Travirca 
of Gautier, Miss.; brother, Tom of Columbia; two sisters, Mrs. Eula Dale of 
Franklin and Mrs. Dot Coley of Lafayette, and six grandchildren, Brittan, Meg 
and Hayden Morel, Tripp Sparkman, Keller and Meredith Medlin. Memorials may be 
made to the American Heart Assn.</br>
