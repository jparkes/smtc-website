James C., Dec 1802 - 12 Sep 1857. &quot;Married: 29 Jan 1844. Minister of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; This stone moved from Newsom Cemetery 1979 by J.
Clark Anderson, Lucinda is buried at east little fork beside her 2nd
husband.&quot; (James C. was a gospel preacher; one of the earliest converts of
B.F. Hall, preacher in south central Tn. The following is a statement from B.R.
Hall referring to a trip to Jackson County, Al. in the summer and fall of 1826:
&quot;I went from there to another camp-meeting, higher up in the same county,
where I preached the same doctrine, and baptized a number of persons for
remission, among whom was Jas. C. Anderson, now a very able and prominent
preacher in Tennessee. The following is his own statement of the matter: 'I was
immersed by (B.F. Hall,) together with many others, on the 15 day of September,
1825 or 1826, in the State of Alabama, Jackson county, in Jones' Creek. At the
time he preached faith, repentance and baptism for remission of sins, but not so
fully as it is now preached.&quot; ---Millennial Harbinger, Vol. VII, No. 11,
Nov. 1843, 514.)<br>

&nbsp;The following was written by Tolbert Fanning in the Gospel Advocate: &quot;James C. 
Anderson is no more. He died at his home in Davidson county, Tenn., after 
lingering for some four years, on Saturday, September 12, 1857; aged about 58 
years. He was baptized into Christ by M. W. Matthews in the year 1825, if we 
mistake not; began to preach the Gospel in 1826, and was a bold, fearless, and 
humble teacher of the Christian religion a little over thirty years. From the 
year 1827 till his death, we had not a more intimate acquaintance, and from our 
long and uninterrupted attachment, our deceased brother, before he breathed his 
last, requested that we should attend his funeral. Never did we attend to 
service with a deeper sense of our nothingness before God, and we do not 
recollect to have witnessed more heart-felt sorrow by the many brethren and 
friends who were in attendance. We can say of Brother Anderson what we can say 
of few. When truth and right were the question, policy had not the least weight 
with him. In all the trials we have experienced in Tennessee, James C. Anderson, 
has been an uncompromising advocate of the truth as it is written. He died a 
believer in the power and willingness of Christ, to save him everlastingly. 
Sister Anderson and her orphan children have our sympathy; but we mourn not as 
those who have no hope. Elders E. D. Moore, J. E. Matthews, M. W. Matthews, 
teachers of our deceased brother in youth, are about all who remain, and it is a 
sad thought, that very few of us who have been his companions in the journey of 
life are spared. Blessed be the Lord for the consolations of the Gospel of 
Christ. ---T. F.&quot;<br>
