Margaret Graham stone is supposed to be here but it is evidently under the soil
or broken up.</br>

Samuel, 18 Sep 1799 - 1 Jan 1860. (Stone has been partially restored.) Can see
the 1 of 1799 and that is all in the birth date. June 1 of 1860 is visible in
the death date.</br>

GRAHAM, Margaret B., 27 Dec 1801 - 16 Sep 1865. &quot;Wife of Samuel Graham.&quot;</br>
I do not know if Margaret has a stone or not. If so it is buried or under the
earth. Certainly this memorial is for her husband above and often in the olden
days only the head of the household was given a memorial. It was then assumed by
all that the spouse lay beside her husband. That generally was because of the
availability and expense of memorials then.&nbsp;</br>
</b><b>I can see three different pieces
above and all of them appear to be parts of the memorial for Samuel that was
immersed in a bed of mortar as a salvage restoration project.<span style="font-family: Arial"> </br>
