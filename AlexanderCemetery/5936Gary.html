Andy Gary:&nbsp; &quot;Have you (Wayne Austin) seen a stone in the Alexander
Cemetery for a little girl named Virginia Louise Gary? She was my father's
sister and she died from being burned in an open fireplace fire accident. She
was 5 years old. We have never been able to find her grave. After finding some
clippings in the family papers which indicated that she was buried in the
Alexander Cemetery, I found the cemetery with 23 family members (Garys, Grahams,
and Alexanders). I did not see a stone for little Virginia, but my grandmother
may not have ever had a stone put up. I find this unlikely, but
possible.&quot;&nbsp; [Andy Gary 15 Mar 2009]</br>
&nbsp;</br>
Wayne Austin: &quot;No Andy,&nbsp; I did not find a stone for Virginia Louise.
Therefore most likely there is not one. [Wayne Austin 16 Mar 2009]</br>
</br>
Andy Gary: &quot;I am certain that Virginia is buried in the Alexander Cemetery
because it is known that my grandfather and grandmother, Louise and John Buford
Gary, took the child's body, from Chattanooga where they lived, to the home of
John's father, Samuel G. Gary. I can't imagine that they would have buried the
child anywhere else but in the cemetery in which a good number of Garys were
buried, in including little Virginia's great grandfather, John W. Gary. I would
not be surprised if a stone were not present as that was fairly common under
those circumstances.</br>
Virginia's Dad, John B. Gary had just gotten a job on the railroad in
Chattanooga and they had moved there.&quot; [Andy Gary 16 Mar 2009]</p>
