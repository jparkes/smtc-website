This cropped photo taken from the north wall of he cemetery shows a very
historic home in the far distance. (Private Property Please). Now I don't know its history but know
it is highly likely that the home in the olden days had a colorful history and a
significant association in the role in the founding of this cemetery. Maybe it was in the hands of
the Alexander family in olden days.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: navy"><i></br>
