This old broken stone I dug up and photographed must have been an old original
stone that broke and was replaced in the 1800s by the family of John McMeen for
him. It has his name John McMeen and other readable items including the
&quot;19th of Feb&quot; which is his birth date without the year and a part of
the death date which is &quot;and died _ _ _ 16th&quot;</br>
