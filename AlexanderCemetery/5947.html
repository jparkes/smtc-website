The Life Of William Anderson <br/>
There are many types of good men, as there are many types of great men. Some 
live in humility and meekness and serve their fellow men with quietness that the 
world seldom takes notice of them. Again, they live a useful life in the 
confines of a restricted location. They find so much to do in their immediate 
neighborhood that they seldom venture into other regions they are always busy 
and happy in the service that they can render to their loved ones and to those 
who come within "cable-tow length" of them. William Anderson was a man of this 
type. He was born on October 19, 1848, in Maury County, Tenn. His father was J. 
C. Anderson, one of the pioneer preachers of the Restoration Movement in 
Tennessee. His father was a very efficient gospel preacher, and planted many 
churches in Middle Tennessee and North Alabama. J. C. Anderson died and left a 
widow with five children, two sons and three daughters. William was the older of 
the two sons, and was only nine years old when his father died. His younger 
brother, James, began preaching the gospel, but died soon after reaching 
manhood. William began teaching school at the age of seventeen. He would teach a 
while and then attend school. In 1866, William Anderson obeyed the gospel, under 
the teaching of Tolbert Fanning. He was a student at this time at Franklin 
College. The college was run by Prof. A. J. Fanning at that time. Brother 
Anderson began at once to take part publicly in the worship and gradually 
developed into a preacher. He was efficient as a teacher and preacher. These two 
were beautifully combined in Brother Anderson, and he was successful in both 
causes. Brother Anderson spent his life in teaching and preaching in the county 
in which he was raised. As a teacher he gained the confidence of his students 
and had a great influence over them. He showed true sympathy for his students 
and was interested in their welfare. He was kind and considerate of their 
feelings. He pointed out to them the evils of wrongdoing and the blessing that 
would come to them in right doing. He always appealed to the better elements 
that were in them. His pupils in after life regarded him very highly and loved 
him for the help that he had given them. Brother Anderson and E. A. Elam were 
schoolmates at Franklin College. Brother Elam said of him: "He was a good 
student, and exercised a fine influence." He 'taught school for a number of 
years at what was then known as "Carter's Creek Academy." Many of his students 
became some of the most useful men in Maury County. His influence for good was 
great in their lives. Brother Anderson had made such a success as a teacher, 
that, in the spring of 1901, when Brother J. A. Harding resigned as 
superintendent of the Nashville Bible School (now David Lipscomb College), 
William Anderson was selected by the Board of Trustees to take his place. The 
school made good progress under his direction. He was holding this position when 
the writer entered the Nashville Bible School in 1903. He continued his relation 
to the school until the date of his death. Brother Anderson was an apt teacher, 
a kind disciplinarian, and a congenial friend. He made friends of all of his 
students. He took the time to visit them in their rooms and talked with them 
about their problems. He never left the room of any of his students that he did 
not give them fatherly advice and encouragement in their work. The school 
suffered a great loss in his death. William Anderson was a lover of peace and 
enjoyed the blessings of a "peacemaker." He was called upon frequently to adjust 
differences between brethren. Once he was selected to talk to a brother who had 
been overtaken in a trespass. He and the brother went out to a quiet place" and 
Brother Anderson began in a kind way to talk with him about his mistake. Soon 
the brother showed anger and wanted to know who had told him, at the same time, 
declaring that no one could prove it on him. Brother Anderson replied: "But, you 
know brother, whether you did it or not; it does not need any proof for you to 
know that. It is a matter between you and your God." He soon had the brother in 
tears and penitence. The sin was corrected. At another time he was called upon 
to adjust differences between two brethren. One declared that he was going to 
sue the other for slander; so, when Brother Anderson began to talk to him, he at 
once expressed his determination to sue for slander. Brother Anderson replied: 
"I would not if I were you. I have observed that those who sue for slander 
usually get what they sue for." He prevailed upon the brother to settle the 
trouble out of court. William put confidence in men and believed that all things 
would work out for the good of those who love the Lord. At one time some one 
thought to do him harm by reporting that he was seen to go into a saloon in 
Columbia, Tenn. His friends, of course, denied it for him when they heard it. 
They were anxious for him to denounce the report as false and asked him to 
publish a denial of it in the county paper. He was not disposed to give the 
false report such a public notice and refused to do so. His friends asked him 
what he had to say about it, and he replied: "I'm mighty glad to tell you it is 
not so." This is all that he said and the report died a natural death. Brother 
Anderson had firm convictions. At one time he was called into court as a 
witness. He was asked to hold up his hand and swear. He refused. He said: "I 
will tell you the truth, so far as I am able; but the Bible forbids me to take 
an oath." He was permitted to bear his testimony without the official oath. 
Brother Anderson was a successful teacher, a faithful preacher, a true Christian 
gentleman, a kind friend, and brother in the Lord. He was in usual good health 
the day of his death. On the morning of June 29, 1905, at eight o'clock, the 
summons came suddenly. He had walked to the mailbox about half a mile away and 
had met a brother in the Lord there. They sat down on the roots of a tree and 
began to talk. While talking, Brother Anderson fell over and died instantly. He 
did not speak. His body was laid to rest near his home, where he had lived, 
labored, and loved for more than thirty years. He was not quite fifty-seven 
years old when he died. Brethren David Lipscomb and E. G. Sewell preached the 
funeral sermon. A large audience assembled to hear it. The world needs just such 
men as William Anderson. Such characters are a blessing to any community; such 
men give prestige and influence to any community. The church needs such men as 
Brother Anderson was. He was faithful and loyal to the Word of God, and 
proclaimed it with power and persuasion as opportunity was offered him. Our 
educational system needs such educators as was William Anderson. He taught for 
the good he could do, and not for the money that he could get out of it. He 
endeavored to build character in young people and not merely store away facts 
and dates in their minds. He earnestly desired to make godly men and Christian 
women of all his students. Many are still enjoying the blessings of the 
influence of his life upon them, while he rests from his labors. -Biographical
