<p align="left">The cemetery is 
approximately sized 20x40. I did not find any field stones and did not take a 
picture of the marker with no inscription, but it was a very small stone. 
Elizabeth's stone was hard to read. The John Rice stone had a white circle on the 
marker as seen in the pictures, Alfred's stone is very hard to read, Zurilda's was 
laying flat on the ground and the bottom of it had decayed. I have 2 pictures of 
Bennie, John Rice, Luther Richard, James, Zurilda, 3 of Alfred Buckner, 
Elizabeth and 3 of the cemetery<br/>
[J.B. &amp; Ann Lamar 9 May 2011]</p>

<p>There is one other grave with marker but no inscription and
several marked with fieldstones. As stated in the book Maury
County Tennessee Cemeteries 1988. Mr. Tom Mirabito, Stauffer Plant Engineer
assisted Fred Lee Hawkins Jr during his visit.</p>
<p><i>This publication is based on an on-site visit by JB and Ann Lamar 8 May 
2011. The inscriptions were checked and found to be mostly consistent with past 
publication of records &amp; books.</i></p><p><i>It is
therefore consistent with the records of Maury
County Tennessee Cemeteries by Fred Lee Hawkins Jr., 28 Feb 1988 on page 785. Other publications where information can be found on this cemetery are:
"They Passed This
Way", 1963, by Evelyn Shackleford &amp; Marise Lightfoot, page A-58.
Added here first 15 Jun 2010. Revisions occurred on 14 May 2011 to add the 
photos &amp; information by J. B. &amp; Ann Lamar.  <b>
