</b><b>You will
notice that the Francis Hill Cemetery marked with a red plus is in the brown Strip mining
scarred</b><b>
area.
The TVA transmission towers are I think the best markers to find this cemetery. Just
before one goes into Athendale on Santa Fe Pike as you drive under the
giant steel electrical wiring &amp; towers look to your left and count out to
the 7th steel tower (if my map skills are correct and you can see the 7th tower) and just to the right of that will be the
cemetery. Do not try to get there from Santa Fe Pike because one cannot cross Knob Creek due to its depth.&nbsp;
