<br>
According to family history records of Debbie
Chance, including old letters from family members in Texas &amp; Tennessee these
family members are also thought to be buried here in either unmarked graves or
tombstones that have fallen and sunken beneath the soil and brush. [Info by
Debbie Chance of Mississippi, 15 Jun 2009.]<br>
<br>
<b>IRVINE, John C.</b>, born in Maury Co. in 1836 and died Jan. 31, 1902 in
Maury County. He was never married and was left the homeplace of Charles M. and
Parthena when his dad died.<br>
<b>McMEEN, Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Fannie&quot; Irvine</b>, born 1851 in Maury
County, TN and died 14 Aug 1877. She was the first wife of Lucious Thomas Henry
Hadley McMeen. He had two other wives after Fannie. Fannie died after the birth
of their only child, a girl. We were told the baby died also. The baby would
also be buried here.<br>
<b>McMEEN, Infant</b> (only child) daughter of Lucious Thomas Henry Hadley
McMeen &amp; Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Fannie&quot; Irvine<br>
<b>WISENER, Laura R. Irvine</b>, b. 20 Aug 1846 in Maury County, Tn married John
Watson Wisener 18 June 1874 in Maury Co., Tn and died 25 of June 1880 after the
birth of her third child.<br>
<b>WISENER, Charles A.</b>, the 1st child, is buried here. born 6 Oct 1875 and
died Jul 1876 in Maury County, Tn. According to one of the letters the baby was
about 10 months old when he died.<br>
<br>
It is also possible that our original progenitor to Maury County <b>Christopher IRVINE</b> and <b> his wife</b> are buried in
Harris Cemetery. We have been unable to find where they are buried. It makes
sense that they are buried near their old homeplace.<br>
<br>
Several fieldstones marking graves are obviously related to the above unmarked
or lost graves.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080" >F.L.H., 1987:I found this location almost by accident.
After almost discontinuing my search, I stumbled over the rock wall &amp; thus
the cemetery.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080" >W.A., 2009: This cemetery is located in a large
rock wall big enough to enclose forty to fifty graves. Since it is grown up in
vines and thickets and trees that threaten the memorials with falling
debris.&nbsp;<br>
Because of the brush and fallen logs it is not possible to evaluate this
cemetery to determine if there are more than a few
graves marked with fieldstones. Perhaps there are more memorials that are lost
in the vines. A good application of Roundup would take care of the brush. Do not
do this without the consent of the surrounding land owner. We don't want any
negative environmental issues for livestock or other.
