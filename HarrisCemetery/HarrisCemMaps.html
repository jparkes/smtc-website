Harris Cemetery in the forest. It is adjacent to an old road that runs parallel
with the Old TVA Road.&nbsp;</br>

Instructions 1986: Go west on Santa Fe Pike to Phillipi Church of Christ Road.
Turn right and go 1/2 mile. The cemetery is in deep woods and very difficult to
find, on property owned by Stauffer Chemical Co. It is surrounded by a massive
stone wall.<i></br>
</i>
Instructions today 2009: From Santa Fe Pike turn (right) east up the old TVA
Road. Go&nbsp; past Philippi Church of Christ on the left and climb the hill and
look for a field road to turn left. (all about 1/2 a mile) Take that up the
slope for a hundred yards or so and stop your car and get out and turn 90
degrees from the car direction or road and go in that direction (south) for a
hundred yards. You will then find yourself on a old road which is deep in the
woods. Follow that road for another 100 yards and you will see the stone wall
surrounding the cemetery in a bit of a clearing. That old road runs by the
cemetery on the east side. I would judge the cemetery to be no more than 100
yards due north of the Old TVA Road.</br>
