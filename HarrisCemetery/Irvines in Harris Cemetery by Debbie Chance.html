How exciting to hear back from you! I am happy to share my information<BR>with you. I have copies of old letters that Charles M. Irvine sent to<BR>his son in Texas. Those letters have been a blessing. We found<BR>information in them about the family that we would never have come<BR>across by any other means. I will go back and study the letters to see<BR>if I can find anything else that I may have missed. <BR>This was considered the old family burying ground. There use to be a<BR>house place on the property that mother learned about when she was in<BR>Columbia a year or so ago. We think this will our ancestors home<BR>place-the first Irvine in the area. It is something we are<BR>investigating. In the letters we have, one letter talks about Charles M.<BR>Irvine's will and his son tells the brother in Texas that the place at<BR>Chappell Church is to be sold. Chappell Church was once located near<BR>Harris cemetery and was later moved to the present location.<BR>The following Irvines are buried at Harris Cemetery.<BR>James D. Irvine 1812-1850 He was born in Va and was married to Mary D.<BR>Walker. His children were Joseph Irvine and Crawford Irvine. His father<BR>was Christopher Irvine.<BR>Charles Madison Irvine b. 13 Sep 1809 in Va d. 30 Mar 1887 at Darks<BR>Mill, TN married Parthena Chappell 26 Sep 1831 in Maury Co., TN. His<BR>father was Christopher Irvine. Her parents were William Chappell, Jr.<BR>and Sarah L. Palmer.<BR>Parthena Ann Chappell b. 8 Jul 1815 in Halifax Co., VA and did at Darks<BR>Mill 24 of October 1879.<BR>I am sure that 2 of Charles M's daughters ae buried in the cemetery.<BR>There is at least one grandchild - possibly two buried there.<BR>Sarah Elizabeth (Fannie) Irvine McMeen b. 1851 in Maury County, TN and<BR>died 14 Aug 1877. She was the first wife of Lucious Thomas Henry Hadley<BR>McMeen. He had two other wives after Fannie. Fannie died after the birth<BR>of their only child, a girl. We were told the baby died also. The baby<BR>would be buried here, also.<BR>Laura R. Irvine Wisener b. 20 Aug 1846 in Maury County, TN married John<BR>Watson Wisener 18 June 1874 in Maury Co., TN and died 25 of June 1880<BR>after the birth of her third child.&nbsp; <BR>Their first child, Charles A. Wisiener is buried here. He was b. 6 Oct<BR>1875 and died Jul 1876 in Maury County, TN. According to one of the<BR>letters the baby was about 10 months old when he died. <BR>Laura's descendants are living in Texas and Oklahoma.<BR>Charles and Parthena had another daughter, Anne E. Irvine Vestal, <BR>buried in Vestal cemetery. Her descendants live in Arrington, TN.<BR>There were 4 sons born to Charles M. and Parthena. I believe that John<BR>C. Irvine is buried at Harris Cemetery. He was born in Maury Co. in 1836<BR>and died Jan. 31, 1902 in Maury County. He was never married and was<BR>left the homeplace of Charles M. and Parthena when his dad died.<BR>2 sons: Charles Christopher and William T. Irvine and their families are<BR>buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia. They each have a magnificent<BR>marker on their family lot. The other son, George Washington Campbell<BR>Irvine is buried in Waco, TX with his family.&nbsp; William T. Irvine's<BR>descendants live in TN and MS. This is my mom's line. Charles Irvine has<BR>no descendants as both of her daughters died without having any<BR>children. I have found nothing on George having any descendants in TX. <BR>The fourth son, James Wilson Irvine settled in Lampasas, TX where his<BR>descendants live today. <BR> It is also possible that Christopher Irvine and his wife are buried in<BR>Harris Cemetery. We have been unable to find where they are buried. It<BR>makes sense that they are buried near their old homeplace. More the<BR>reason to get my round up or disel ready before I go back to the<BR>cemetery.<BR>Also, William T. Irvine's sons attended the Web school. They wrote to<BR>the uncle in TN and talked about school. They were attending the school<BR>when it was moved. <BR>These old letters contain information about what is going on in the<BR>community. They talk about deaths and marriages, politics, and the cost<BR>of corn, etc. You really get a feel for the type people they were.<BR>Thanks for allowing me to share. <BR>Debbie Chance<BR><BR><BR><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;WayneAL1@aol.com&gt; 06/11/09 8:26 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Greetings Debbie<BR><BR>Good to hear from you. Yes I do know about the Harris Cemetery. I went<BR>there in April 09 and photographed it. It was scary then to me because I<BR>was<BR>trying to get ahead of the summer chiggers which come out in temps<BR>higher<BR>than&nbsp; 60 degrees and lucky for me I did,&nbsp; though the temp rose to 65<BR>degrees<BR>that&nbsp; day. I don't fear snakes but respect the poisonous ones. Copper<BR>Heads &amp;<BR>Rattlers abound in such places but are rare. Wear boots and that<BR>eliminates<BR>the&nbsp; threat there.<BR><BR>I tell you the best you could do for that cemetery is take a gallon or<BR>so<BR>of roundup with you and spray the whole thing and that should kill the<BR>vegetation that is infesting the inside of the rock wall. After that<BR>more<BR>memorials may turn up there. It is such a big place to&nbsp; have 8 listings<BR>and&nbsp; 6<BR>stones. Surely there are more in the&nbsp; thickets.<BR><BR>Below is Fred Hawkins listing that he made up in 1986. However, I&nbsp; found<BR>a<BR>couple of things he did not.<BR>1. Salina (spelled Selinie on the grave stone) lost an infant&nbsp; probably<BR>in<BR>childbirth because she is buried with the infant. Says so on the&nbsp; bottom<BR>of<BR>the stone. No dates listed so I assume both Mom &amp; Infant child&nbsp; died in<BR>1856<BR>on the same day.<BR><BR>2. Mr Fred did not find the bottom half of James Irvine's stone and I<BR>scratched and probed around and found it. I dug it up &amp;&nbsp; photographed<BR>it. If you<BR>guys did not have his birth and death&nbsp; dates. Now you do on the attached<BR>photo # IMG_1185.JPG<BR><BR>I attached both Irvine memorials to this e-mail and the Harris&nbsp; Cemetery<BR>listing is enclosed below.<BR><BR>I want to use the information in your last E-mail&nbsp; and any other<BR>information from you can scrap up about these folks interred in&nbsp; this<BR>cemetery. If<BR>you have any family history that may enhance the&nbsp; cemetery site it would<BR>be<BR>great to send it in. I plan on posting the Harris&nbsp; Cemetery within a<BR>week or<BR>so. I am working on the Timmons Cemetery just&nbsp; down Santa Fe Pike now<BR>and the<BR>Harris Cemetery is next.<BR><BR>If I can help you re-find the cemetery let me know. It is really easy<BR>now.<BR>Just go up the old TVA Road past Philippi Church and climb the hill and<BR>look for&nbsp; a road to turn left. (all less than a mile) Take that up the<BR>slope<BR>for&nbsp; a hundred yards or so and stop your car and get out and turn 90<BR>degrees<BR>from the&nbsp; car direction or road and go in that direction (south) for a<BR>hundred yards and&nbsp; you will then find yourself on a old road which is<BR>deep in the<BR>woods.&nbsp; Follow that road for another 100 yards and you will see the<BR>stone<BR>wall. That old road runs by the cemetery.<BR><BR>Wayne Austin<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>In a message dated 6/11/2009 12:50:21 P.M.

My mother and I have <BR>visited<BR>the cemetery and ae planning another visit this summer. We live in&nbsp; MS<BR>and have relatives (Wisner descendants) from OK and TX who want to <BR>visit<BR>Columbia while we are there.<BR><BR>Harris Cemetery is located at the&nbsp; top of a hill just off TVA Road.<BR>Mother is much better at this location&nbsp; than me. Phillipi Church is<BR>located at the base of the hill if my memory is&nbsp; correct. The last time<BR>mother was there she talked to a man who was&nbsp; developing the area around<BR>the cemetery. You are now able to drive nearer&nbsp; to the cemetery. Before,<BR>you had to walk. This cemetery has the old stone&nbsp; fence built around it.<BR>Several of our Irvine ancestors are buried in this&nbsp; cemetery. From<BR>copies<BR>of old letters, we learned that several family&nbsp; members were buried<BR>there<BR>and it is referred to as the old family burying&nbsp; ground. We believe our<BR>first Irvine in Maury County, Christopher Irvine,&nbsp; lived nearby.<BR>Christopher has 2 sons buried there and they both have&nbsp; markers. James<BR>D.<BR>Irvine has a marker with a navy insignia on it. Charles&nbsp; M. Irvine and<BR>his wife, Parthenia Chappell Irvine are buried in the&nbsp; cemetery.<BR><BR>I would love to see this cemetery cleaned up. Frankly, when&nbsp; we are able<BR>to visit it's usually in the heat of the summer and I am afraid&nbsp; of<BR>snakes. The area looks snaky.<BR><BR>We will be in the area in July.&nbsp; Mother has been given permission to<BR>check out an old home place on the&nbsp; property. She's 78 and unable to<BR>walk<BR>far so I hope we can get a car close&nbsp; to where she wants to go.<BR><BR>The website is great. Keep up the good&nbsp; work.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR><BR>Debbie Chance<BR><BR>G-G-G-granddaughter of&nbsp; Charles M. and Parthenia&nbsp; Irvine<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>**************Dell Deals: Don't miss huge summer savings on popular<BR>laptops<BR>starting at $449.<BR>(http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221770187x1201425153/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215566131%3B37864407%3B<BR>i)<BR><BR>
