How exciting to hear back from you! I am happy to share my information<br/>with you. I have copies of old letters that Charles M. Irvine sent to<br/>his son in Texas. Those letters have been a blessing. We found<br/>information in them about the family that we would never have come<br/>across by any other means. I will go back and study the letters to see<br/>if I can find anything else that I may have missed. <br/>This was considered the old family burying ground. There use to be a<br/>house place on the property that mother learned about when she was in<br/>Columbia a year or so ago. We think this will our ancestors home<br/>place-the first Irvine in the area. It is something we are<br/>investigating. In the letters we have, one letter talks about Charles M.<br/>Irvine's will and his son tells the brother in Texas that the place at<br/>Chappell Church is to be sold. Chappell Church was once located near<br/>Harris cemetery and was later moved to the present location.<br/>The following Irvines are buried at Harris Cemetery.<br/>James D. Irvine 1812-1850 He was born in Va and was married to Mary D.<br/>Walker. His children were Joseph Irvine and Crawford Irvine. His father<br/>was Christopher Irvine.<br/>Charles Madison Irvine b. 13 Sep 1809 in Va d. 30 Mar 1887 at Darks<br/>Mill, TN married Parthena Chappell 26 Sep 1831 in Maury Co., TN. His<br/>father was Christopher Irvine. Her parents were William Chappell, Jr.<br/>and Sarah L. Palmer.<br/>Parthena Ann Chappell b. 8 Jul 1815 in Halifax Co., VA and did at Darks<br/>Mill 24 of October 1879.<br/>I am sure that 2 of Charles M's daughters ae buried in the cemetery.<br/>There is at least one grandchild - possibly two buried there.<br/>Sarah Elizabeth (Fannie) Irvine McMeen b. 1851 in Maury County, TN and<br/>died 14 Aug 1877. She was the first wife of Lucious Thomas Henry Hadley<br/>McMeen. He had two other wives after Fannie. Fannie died after the birth<br/>of their only child, a girl. We were told the baby died also. The baby<br/>would be buried here, also.<br/>Laura R. Irvine Wisener b. 20 Aug 1846 in Maury County, TN married John<br/>Watson Wisener 18 June 1874 in Maury Co., TN and died 25 of June 1880<br/>after the birth of her third child.  <br/>Their first child, Charles A. Wisiener is buried here. He was b. 6 Oct<br/>1875 and died Jul 1876 in Maury County, TN. According to one of the<br/>letters the baby was about 10 months old when he died. <br/>Laura's descendants are living in Texas and Oklahoma.<br/>Charles and Parthena had another daughter, Anne E. Irvine Vestal, <br/>buried in Vestal cemetery. Her descendants live in Arrington, TN.<br/>There were 4 sons born to Charles M. and Parthena. I believe that John<br/>C. Irvine is buried at Harris Cemetery. He was born in Maury Co. in 1836<br/>and died Jan. 31, 1902 in Maury County. He was never married and was<br/>left the homeplace of Charles M. and Parthena when his dad died.<br/>2 sons: Charles Christopher and William T. Irvine and their families are<br/>buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia. They each have a magnificent<br/>marker on their family lot. The other son, George Washington Campbell<br/>Irvine is buried in Waco, TX with his family.  William T. Irvine's<br/>descendants live in TN and MS. This is my mom's line. Charles Irvine has<br/>no descendants as both of her daughters died without having any<br/>children. I have found nothing on George having any descendants in TX. <br/>The fourth son, James Wilson Irvine settled in Lampasas, TX where his<br/>descendants live today. <br/> It is also possible that Christopher Irvine and his wife are buried in<br/>Harris Cemetery. We have been unable to find where they are buried. It<br/>makes sense that they are buried near their old homeplace. More the<br/>reason to get my round up or disel ready before I go back to the<br/>cemetery.<br/>Also, William T. Irvine's sons attended the Web school. They wrote to<br/>the uncle in TN and talked about school. They were attending the school<br/>when it was moved. <br/>These old letters contain information about what is going on in the<br/>community. They talk about deaths and marriages, politics, and the cost<br/>of corn, etc. You really get a feel for the type people they were.<br/>Thanks for allowing me to share. <br/>Debbie Chance<br/><br/><br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;WayneAL1@aol.com&gt; 06/11/09 8:26 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Greetings Debbie<br/><br/>Good to hear from you. Yes I do know about the Harris Cemetery. I went<br/>there in April 09 and photographed it. It was scary then to me because I<br/>was<br/>trying to get ahead of the summer chiggers which come out in temps<br/>higher<br/>than  60 degrees and lucky for me I did,  though the temp rose to 65<br/>degrees<br/>that  day. I don't fear snakes but respect the poisonous ones. Copper<br/>Heads &amp;<br/>Rattlers abound in such places but are rare. Wear boots and that<br/>eliminates<br/>the  threat there.<br/><br/>I tell you the best you could do for that cemetery is take a gallon or<br/>so<br/>of roundup with you and spray the whole thing and that should kill the<br/>vegetation that is infesting the inside of the rock wall. After that<br/>more<br/>memorials may turn up there. It is such a big place to  have 8 listings<br/>and  6<br/>stones. Surely there are more in the  thickets.<br/><br/>Below is Fred Hawkins listing that he made up in 1986. However, I  found<br/>a<br/>couple of things he did not.<br/>1. Salina (spelled Selinie on the grave stone) lost an infant  probably<br/>in<br/>childbirth because she is buried with the infant. Says so on the  bottom<br/>of<br/>the stone. No dates listed so I assume both Mom &amp; Infant child  died in<br/>1856<br/>on the same day.<br/><br/>2. Mr Fred did not find the bottom half of James Irvine's stone and I<br/>scratched and probed around and found it. I dug it up &amp;  photographed<br/>it. If you<br/>guys did not have his birth and death  dates. Now you do on the attached<br/>photo # IMG_1185.JPG<br/><br/>I attached both Irvine memorials to this e-mail and the Harris  Cemetery<br/>listing is enclosed below.<br/><br/>I want to use the information in your last E-mail  and any other<br/>information from you can scrap up about these folks interred in  this<br/>cemetery. If<br/>you have any family history that may enhance the  cemetery site it would<br/>be<br/>great to send it in. I plan on posting the Harris  Cemetery within a<br/>week or<br/>so. I am working on the Timmons Cemetery just  down Santa Fe Pike now<br/>and the<br/>Harris Cemetery is next.<br/><br/>If I can help you re-find the cemetery let me know. It is really easy<br/>now.<br/>Just go up the old TVA Road past Philippi Church and climb the hill and<br/>look for  a road to turn left. (all less than a mile) Take that up the<br/>slope<br/>for  a hundred yards or so and stop your car and get out and turn 90<br/>degrees<br/>from the  car direction or road and go in that direction (south) for a<br/>hundred yards and  you will then find yourself on a old road which is<br/>deep in the<br/>woods.  Follow that road for another 100 yards and you will see the<br/>stone<br/>wall. That old road runs by the cemetery.<br/><br/>Wayne Austin<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In a message dated 6/11/2009 12:50:21 P.M. Central Daylight Time,<br/>dchance@lauderdale.k12.ms.us writes:<br/><br/>Hello  Wayne,<br/><br/>I have ancestors buried in Harris Cemetery. My mother and I have <br/>visited<br/>the cemetery and ae planning another visit this summer. We live in  MS<br/>and have relatives (Wisner descendants) from OK and TX who want to <br/>visit<br/>Columbia while we are there.<br/><br/>Harris Cemetery is located at the  top of a hill just off TVA Road.<br/>Mother is much better at this location  than me. Phillipi Church is<br/>located at the base of the hill if my memory is  correct. The last time<br/>mother was there she talked to a man who was  developing the area around<br/>the cemetery. You are now able to drive nearer  to the cemetery. Before,<br/>you had to walk. This cemetery has the old stone  fence built around it.<br/>Several of our Irvine ancestors are buried in this  cemetery. From<br/>copies<br/>of old letters, we learned that several family  members were buried<br/>there<br/>and it is referred to as the old family burying  ground. We believe our<br/>first Irvine in Maury County, Christopher Irvine,  lived nearby.<br/>Christopher has 2 sons buried there and they both have  markers. James<br/>D.<br/>Irvine has a marker with a navy insignia on it. Charles  M. Irvine and<br/>his wife, Parthenia Chappell Irvine are buried in the  cemetery.<br/><br/>I would love to see this cemetery cleaned up. Frankly, when  we are able<br/>to visit it's usually in the heat of the summer and I am afraid  of<br/>snakes. The area looks snaky.<br/><br/>We will be in the area in July.  Mother has been given permission to<br/>check out an old home place on the  property. She's 78 and unable to<br/>walk<br/>far so I hope we can get a car close  to where she wants to go.<br/><br/>The website is great. Keep up the good  work.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Debbie Chance<br/><br/>G-G-G-granddaughter of  Charles M. and Parthenia  Irvine<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>**************Dell Deals: Don't miss huge summer savings on popular<br/>laptops<br/>starting at $449.<br/>(http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221770187x1201425153/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215566131%3B37864407%3B<br/>i)<br/><br/></body></html>
