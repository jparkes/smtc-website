Dear Mr. Austin,<br/>
How can I ever thank you for all your hard work in walking cemeteries and
transcribing them for posterity. I am thrilled with the photos of James D.
Irvine's headstone. I am including the following information in order to account
for James D. Irvine's descendants who are definitely not buried in the Harris
Cemetery:<br/>
<br/>
The older son of James D. Irvine: Joseph A. Irvine and Joseph's second wife,
Mary Cross Irvine are buried in nearby Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia,
Tennessee.<br/>
<br/>
My Great Grandfather, Crawford Walker Irvine, James' younger son was born in
Maury County in 1843 &amp; lived there until his death in 1904. He is buried in
with his wife, Annie Eliza Witherspoon Irvine, in Forest Hill Cemetery in
Memphis Tennessee.<br/>
<br/>
My Grandfather, Lucious Matthews Irvine, was born in Maury County in 1880 and
died in Birmingham, Alabama in 1935 where he is buried with my Grandmother,
Alice Hill Irvine, in Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham.<br/>
