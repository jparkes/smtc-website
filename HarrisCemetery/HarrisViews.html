<p align="center"><b>HARRIS
CEMETERY</b><b>,
Santa Fe Pike, right on old TVA Rd, MAURY COUNTY, TENNESSEE<br/>

This is the scene you get as you approach the cemetery (from the east) shown
inside the rock wall ahead. We are standing on the old road and it continues on
our left past the cemetery. Believe this road is good enough to drive on but I
did not see where it came from. It bent northward (behind me about 100 years)
and my car was parked due east of this place </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><img border="0" height="551" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HarrisCemetery/IMG_1165.JPG" width="735"/><br/>
Peering into the
cemetery walled enclosure one can quickly get a feel for the bad shape of this
cemetery. The trees are out of control here. They are springing up, growing tall
and then they will come crashing down on the memorials threatening them with
breakage.<br/>

</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Here
we can see a couple of </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">the memorials
in the center of the cemetery protruding above the vines. This area is </b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">surrounded</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
by a large rock enclosure over a 1/4 to 1/2 acre area. <br/>
There are so many dangers to memorial in this place. I recently had to add fire
to the list of threats to memorials in this environment, because fire will burn
the stones and subject them to becoming brittle and cause them to disintegrate
in time.<br/>

Here we see the two mentioned memorials along with a third one. These are the
Harris memorials. The two Irvine memorials are on different ends of  the
cemetery.<br/>

In this photo we see the (light colored spot) top of the James Irvine memorial
at the tip of the indicated black arrow. It is just below a large tree trunk.<br/>
