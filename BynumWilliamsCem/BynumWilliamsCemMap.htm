This map was made before the business development real estate area that now occupies this
place. It is based on the map coordinates shown above that I have developed to 
show the GPS location of the Bynum-Williams Cemetery. This is correct. If you 
see any other Bynum-Williams Cemetery locations throw them out this is right and 
correct the others are wrong even if they belong to the USGS Mapping service. 
There is not two Bynum-Williams Cemeteries. End of discussion.<br>

This road map was modified to show the roads back into the (Cherry Glenn) 
Industrial Park because that is the route you follow to get to this cemetery. In 
essence after turning into the industrial park take all the 1st available left 
turns and find the cemetery in back &amp; southwest of the Firestation #2 about 100 
yards not yet opened as of this moment.<br>

style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> is a different way to get to this cemetery 
today. Old locations prior to this should be ignored forever. So turn left into 
the Sam Watkins Blvd next turn left into the Joe Frank Porter Rd and then turn 
left into the Charles Fisher St and pass the Fire station. It is behind and just 
past that fire station marked by a black check on the left again. [CWA 5 Apr
