To add a little to your Bynum research, Elizabeth Timmons, daughter of&nbsp; <BR>Hannah and William Timmons, married Buffin Bynum on 13 January 1830 in Maury&nbsp; <BR>County, TN. Next to William Timmons lived Young Bynum who I assume was the&nbsp; father <BR>of Buffin. The 1830 census shows Young between 60-70, but I think&nbsp; Elizabeth <BR>and Buffin were living with her parents that first year of&nbsp; their marriage. It <BR>seems Buffin died before 1840 when Elizabeth and daughters&nbsp; Elizabeth and <BR>Frances apparently were living with William and Hannah.&nbsp; Daughter Elizabeth Bynum <BR>married Joel Goad on 1 August 1849. The 1850 census has&nbsp; Hannah Timmons, age <BR>76, with Elizabeth Bynum, 48, and Frances Bynum, 16, in the&nbsp; household (William <BR>died between 1845-1850). Separately, Joel Goad, 27, and Eliza&nbsp; Goad, 18, were <BR>living very close to the Timmons' families along Santa Fe Pike, a&nbsp; few miles <BR>northwest of Columbia.<BR> <BR>On another point I do not believe Calloway County, KY was ever part of&nbsp; <BR>Hickman County, TN.<BR> <BR>Good hunting!<BR> <BR>Bill Timmons<BR><BR><BR><BR>**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>(http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025<BR>48)<BR> <BR>-------------------------------<BR>To unsubscribe from the list, please send an email to TNMAURY-request@rootsweb.com with the word 'unsubscribe' without the quotes in the subject and the body of the message<BR>
