To add a little to your Bynum research, Elizabeth Timmons, daughter of  <br/>Hannah and William Timmons, married Buffin Bynum on 13 January 1830 in Maury  <br/>County, TN. Next to William Timmons lived Young Bynum who I assume was the  father <br/>of Buffin. The 1830 census shows Young between 60-70, but I think  Elizabeth <br/>and Buffin were living with her parents that first year of  their marriage. It <br/>seems Buffin died before 1840 when Elizabeth and daughters  Elizabeth and <br/>Frances apparently were living with William and Hannah.  Daughter Elizabeth Bynum <br/>married Joel Goad on 1 August 1849. The 1850 census has  Hannah Timmons, age <br/>76, with Elizabeth Bynum, 48, and Frances Bynum, 16, in the  household (William <br/>died between 1845-1850). Separately, Joel Goad, 27, and Eliza  Goad, 18, were <br/>living very close to the Timmons' families along Santa Fe Pike, a  few miles <br/>northwest of Columbia.<br/> <br/>On another point I do not believe Calloway County, KY was ever part of  <br/>Hickman County, TN.<br/> <br/>Good hunting!<br/> <br/>Bill Timmons<br/><br/><br/><br/>**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.     <br/>(http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025<br/>48)<br/> <br/>-------------------------------<br/>To unsubscribe from the list, please send an email to TNMAURY-request@rootsweb.com with the word 'unsubscribe' without the quotes in the subject and the body of the message<br/></body></html>
