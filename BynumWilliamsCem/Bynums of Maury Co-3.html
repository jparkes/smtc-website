To add a little to your Bynum research, Elizabeth Timmons, daughter of&nbsp; </br>Hannah and William Timmons, married Buffin Bynum on 13 January 1830 in Maury&nbsp; </br>County, TN. Next to William Timmons lived Young Bynum who I assume was the&nbsp; father </br>of Buffin. The 1830 census shows Young between 60-70, but I think&nbsp; Elizabeth </br>and Buffin were living with her parents that first year of&nbsp; their marriage. It </br>seems Buffin died before 1840 when Elizabeth and daughters&nbsp; Elizabeth and </br>Frances apparently were living with William and Hannah.&nbsp; Daughter Elizabeth Bynum </br>married Joel Goad on 1 August 1849. The 1850 census has&nbsp; Hannah Timmons, age </br>76, with Elizabeth Bynum, 48, and Frances Bynum, 16, in the&nbsp; household (William </br>died between 1845-1850). Separately, Joel Goad, 27, and Eliza&nbsp; Goad, 18, were </br>living very close to the Timmons' families along Santa Fe Pike, a&nbsp; few miles </br>northwest of Columbia.</br> </br>On another point I do not believe Calloway County, KY was ever part of&nbsp; </br>Hickman County, TN.</br> </br>Good hunting!</br> </br>Bill Timmons</br></br></br></br>**************Biggest Grammy Award surprises of all time on AOL Music.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </br>(http://music.aol.com/grammys/pictures/never-won-a-grammy?NCID=aolcmp003000000025</br>48)</br> </br>-------------------------------</br>To unsubscribe from the list, please send an email to TNMAURY-request@rootsweb.com with the word 'unsubscribe' without the quotes in the subject and the body of the message</br>
