<br>
Hello, Does anyone know anything about Tapley Bynum &amp; wife Anne Rickman
Bynum that lived for a while in Maury Co TN. Supposedly I have found that Anne
died there between 1820-1830. I would very much like to find evidence of her
death and hopefully where she is buried. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>From Betty Weaver, Georgetown, TX (okie@gtwn.net),
8/2001: Your William who married Winifred Horton is the brother of my Luke who
married Sarah Horton.? But where did Ann Bradford come from&gt; I have never run
across her.? All the information says that Anne Rickman or Richman was Tapley's
wife and no mention of Ann Bradford.? What do you have on her?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>I got your address from the Maury County
web site. I am the daughter of Vera Bynum dau/o Tapley Bynum s/o William W.
Bynum s/o Luke Bynum s/o Tapley. Luke Bynum was married to Sarah Horton when the
extended family moved to Maury County about 1818. Sarah died and Luke married
Margaret Clark before they moved to Kentucky. Luke had about 13 children, eight
of whom we have identified. Now to what I need to find out: either a death date
for Sarah or a marriage date for Margaret, as well as names of other children.
Descendents that I have talked to all divide the children up in different Ways.</b></font></p>
