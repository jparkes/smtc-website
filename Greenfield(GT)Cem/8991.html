After some brush removal one can see at the bottom of the photo the Capt Thomas

This is the top section of the tumbled stone for Dr. James Thomas Sanford
Greenfield, It is adjacent to the box tomb for Thomas T. Greenfield. Much of the
memorial is buried under the ground and will need digging up in any restoration
effort. His wife's Frances's memorial shown below is in back of us and also
needs to be dug out, reset &amp; cleaned.&nbsp;</br>

</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">GREENFIELD,
Frances Ophelia Potts, 1847 - 1888, wife of J. T. S. Greenfield.</br>
GREENFIELD, J. T. S. (M.D.), 17 Sep 1831 - 24 Sep 1899. (Son of Dr. Gerrard T.
&amp; Keran T. Sanford Greenfield.) (stone fallen, dislocated and covered in the
dense brush with debris. This 500 lbs stone was face down and unable to be
photographed)</br>
</br>
</span>Dr. James Thomas Sanford Greenfield, was
born 17 Sep 1831, son of Dr. Gerrard &amp; Catherine (Keren T.) Sanford
Greenfield. He followed his father into the medical profession, graduated from
the Univ. of Pennsylvania in 1851 and returned to his native Maury County to
practice. He married Frances O. (Potts) Lavender in 1884, and they produced
three children.</br>

</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">I
wonder why the stone for Frances Greenfield has never been reported by previous
researchers. Maybe it was buried in the soil when Mr. Fred Hawkins came thru
here in 1987 or maybe the stone was set since 1987. The former statement is
probably correct since this does not look like a stone that was set since 1987.</span></br>
