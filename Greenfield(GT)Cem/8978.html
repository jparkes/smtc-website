Truman Greenfield, a Revolutionary War Soldier, Revolutionary War Military

(muddy) groundhog.</br>

A sneak peek at the original box tomb of Thomas T. Greenfield. It was a major
task to uncover enough of this top to make this photo. It still is largely
unreadable.</br>

We can see the memorial better here resting on the end of the box tomb slab.</br>

Capt. Thomas T., 1744 - 15 Nov 1825 at residence of his son, Dr. G. T.
Greenfield, in the 81st year of his age. Capt Calvert County Maryland Militia.
REVOLUTIONARY WAR SOLDIER.</br>
</br>
Captain Thomas Trueman Greenfield. &quot;Native of Maryland, but for many years
a resident of Tennessee. The deceased was one of the earliest patriots of the
Revolution. He was never known through the course of a long life to lift his
hand against his fellow man except in self defense and defense of his country.
His friends have the consolation that</br>
he died a Christian in full expectation of enjoying a better and brighter
world.&quot; (Epitaph on his box tomb.)</br>

closely at these photos if you did not think it tough to fight the thorns and
brush using a bush whacker to get these photos. God gave me the training and
talent for that and I enjoy doing this in spite of the difficulty, expense and
millions who could or would not tackle such a tough situation. My only regret is
having to leave these cemeteries behind in such sad shape. Because there are so
many of them it is not possible for one person to clean all of them so the focus
is upon getting a readable photo.&nbsp;</span><i></br>
