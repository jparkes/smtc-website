<p>1987: This cemetery has been repaired and well
maintained these past years and is nicely fenced. [Fred L. Hawkins.]</br>
</br>
2009: This is a very historic cemetery in the western tier of Maury County. In
today's dollars there are at least $300,000 in beautiful structures and
monuments enclosed in a brick wall capped off with custom cut limestone. On top of the
limestone blocks are set in place ornamental iron spiral fencing inserted into
the center slots composed of shaped tops. The front gate consisted of two tall
decorative limestone post.&nbsp;</br>
Well, at least
it was beautiful at one time when the brush was clear. This cemetery is now
completely abandoned and the bushes and trees are growing profusely uprooting the stones and rendering the
Brick &amp; Stone Fence unstable.
If left unchecked the brush will totally destroy this cemetery in 50 years. It
is a travesty that we allow such total abandonment to happen to the resting
places of those who made severe sacrifices to found this country so we can
enjoy the freedoms we have today. Is this a lack of respect for freedom? What do
you think? It certainly is a lack of something. We are not that busy. 20 minutes
a month from some nearby person would reasonably maintain this cemetery. [WA 24

<u>GREENFIELD BEND</u></p>
<p>Several miles before Duck River leaves Maury
Co. on its meandering but westward journey, it forms one of the biggest of
several long and sinuous curves. Inside this largest loop is the area known as Greenfield Bend. Much of the land in the Bend is
river bottom land and some of the finest in the County. It was here that the
Greenfield's acquired some 4,200 acres about 1812 and this pioneer family was soon joined by
families with the surnames such as Delk, Hopkins, Cherry, Walker, Love, Hawkins,
Shelby, Mayfield and others. Mr. Walker built
the first brick house in Maury County, it is reported. That section of the river
land was then later named Brickhouse Bend. As can be seen, the old
family graveyards still stand as witnesses to the passing of these pioneers.</p>
