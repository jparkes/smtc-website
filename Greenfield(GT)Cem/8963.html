Tee Greenfield, 10 Jun 1870 - 4 Apr 1893. (One of the many young married ladies
that died young in the olden times related to child bearing.)<br/>

closely at these photos if you did not think it tough to fight the thorns and
brush using a bush whacker to get these photos. God gave me the training and
talent for that and I love doing this in spite of the millions who could or
would not tackle such a tough job. My only regret is having to leave these
cemeteries in such sad shape. Because there are so many of them it is not
possible for one person to clean all of them so the focus is getting a readable
photo.Â </span><i><br/>
