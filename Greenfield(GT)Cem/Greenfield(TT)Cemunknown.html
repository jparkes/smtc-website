<p align="center"><b>GREENFIELD
(THOMAS TRUEMAN) CEMETERY, Greenfield Bend Road (West) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Greenfield(GT)Cem/uIMG_8975.JPG" width="651" height="490"></br>
</b>In this photo we see the footstone out from the center for the grave of G.T.
Greenfield. Nearer the bottom we see the corner of a stone protruding from the
ground marking the grave of an unknown interment. Due to the ground being
covered in brush I did not get a good view, but believe there were no other
unknown fieldstone markers depicting graves of lost souls at least lost as to
who they were to us.</br>
