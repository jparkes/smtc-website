<DIV><STRONG><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size=2>Thanks for the reply. If 
you are traveling North on US 31 through Waco, the Dr. Smith house is the third 
house on your right of US 31 from the intersection of 31 and the Lynville road. 
It is brick and well kept. At one time I understand that it had wings both North 
and South. I have no idea who removed them.</FONT></STRONG></DIV>

<DIV><STRONG><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size=2>I suffered with back 
trouble for years. I finally broke down and went to chiropractor who remedied my 
trouble. The chiropractor was the last resort before surgery.

<DIV><STRONG><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size=2>I understand the 
frustration that can come with a computer. I recently switched from Comcast to 
Bellsouth as my server and have some difficulty with the modem which was 
supplied. I'm also</FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" 
size=2>&nbsp;having trouble with our wireless router. My son's computer is 
located across his house some distance from my computer and I also have an old 
laptop&nbsp;my wireless network. I have tried several routers and finally 
settled on a Belkin which is supposed to be 8 times stronger than others. It 
worked fine for several months and then became intermitten and finally "died." 
The manufacturer sent me a brand new replacement but I have not been able to get 
it working. Tim Kinzer who worships with us is a computer guru and I'm gonna' 
have to get him to come get me straightened out.</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size=2>He told that it probably 
had to to with encription which&nbsp;I know nothing about but maybe I'll learn.
