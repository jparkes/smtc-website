Writings From: Jack Dugger, born 1918:</b>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">My
great grandfather was&nbsp;Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith who practiced in Giles
County at Waco/Lyn</b></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">n<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">ville. A fellow named Matthews has recently purchased
<a href="SmithHouse.htm"> his old
home/office at Waco</a> and is trying to get it on the National Register. He, as
well as some lady whom he has hired to get this done, have contacted me several
times for information on the old house. During my lifetime, I have passed by the
old house many times but really know very little about it.&nbsp;In fact, we have
never been able to trace his lineage beyond Waco. The Historical Society of
Giles County tells
me that he&nbsp;was reported to have&nbsp;come&nbsp;to Tennessee from South
Carolina and some siblings came with him. Nobody has been able to identify</b></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;his
siblings although there are a number of Smith families in that area. I do know
that he was married three times and had children by all three wives. The
tradition is that he was shot by Union Soldiers when they were raiding his
henhouse at night. My mother always doubted that. She thought that a
neighbor shot him because he had been too familiar with his wife.</b></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">**&nbsp;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
We know he died at age
51. The historical Association only says that he was murdered at age 51.
Supposedly he was buried in the </b></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">old

Daniels Cemetery off of the Moorseville Pike
in an unmarked boxtomb. There is an unmarked slab next to his first wife's
grave which is clearly marked and has the same type of slab over it. </b><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Jack
