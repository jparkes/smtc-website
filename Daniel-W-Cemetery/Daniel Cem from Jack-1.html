<div><strong>Haven't heard from you in 
some time. I had about six weeks of a very serious cold/virus or whatever has 
been going around. About two weeks later, I've got ther same thing again. Tried 
to tell my doctor that I must have the bird flu but didn't convince him of 
that.</strong></div>

<div><strong>Hope you escaped the 
tornadoes that have devastated a number of areas around here. Fortunately, none 
of them hit our immediate area.</strong></div>

<div><strong>Had e-mail from 
Dianne Taplin today. She said that it was baby chicken time in Alaska 
and she's been busy with that. I did not know that she sells health foods in 
addition to the feed, etc., store. Living in that State must be interesting but 
seems like an entirely different life-style to what we are 
accustomed.</strong></div>

<div><strong>My great grandfather 
was Dr. Benjamin Franklin Smith who practiced in Giles County at 
Waco/Lynville. A fellow named Matthews has recently purchased his old 
homé/office at Waco and is trying to get it on the National Register. He, as 
well as some lady whom he has hired to get this done, have contacted me several 
times for information on the old house. During my lifetime, I have passed by the 
old house many times but really know nothing about it. In fact, we have 
never been able to trace his lineage beyond Waco. The Historical Society of 
Giles County tell sme that he was reported to have come to 
Tennessee from South Carolina and the some siblings came with him. Nobody has 
been able to identify</strong> <strong><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">his siblings although there are a number of 
Smith families in that area. I do know that he was married three times and had 
children by all three wives. The tradition is that he was shot by Union Soldiers 
when they were raiding his henhouse at night. My mother always doubted that 
because she thought that a neighbor shot him because he had been too familiar 
with his wife. He died at age 51. The historical Association only says that he 
was murdered at age 51. Supposedly he was buried in the old Daniels Cemetery off 
of the Moorseville Pike and in an unmarked tomb although there is an unmarked 
slab next to his first wife's grave which is clearly marked and has the same 
type of slab over it. I don't recall that you have worked on that 
Cemetery.</font></strong></div><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">

<div><strong>For several years I have 
been writing a "Saga" of my life. At the rate I'm going, it will never be 
finished before I die. I keep adding to it when I think of something that ought 
to be in it. It is not written for publication-just for my own family. In some 
ways my life has been rather eventful and looking ay it from another standpoint, 
it has been most uneventful and not very productive. </strong></div>
