<font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>The Brown Cemetery may be
found by turning off of Hwy 431 onto Hardison Mill Road about a mile south of
Pottsville. Hardison Mill Road makes a sharp left turn and from there go to the
first entrance on your right. The cemetery is located behind what was in 1986
the home of Mrs. Edward Peay. It is about half way between the river and
Hardison Mill Rd. marked above by the black arrows. If these instructions don't
work notice in the topographical map the cemetery is located at the end of a plateau on the
south side about 400 yards west of the road.<i><br>
Information by Fred Hawkins in 1986 and map by Wayne Austin Feb 2006 modified
from MS Terra site</i>.</b>
