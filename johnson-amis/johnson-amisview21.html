This
is a (2009) restored view of the cemetery with the rock wall enclosure now
standing up repaired. <a href="johnson-amisviewbefore.html"> Click here for a Before restoration look</a>. The brush has been reduced to a beautiful garden look, and
all of the stones standing up which were fallen in the past. So many
improvements were made that the cemetery does not look like the same place when
I was there.<i><br/>
