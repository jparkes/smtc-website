A
view looking northwest across the cemetery from a position further north than
photo before the last one. Out in the upper left is the stand up stone of Lewis Amis &amp; two of his sons inscription on
one stone, one of which
died from wounds received in the Civil War and is buried in Georgia. Between us
and the Lewis Amis stone is the box tomb of Jonathan David Hunt an infant. The
other 6 box tombs further out two complete tops and four broken ones are in memory of the small children of Lewis &amp;
Louisa Y. Amis and one for the Walker family infant. That white round
object in the right center of the photo is a giant mushroom. Largest one I have
ever seen with an approximate diameter of 11 inches and globular shaped.  </b></center><center><b><i>
