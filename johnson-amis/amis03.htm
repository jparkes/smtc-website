<b><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">AMIS, Louise Y. (Yeoman) Johnson,
dates unknown. (The wife of Lewis Amis and daughter of Alexander &amp; Mary
Johnson and mother of at least seven children who have inscribed stones in this
cemetery is likely buried here.)&nbsp;Possibly this stone is the unmarked stone
of Louisa Y Amis but the proof is scant except the grave is in the same row as
is that of her husband and two of the sons who died during or shortly after the
Civil War one known to have died from battle wounds. At one time this stone
could have been marked. If in fact it is Louisa's marker and it is older than
his. That
means she died long before her husband. If these are all her children then J. D
was born in 1849 so we know her death had to be after that assuming she was the
only wife of Lewis. </font>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This stone might also be
the memorial stone of Jones Kendrick an owner of one of the 5,000 grants of
land. Many of the early stones (1810-1830) in the county have that round look as the one
above. For more on that see page 496 of Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries by
Fred Hawkins. </font></b><center><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><i>Photo &amp; info by
