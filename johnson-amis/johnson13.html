<b>JOHNSON, Alexander, 16
Apr 1782 - 7 Feb 1857 (74-10-07.) (Son of William &amp; Sarah; born in N.C.;
"He served as Magistrate in Maury Co., Tn. for many years."</b></center><b>
There is actually an old box tomb under the base for the above stone with the
vital inscription about Alexander. It also includes a statement that Alexander
served as Magistrate of the County mentioned above. Possibly the family later
replaced the old box style stone with this upright stone and included
Alexander's wife Mary on the above stone on the back side or the side now turned
toward the soil. "ALEXANDER JOHNSON Born April 16th 1782 Died February 7th
1857 Aged 74 Years 10 Months and 7 Days." </b><center><b>
