<p align="center">I have assembled two
parts of a two different box tomb and set them together as if they were one. As
you can see about half way down the photo the fault lines do not match up.&nbsp;
The first box tomb has this which is readable: &quot;Lewis &amp; Louisa Y Amis
erected this stone in memory of their only _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot;. For the second
box tomb (bottom I cannot make any whole thoughts out just a few words: &quot;_
_ _ _ _ appointed for all _ _ _ _day of August _ _ _ _&nbsp; tender age of _ _
_&nbsp; years &amp; _ _ _&nbsp; days. _ _ _ the lovely _ _ __ _ _flower _ _ _
solace_ _ _ _.&quot; These are likely the Box tombs found by Mr Fred for the
stone of John Alen J. and Eliza Ann Amis.
The other loose stones around are the base or support stones for the broken tops
above.</br>
