CEMETERY-CULLEOKA TENNESSEE</b><center><b><img border="0" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/johnson-amis/IMG_1795.JPG" width="718" height="539" ></br>
A
view looking northwest across the cemetery from the southern position. The two old
stones of the Johnson Family are in your center view. On the right is the later
base of the stone (fallen) of Alexander Johnson and his wife Mary.</b></center><b>
notice the many decaying or fallen trees in the cemetery. That is normal but a
threat to the memorials. The trees drop heavy limbs on the stones and break
them up. Trees are good in the cemetery, but they need to be selected and allowed
to flourish based on their strength and vitality. </b><center><b><i>
