This
is a a topographical map showing the Johnson-Amis Cemetery in Culleoka
Tennessee. There is now a road spanning northwest (see next Aerial View) to aid the school traffic there.
The new road cuts to the left of the cemetery thicket. Looking from Valley Creek
road the Cemetery appears to be just another thicket of trees, but thanks to the
efforts of a group of young restorers it has the real look of a cemetery now.<i> Wayne Austin

</i>This photo was taken from Valley Creek Road and marks the spot where the
cemetery can be found looking northwest or toward your right traveling toward
Hwy 31. I challenge the teachers and leaders of the nearby school to take the kids on a
visit to this cemetery and teach them of the beauty, the educational value and
of the need to preserve the history &amp; heritage of this old cemetery. Show
them that cemeteries can fuel our educational curiosity about who we are and why
we are on this on earth. Teach them that these
old family cemeteries are not just clumps of rocks and bushes near the school to 
be ignored and destroyed at whim by the first disturbed child that happens upon 
the site. <i>&nbsp;The challenge was accepted by the Baseball team which did a 
super job restoring this cemetery March 2009 as depicted in other sections of 
this publication.
