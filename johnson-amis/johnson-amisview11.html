A
view looking northwest across the cemetery from the west wall. The cemetery has
been lightly weeded and stones uncovered and photographed. Out in the left
center is the stand up stone of Lewis Amis &amp; two of his sons one of which
died from wounds received in the Civil War and is buried in Georgia. Between us
and the Lewis Amis stone is the box tomb of Jonathan David Hunt an infant. The
other box tombs further out are in memory of the small children of Lewis &amp;
Louisa Y. Amis many of which are broken up. In our near view is the fallen
memorial of Alexander &amp; Mary Johnson composed of four parts: (1) the large
base resting on the older abandoned Box tomb and (2) a small cap further left
almost covered in brush and (3) a block that contains the inscription just the
left of the large base, and (4) the shaft lying on the ground behind the base. </b></center><center><b><i>
