A
view looking northwest across the cemetery from the west wall. The cemetery has
been lightly weeded and stones uncovered and photographed. Out in the center is the stand up stone of
William Johnson and his wife Sarah. Between us
and the William Johnson family stones in our near view is the fallen
memorial of Alexander &amp; Mary Johnson composed of four parts: (1) the large
base resting on the older abandoned Box tomb and (2) a small cap further left
almost covered in brush and (3) a block that contains the inscription just the
left of the large base, and (4) the shaft lying on the ground behind the base. </b></center><center><b><i>
