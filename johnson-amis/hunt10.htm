<b>HUNT, Jonathan David, 29
Apr 1836 - 28 Sep 1838 �infant son of Jonathan S. &amp; Frances M. Hunt.� In
Memory of Jonathan David HUNT infant son of Jonathan S &amp; Frances M. HUNT.
Born April 29th 1836 Died Sep 28th 1838 Beneath the ground thy dust shall lie
till Michael's trumpet shall bend the sky. _ _ _ _ _&quot;. Long poem. The
lettering became smaller as it approached the bottom edge of the stone and also
became very difficult to read. Dr. J. S. Hunt and his wife Frances are buried
Wilkes Camp Ground Cemetery which may tell us that they moved across town later
and lived nearer to the Old Campground Church &amp; now just a Cemetery where
they are buried. He died in 1860 and she died in 1882. This is in the row to the
east of the row of Amis children's box tombs that are lined up north to south.</br>
