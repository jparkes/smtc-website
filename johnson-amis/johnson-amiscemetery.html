<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center">
<span style="color: #800000">Johnson-Amis Cemetery is located on the fringes of
Culleoka across from the new baseball field. It is enclosed in a rock wall. Coming out of
Culleoka and after passing
the railroad tracks&nbsp; turn right off of Valley Creek Road onto the new
school road and </span>look to your right for the Rock Wall &amp; Cemetery.
You will not see the rock wall unless is it winter time. The cemetery is in a sad condition now. Mr. Hawkins visited there in 1987 and reported
several box tombs were in good shape. Today however there is only four surviving
box tomb tops with the others having been smashed by vandals.</br>
 I tried to
reassemble the broken parts to be able to photo the inscription but had limited success
in doing that because there were so many small fragments and missing parts.&nbsp;
Mr. Fred Hawkins says he saw at least 2 unmarked graves when he listed the
cemetery in the book Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries in 1987 and he mentions
some notable early Maury County persons whose remains may be there without
markers.&nbsp; Wayne Austin&nbsp; 11/11/2003. Revised 10 Mar 2009.</h1>

<p>Update 10 Mar 2009:</br>
</br>
Dear Mr. Austin</br>
</br>
My name is Lea Ann Scott. I am a long time
resident of the Culleoka community. I am pleased to tell you that the cemetery
has been cleaned up and looking wonderful. Let me say that the cemetery has been
on my mind for the last four years or so. It all started when they put in the
new ball fields across the road. I always wanted the boys baseball team to
restore it for a community project. My son Jacob Scott, his friends Jon Morrow,
and Hunter Morrow decided over a month ago to clean it up. Jacob and Jon are
seniors at Culleoka High School and both needed community service hours for
scholarship applications. They decided that they would clean up the cemetery.
Let me just say that it started out a &quot;project&quot; but ended up being
more than that. We got on-line to research the cemetery and found your name. My
son was so excited and said mom you need to let him know that the cemetery is
clean. These boys do not want any recognition for what they have done. I think
it has showed and taught them to be proud of something!</br>
</br>
I do have to tell you a story about one of the mornings they went to work on the
cemetery. They decided to meet at 10:30 on a Sunday morning and by 10:51 they
were calling to let us know that they had a four-wheeler accident. Boys will be
boys! My son ended up with 33 stitches and Jon ended up with a broken collar
bone. He had to have surgery two days later. That did not stop the boys though,
they were determined to finish what they started. We are so thankful that they
could!!</br>
</br>
Thank you for your
dedication to preserving our heritage. I think our boys will always remember
what they accomplished. They have stories for their children now.</br>
</br>
Respectively,</br>
LeaAnn Scott</br>

Beautiful, Lea Ann.</br>
</br>
I will eagerly await the photos of the restored cemetery. And post them I will.
You may be sure I am willing to hold up their names in honor for their efforts.
What they have just done is a win-win for all. This is a wonderful service to the
community heritage of Culleoka. That little cemetery was totally overgrown and I
dare say it was a tough project.</br>
</br>
I also believe you could send their names to the Columbia Daily Herald. They
have always been a News Paper that supports the community and they enjoy
presenting stories of this nature.</br>
</br>
Thanks again for your efforts to aid these young men in building strong
character and for their work. I wish them well in their future lives</br>
</br>
Wayne Austin
