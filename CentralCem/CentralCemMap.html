</b>In Culleoka go
north on Highway 373 to the Central Church and turn east or right on Scribner's
Mill Road. This is actually midways between Glendale &amp; Culleoka. The
cemetery is located just after you turn into Scribner's Mill Road out in the
field in back of the church. It is about 100 yards from the church and 50 yards
from Scribner's Mill Road. Draw a line that intersects those two points to find
it because the weeds make the small stones hard to find.<a href="../BryantStationCem/BryantStationCemMap.html">
