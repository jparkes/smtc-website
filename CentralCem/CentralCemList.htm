<p align="center"><b>CENTRAL
CEMETERY, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</br>
</b>In Culleoka go north to the Central Church and
turn east or right on Scribner's Mill Road. This is actually midways between
Glendale &amp; Culleoka. The cemetery is just after you turn into Scribner's
Mill Road out in the field in back of the church. It is about 100 yards from the
church and 50 yards from Scribner's Mill Road.<a href="CentralCemMap.htm">

I only saw three carved stones. Only one of them has a pertinent inscription on
it. Of the other two one of them has indications it is cast or cut from stock in
a manufacturing process.&nbsp;</br>

the cemetery. I don't think this cemetery has any affiliation with the Central
Presbyterian Church history. The building is about 100 yards to the west in
front of us.&nbsp;
