Childress Fitzgerald and Simon W. J. Fitzgerald, died of Tuberculosis following
Influenza.)</br>
&nbsp;To: Mary Bob</br>
I know that my Great-Grand mother was supposed to be buried there beside a tree
that is so big now that it would mark her grave. <i>Sherry Young 23 Jan 2009</i>.

Mary Bob/Sherry this cemetery has been so badly abused that there are no stones
standing and there may be some stones lost into the earth. Your information is
consistent with this large Sweet Gum Tree. Graves are all around it with broken
memorials. <i>Wayne Austin 24 Jan 2009</i> </br>
