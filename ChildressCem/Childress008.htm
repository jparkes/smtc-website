The large tree in this photo perhaps hovers over the lost grave of Hardin
Mayberry.<br>
<br>
MAYBERRY, Hardin, born 1856 - death unknown. Husband of Cornelia E. Gallaway,
Thought to be buried here.<br>
Hardin Mayberry was the son of Gabriel and Rosanna (Hardin) Mayberry. He was
born in Hickman County, Tennessee in 1826. He first married Cornelia E., the
daughter of James E. &amp; Marion Galloway. Cornelia died in 1858 and Hardin
then married America Hardin Blair, widow of G. H. Blair and daughter of Pleasant
G. &amp; Tabitha Hardin. Mr. Mayberry served for a time as a soldier in the
Confederate States Army. Several of his children and grandchildren are also
buried in this small cemetery.<br>
A big oak tree has grown up beside the grave of Cornelia, wife of Hardin
Mayberry, and may be over the resting place of Hardin Mayberry. We can find no
stone for Hardin, but concede it may be possible that it is inside the trunk of
the large tree and will be revealed someday when the tree dies and rots
away.&nbsp;<i><br>
