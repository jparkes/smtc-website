<br>
</b>Notes:<br>
</font>This cemetery must be
revisited with a more serious effort to uncover the stones that are lying on the
ground with the inscription facing&nbsp; downward.&nbsp; There are stones all
over and I looked under some of them but it was not possible given the time and tools
I had to turn over all of these stones.&nbsp;<br>
I was unable to find the Mary Gallaway Childress, James Elisha Gallaway nor the
S. W. Gentry memorials that were listed by Mr. Fred Hawkins in 1988 and/or the authors of They Passed
This Way in 1967. It is my opinion that the livestock that roam freely thru here
caused the falling of some memorials that had the inscription available for
review at that time.<br>
