From Bryant's Station, take the Luke Moser Road going north. Go 1.5 miles to
what was in 1988 the Harold Crabtree farm, today it belongs to Nona Fox. The
cemetery is on the right located under a group of large trees in a pasture to
south of the house out from the northward bend in the Luke Moser
road.<font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
