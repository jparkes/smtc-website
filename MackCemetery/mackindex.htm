Wife of John Mack. (Top of tomb almost unreadable. This is possibly the wife of
a son of the first John Mack, There is a fieldstone marking a grave beside this
tomb, per Mr. Fred H.) Patti Heath writes: Polly Mack is the Wife of John A.
Mack Jr. not Sr. Her maiden name was Polly GARNER and she married John Mack Jr.
on 3 February 1799.&nbsp; The others are listed in my Family book as well. So
yes they are all Macks and related to me. I hope that helps. (NO PHOTO)</font><br>
