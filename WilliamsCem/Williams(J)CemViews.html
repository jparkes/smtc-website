This photo spans the cemetery from left to right with the stones facing east and
the rows of graves spanning north/south.</br>

Zooming in a bit brings up the monuments closer so that we can identify them by
color and shape. Location in the graveyard is important to determining family
relationships. On our left is the original monuments to Williams progenitors
Joshua &amp; Sarah, while their offspring and allied families are interred up
and down the rows also in proximity to one another. Husband &amp; wives cluster
together. Children are clustered either together or near their parents.
Daughters that died young mostly due to the difficulties of childbirth are
usually buried out by themselves for future growth of their families unless they
were too young for a family.&nbsp;</br>

By looking northeast we see most all of the monuments in the Williams Cemetery.
In our near bottom view is the broken monument of Joshua H. Williams. Just over
from his monument is his wife's tall memorial Sarah Williams. Over in the far
right center is the big monument of Sarah Margaret Williams Jones. One can identify
the shape and color of these monuments and tell as you tour the individual
stones where they are located in this cemetery to help figure out relationships.
Far out on the end is the box tomb of Harriet C. Williams. The big gray monument
in the top of the photo is for Joshua Lafayette, Sr. and the two tall monuments
nearer to us are for Gen. Wm D. William &amp; wife Sarah G..&nbsp;</br>
