Second stone coming this way from the gray granite Monument

Now all you smart people might be saying there are nearly 30 stones in our view
here. Why do we display only about 20 inscriptions. Answer. Many of the small
stones are footstones positioned so the grave is between the head and footstone.
The footstone is almost always east of the headstone, and smaller, and in most
cases mini versions of the headstone, usually with only the initials on them.
Practice picking them out here for better analysis of the burial places of your
kin in graveyard.</br>
