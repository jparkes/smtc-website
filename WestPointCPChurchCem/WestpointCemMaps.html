From Columbia go north on Theta Pike about 5 miles. The cemetery is on the left behind
and to the left side of the church building which is on one of the highest hills
in the county. As we can see on the above topographical
map it is on one of the highest hills in the county about elevation 950.<br/>

From this aerial view from MS Bing mapping
it is nestled in the clearing of a forest.<br/>

This closer up view shows the circular road and the cemetery to the south of the
church building. That white line runing across the road is a security gate which
can be locked for security reasons.<br/>
