CEMETERY,&nbsp;SMYRNA CHURCH RD., MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

<b>This map shows the coordinates of the Watson-Pinkston Cemetery as 35.5044(N) 
X 86.8967(W). All national mapping has the coordinates so even Findagrave.com 
probably has it wrong. If you visit this cemetery you will need this mapping 
otherwise you will cannot find it short of help. I might add that help and 
permission go hand in hand. </br>

</font><b>From Scribner's Mill go east on 
Scribner's Mill Road and before one
crosses I-65 turn left (north) onto Smyrna Church Road and go about a half mile
north. Round the curve toward the left &amp; stop at the house (now 4/17/2008 owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. William
Warf) on the left and park near the barn. Follow a fence row straight (south)
back from the barn 100 yards and then turn slightly southeast for another 300
yards climbing straight up the steep incline. As you near the peak you will notice the
cemetery ahead of you at the peak of the hill. From there you can look down on your
left (wintertime) at Interstate 65 &amp; and can also hear the car noise thru the
trees. The cemetery is in an old partly fallen barbed wire fenced area. &nbsp;</font></b><b></br>

Notice in the above Aerial View from Mapquest that the cemetery is under the 
trees. Except for the possibility of damaging someone fence by climbing on them 
this cemetery is much closer by just stopping by on Smyrna Church Road. 
Instructions for that if you can get permission is go 200 yards past the little 
pond on the left of Smyrna Church Road (shown on this map) and stop the car and 
climb up the hill going due west and the cemetery will be at the top in the 
trees. This cemetery is under a dense growth of Cedar trees.</br>
