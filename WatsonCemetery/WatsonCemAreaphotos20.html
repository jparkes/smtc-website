<b>This is the first view of the cemetery when you
reach the hilltop. Looking south across a rusty fence. The first fieldstone is
in view here in the center as a dark stand up object, but is not our focus here.</br>

Very difficult to see
the stones in this dark environment especially because they are scattered
around.</br>

As you go into the cemetery this brushy view continues to show.</br>

And still looking across the fence a bit toward the southwest looking for
memorial stones.</br>

This view looks back north from inside the cemetery. The marked memorials are
off to our left and are clustered together. This cemetery area is quite large
with many unmarked graves. There could be hundreds buried here. That cannot be
determined without a detail comprehensive survey and cleaning.</br>
