This cemetery is located off of Old Sowell Mill Pike.<br/>
</b><b>Go east on
Sowell Mill Pike. About two miles beyond the 1-65 overpass keep left on the old
Pike. Where road forks, take another left on dirt road. The cemetery is about a
mile and one half further on, overlooking the bottom lands of Jackson Bend. This
cemetery is very hard to find. The people in the last house on the road into the
area (the Terry Parrish family, in 1987) could have given instructions. We are
uncertain if that knowledge resource still exist today in 2009.<br/>
