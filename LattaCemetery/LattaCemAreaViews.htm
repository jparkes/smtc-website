CEMETERY (Snow Creek Road) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

This is the view you will get of the Latta Cemetery from Snow Creek Road. There
is no access here, because of lack of permission, the high bank, a tall hog
fence &amp; an electric fence.&nbsp;There are three memorials visible here but
we see more stones because each memorial has a footstone. Even several tall
fieldstones are visible from here.<br>

<br>
</font><font size="2">In addition to the tall memorial stone for Samuel Latta
seen on our right (and its footstone) we see here several fieldstones standing on end
marking the head and or foot of graves. The brown patches are the dung of
livestock who also inhabit this space. Two more stones are visible to our right
and many more fieldstones. The use
of formal inscribed stone did not come into widespread use until about 1815.
However, one cannot arbitrarily conclude that these fieldstone were for deaths
before 1815 as the lack of inscribed stones continued to be a tradition in some
circles.<i><br>

</i>This photo is looking at the two remaining headstones south of the above
ones. They are for a mother and
her daughter by the surname Neely. The footstone for the far stone is still
standing. </font></b><font size="2"><b>The near memorial footstone is leaning
against the large tree trunk on our left out of view. A pointed fieldstone
leaning to our left is also faintly seen just behind the far tree trunk in this
photo. It marks the grave of an unknown interment.<br>

This view from further down the hill looks back up northeastward at the cemetery from
an angle which shows the three tall memorials standing. From here we see both
the Latta &amp; two Neely memorials. The massive trees have benefited
by the softer soils which were disturbed when burials took place here nearly two
hundred years ago.<br>

This is a clear view of the three standing memorials here along with the
footstone leaning against the tree. The tree closest to us is a Sugar Maple and
is probably about 100 years old and behind that is a large Red Oak which may be
a couple of hundred years old and could have been around when this graveyard was
active. Notice the old barn in the background as a way to help locate this
graveyard.<br>
