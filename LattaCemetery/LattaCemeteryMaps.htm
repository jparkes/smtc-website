CEMETERY (Snow Creek Road) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#000080">The red check shows
the location of the Latta Cemetery. It is incorrectly labeled above as the Woody
Cemetery. This is a major error and goes back to the 1950s mapping. The GPS Lat
&amp; Long is correct as shown above, so this is just a name issue. The Woody cemetery is
northeast of this place
another mile up Snow Creek Rd.<i><br>

Cemetery, also incorrectly labeled here as the Woody Cemetery.
The cemetery is shown with the square around it.<br>

&nbsp;Access
from the road up the bank is dangerous &amp; steep. There are two fences above
the bank between you and the cemetery. One is a tall hog fence and the other is
electric.<i><br>

</i>
Directions today: From Santa Fe Pike (New Hwy 7) going northwest turn left onto
Snow Creek Road and go 4 tenths of a mile and look right upon the bank of the
road behind a barn at the three standing memorials there. You will then need to go
back to the 1st house east of there on the north side for permission.<i><br>
