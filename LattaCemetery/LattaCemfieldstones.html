In addition to the tall memorial stone for Samuel Latta
seen on our right (and its footstone) we see here several fieldstones standing on end
marking the head and or foot of graves. Two more inscribed stones are on our right
and many more fieldstones. The use
of formal inscribed stones did not come into widespread use until about 1815.
However, one cannot arbitrarily conclude that these fieldstone were for deaths
before 1815 as the lack of inscribed stones continued to be active in some
circles.<i><br/>

</i>In this photo we are looking at least one fieldstone buried half into the ground
marking a grave. If a fieldstone falls from that standing position it is always
suspect as to its original purpose.</b><b><br/>

This massive Maple Tree trunk has grown up around a fieldstone marking a grave,
but really over the grave. The fieldstone is standing on its side buried half
into the soil facing east/west and in the row of the Latta/Neely graves.<br/>

Two fieldstone marked graves are at the foot of this giant Red Oak Tree. The
tree growth might have
dislodged one of them if this was a head and footstone over one grave. It is
clearly beside the grave of Samuel Latta but has some space there.<br/>

In the center may be a stone marking a grave. It has been trampled on for so long
by cattle that one cannot be sure it faces east or is standing.Â <br/>
