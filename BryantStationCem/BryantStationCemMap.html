</font>In Bryant Station
find the cemetery on the west side of what was once the old church, now
converted into a residence. On the old Columbia - Lewisburg Highway. Specific to
I-65. Take Exit 37 and go east toward Lewisburg on Highway 50. Turn north on
Luke Moser Road and when it terminates into the old Lewisburg road turn right
and you are in Bryant Station. Go a few hundred yards and the cemetery is on
your right. The old home place (privacy please) is on the right of the cemetery
back off the road and the old Church (converted into a private house) is just
past the cemetery.</br>
The double solid lines above is Interstate 65. The cemetery is marked above with
a red cross. It is highly probable that the church was moved off the cemetery
property. The residence that appears to be the church is now on the east side of
the cemetery.</font><i><span style="color: navy"></br>
