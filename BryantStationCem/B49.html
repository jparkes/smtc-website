</font></b>ELEANOR - <i>wife of</i><b>
ROBT. F. DENHAM, DIED</b>
</font><i>Oct 20, 1862.<b></br>
</font></b></i><b>DENHAM, Eleanor, died 20 Nov 1862, &quot;Wife, Robert F. Denham.&quot; (Nee: 
Eleanor Watts; married Robert F. Denham 5 Dec 1809, he died 1 Jul 1847 and is 
probably buried in an unmarked or destroyed marker next to Eleanors'. His marker 
might even be one of the two box tombs that sit on either side of the tombstone 
of Eleanor or perhaps the two box tombs with lost inscriptions are for Eleanor 
and Robert F. Denham and Eleanor's tall inscribed marker shown here was set in 
the middle later and does not sit at the head of her grave.
Running counter to my theory is this stone has a footmarker indicating there is 
a grave here between the head and footstone. CWA. </br>
</font>According to 1860 Census of Maury Co. Eleanor is 
living with her married daughter Mary Howard and is listed as 69 years old. 
Further Ron Bruce said Eleanor was born in Georgia in 1791.
