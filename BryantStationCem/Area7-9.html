west from near the east side of the cemetery at the Coffee and Moser memorials.
The three stones fronting us from left is John A Coffey on the left and his
second wife Mary W Gresham, his son Earl by his first wife Nancy S. and then his
first wife's Nancy S.'s memorial. The memorials for Nancy S &amp; Earl are quite
a bit older since they died in the mid 1800s    <br/>
