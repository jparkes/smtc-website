 It is thought
that William &amp; Keziah Richardson, parents of James M., are interred here
along with Lucy Richardson,&nbsp; wife of
James M. Richardson.&nbsp;<i><br>
<br>
</i>Mr. Fred Hawkins comments in 1987: This small family graveyard was once enclosed in a rock wall but
the rock wall is
now completely removed. Only two memorials are now standing and a few others are
lying flat or have been pushed out of the way. Mrs. Scott said that she had been
told that a part of the area had been bulldozed a few years ago. [F.L.H., 1987]<i><br>
<br>
</i>Commentary by Wayne Austin 20 Feb 2010. This old cemetery has been extremely
abused. Many of the stones are missing and others lye flat on the ground
decaying from underground moisture buildup which expands and contracts the
stones and breaks them down. For old soft limestone memorials to survive they
must be kept as dry as possible and kept off of the ground so they can dry
quickly from the ensuing rains and shed the water from their surface. There has
been no effort for that&nbsp; to happen here, so most are now extremely decayed
and unreadable. There are even major declines in the condition of this cemetery
since 1987 when Mr. Fred Hawkins was here. I don't think in recent times anyone
is&nbsp; guilty of anything except neglect &amp; not being aware of how natural
decaying processes can be at least delayed through proper upkeep of these tombs.
Also these tombstone could have been preserved by applying over their surface an
appropriate&nbsp; mixture of mortar, hydrated lime &amp; sand. That hardens the
surface &amp; makes them more resistant to and allows proper absorption of
moisture. Do not use water repellents or other means of sealing the surface of
tombstones. [WA 20 Feb 2010.]<br>

My great great grandfather Elisha Pullen was married first to Anna Richardson.
The Pullens are buried at New Ramie cemetery about 500 yards northeast of this
cemetery. It has come to my attention that this cemetery exist a

 on the north side of Valley Creek road.&nbsp; My best guess is that it is
the William Richardson family who founded the Richardson cemetery. William Richardson
built his home near here about 1812. I believe he passed away sometime
around 1826 and his eldest son James Richardson inherited the land from his
mother Keziah. I think James passed away about 1848 and the house and land was
purchased by Shadrach Dugger who chose to be buried in the New Ramah Cemetery. I have pictures of this old home published in the
Columbia Herald dated 1975. I believe the home burned down in the 1980s. I should add that I don't know a great deal about the William Richardson
line because they are not in my direct line. He was an uncle of Anna Richardson
Pullen and came to Maury County from Wilkes Co., GA. He may have been a
Revolutionary veteran, but I'm not sure about that at this time. Thank you for
all your good work. It's very much appreciated and valued. <i>Pat Cribbet,
