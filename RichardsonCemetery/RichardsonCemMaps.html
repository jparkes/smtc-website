</b>This
topographical map from Topozone is not correct. I have drawn a blue arrow
pointing to the actual place this cemetery can be found. The corrected
coordinates of this cemetery are 35.4542N X 87.0355W. Actually the North
Coordinate may be correct as stated using (NAD 27 calculating methods)Â 
<br/>Directions: Go south on Pulaski Pike to Valley Creek Rd.
Turn east and stop at second house on left. That is before the road goes down a
slope and crosses the small creek. The cemetery is in the back
yard of this house, which is owned by Mr. Scott.<i>

This aerial view shows a yellow pointer indicating the cemetery location under
the trees behind the house. Driveway is on the east
side of the house and permission is required to visit here.<br/>
