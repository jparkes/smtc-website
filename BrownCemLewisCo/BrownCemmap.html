</b>From Isom, go
west on Cathey's Creek Road to the Lewis County line. Continue for one mile to the
site of the old Bethel Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which no longer stands.
Turn right &amp; go 1/4 mile to the cemetery, which can be seen from road. The
cemetery is marked by a red cross on the above map. Isom is not shown, but is
located further into Maury County to your right. Cathey's Creek Road  follows along Cathey's Creek and traverses the Valley with Hills on both sides
of you.<b><br/>
