  Ferdinand Zollicoffer was born about 1818 in Maury County, Tennessee, the
  second of eight children born to George Bancroft Zollicoffer and Abigail C.
  Nicholson. In about 1837, his father moved the family to <st1:place>
  <st1:City>
  Lafayette County</st1:City>
  , <st1:State>
  Mississippi</st1:State>
  </st1:place>
  , where George died in 1843. Abigail remained in <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Lafayette</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  County</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  for a few years after the death of her husband. In 1850, census records show
  her still in <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Lafayette</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  County</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  , but by 1860 the census shows her in Ellis County, Texas. Census records have
  not yielded any information about William. He does not even appear on the 1850
  census for <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Lafayette</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  County</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  . However, in the book &quot;Early Settlers of Lafayette County,
  Mississippi&quot; it states that he was a landowner in <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Lafayette</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  County</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  in 1850. He owned 580 acres of land valued at $4,000 with personal property
  valued at $1, 670. He harvested 1,000 bushels of corn and 33 bales of cotton
  in 1850. Census records for Ellis County and surrounding counties show that
  many of the children and grandchildren George Bancroft Zollicoffer and Abigail
  Nicholson moved on to Texas. After the record of 1850 listed above, I have not
  discovered any other info on William in <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Lafayette</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  County</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  or Ellis County, Texas. It is my belief that he did follow the family there or
  he may have gone first. The last record we have of him is in the book <u>The
  Zollie Tree</u> which states he died in 1861, but does not give location. Most
  researchers agree with me that he most likely died in <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Ellis</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  County</st1:PlaceName>
  </st1:place>
  and is buried there.</font></p>
