	<pre align="center"><b>John Johnstone Stockard was born in 1818 at Mt. Pleasant, Tn. In 1836 at 18 years of age, after his mother's death, he went to Picken Co. Ala., where he was a court clerk at Carrolton and then was in business and banking
there and at nearby Macon, West Point and Columbus Miss., until his death in 1905. In 1849 he married Victoria A. Rupert of Macon, and they had eight children, six sons and two daughters, but I know about only the 
following 5: Dr. Richard Rupert, about 1849 - 1930, Bennet Arthur, who died of tuberculosis in Los Angeles Calif, in Dec., 1919, and left three daughters; Dr. Charles Cecil; Thomas Walter, and Daisy, the youngest.

Mary Bob I found a John Johnson Stockard on Findagrave.com who died in Atlanta GA, buried in Clay County Mississippi, and born in Mt Pleasant Tn. You are kin to the Mt Pleasant Stockards aren't you? 
I have a Susan L. Warden in my charts that was born in Maury County and married a John J. Stockard. She and John disappears off of my charts before they are buried or show a death location. 
MB can you tell me anything about this John J. Stockard shown in Clay County Mississippi on Findagrave.com (findagrave link above). He is interred beside a wife who is Victoria Rubert and she was born in Georgia.

I have Susan L. Warden as born about 1848 too late to be married to this John J. Stockard. [C. Wayne Austin 14 Aug 2011.]</b></pre>
