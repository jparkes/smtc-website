b. July 4th 1944, Columbia Tn - died&nbsp; of cancer September 20, 2015 Isle au 
Haut, Maine.</br>
&nbsp;<u></br>
His Life story</u></b></p>
<p><b></br>
Albert was born in Columbia, Tenn., on the 4th of July, 1944, to Dave Gordon and 
Helen Rose Roth. Helen died when Albert was 4 months old, and Dave was remarried 
to Rose Allen in 1955. </b></p>
<p><b>Albert graduated from Andover class of �62, Yale class of �66, and Harvard 
Law School class of �69. But during his law school years, he realized that he 
was not cut out for the comfortable upper-middle class life for which he had 
been prepared. He broke from his father�s purse strings and supported himself 
through the end of law school by going into business as a light show artist. He 
did psychedelic light shows at the Boston Tea Party and other venues around 
Boston and New England for the big rock, soul and blues acts of the era: Janis 
Joplin, Sam and Dave, B.B. King, the Byrds, the Velvet Underground, Chuck Berry, 
Bo Diddley, Cream, the Grateful Dead and many more. His participation in the 
anti-war movement, his adoption of the emerging values of the hippie culture, 
and his profound experiences with psychedelic drugs impelled him to seize a 
radical freedom to determine the course of his own life, free of the 
expectations of his family and his past. </b></p>
<p><b>After graduating law school, Albert never looked back. He gave away all 
his possessions and took off hitchhiking with his backpack and his dog, moving 
around the country as the spirit and circumstances moved him. This nomadic 
existence lasted for about three years; for the first year he refused to touch 
money. He worked for a living, but would only accept payment in food or shelter. 
He also spent about a year without speaking, reflecting a distrust of words 
stemming from learning how to manipulate the truth in law school. </b></p>
<p><b>The hitchhiking odyssey wound down when Albert and some friends co-founded 
a hippie commune called Skyfields in northern Virginia. The commune broke apart 
in the mid seventies, and in 1975 Albert washed up as an itinerant hippie on 
Isle au Haut. He made many new friends on the island, playing music, doing 
carpentry, and fishing for lobsters. He built an addition onto the house of 
islanders Billy and Bernie Barter, and while working for them, he learned of a 
man with a lot of land and a dilapidated house. He proposed a swap of his labor 
renovating the house for a piece of wild land on the east side of the island. 
That land, where he built his own house, became his home for the rest of his 
life. </b></p>
<p><b>Albert earned his living building houses and boats on Isle au Haut. He had 
a lobster license and fished every summer, first out of a canoe and then from an 
outboard. He was the secretary of the Isle au Haut Lobstermen�s Association for 
many years. He helped to found the Isle au Haut Community Development 
Corporation and in the early �90s designed and built the first three of their 
affordable year-round rental houses. As the chair the Isle au Haut Planning 
Board, he was passionate about conserving Long Pond, Isle au Haut�s pristine 
lake. A fine guitarist and singer, he played in local bands and enjoyed 
countless musical evenings with friends. His encyclopedic knowledge of old rock 
and roll always kept the music rolling. His sense of humor was legendary. </b>
</p>
<p><b>Albert loved his work and was unendingly generous with his time, his 
tools, and his friendship. His partner, Kathie Fiveash, an old friend since law 
school days, joined him on Isle au Haut in 1999 where she taught Music and 
Ecology at the Isle au Haut School for eight winters. For the last eight years 
of Albert�s life, they spent their winters in Northampton, Mass., and he became 
a beloved grandparent to two grandsons and a devoted member of a large extended 
family. As he said on November 2, 2014, to the doctor in the Emergency Room who 
informed him of his cancer diagnosis, &quot;Well, I�ve had a good run, seventy good 
years.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Albert is survived by his partner Kathie, his sister Gail Gilbert, his 
stepbrother Phillip Allen, his nieces Julie Cohen, Betsy Anderson, and Catherine 
Allen, his nephews Michael Gilbert, Michael Gordon, and Jamie Allen, and scores 
of others who loved him. </b></p>

<b>I'm (Jim Dedman)&nbsp; passing this along 
because it is part of Maury County history. While Gordon's dress shop is gone, 
the logo remains on the sidewalk in front of the store on West Seventh Street 
(across from the old Wooldridge Building).</br>
</br>
Al Gordon was one of my longest friends. We reconnected about thirteen years ago 
when I discovered him living on the Isle Au Haute in Maine. We corresponded via 
email and phone up until the week he died. The Gordons are long gone from 
Columbia, but many remember the Dress Shop on the corner. </br>
Al left Columbia Central High School aong with Bob Klahn in 1960 to attend 
Andover and prep for the Ivy League. </br>
