<p align="center">By MARVIN WEST/Guest Columnist of
Knoxville Tn Sentinel.</p>
<p>As bad news goes, this really hurts. The clock is
supposedly running short on one of my favorite Tennessee football captains. Good
doctor says cancer has put a mean hit on Hal Wantland. Hard lick. At age 63.</p>
<p>I never expected Hal Wantland to live forever, but if
toughness was enough, he had a chance. He's top 10 among the rugged men who have
ever put an orange jersey over his shoulder pads. Jacobs Blocking Trophy winner
in '65 for Doug Dickey's first good team. Natural born leader, by example. Quiet
type, heart of a lion, dependability instead of flash, dignity but no hot
quotes.</p>
<p>Wantland's teammates say Hal has not surrendered to
this affliction. Of course not. They haven't either. If they are praying for a
miracle, so be it. They'd be grateful if Tennessee fans who believe in God would
lend a helping hand and add Hal's name to prayer lists.</p>
<p>"We need help," said Mike Price, freshman
wideout when Wantland was a senior, never quite as fast as Richmond Flowers but
a key communications link through the years for the Tennessee football family.</p>
<p>Price is vividly descriptive about the dilemma.
"Medically, we're out of bullets."</p>
<p>Wantland got the negative diagnosis just a few weeks
ago. He was told he wasn't strong enough to endure high-powered treatment. Old
Vols were stunned but, as their custom, they didn't panic and they certainly
didn't give up.</p>
<p>They had a pep rally. Jerry Holloway, Johnny Mills, Ron
Jarvis and maybe a dozen others hurried to help.</p>
<p>They were raising eyebrows when Charley Coffey, former
guard, former assistant coach, former athletics board member, took the lead in a
prayer circle. There is power in faith.</p>
<p>"You want to talk about support? It came from
everywhere," said Price.</p>
<p>Bill Battle, Coffey, Dickey and others of affluence
were ready to fly Wantland anywhere in the country for treatment. There were
private planes on standby. Cost was no object. What could be done.</p>
<p>Not much. With the help of former teammates, Wantland
made it home from the hospital to be surrounded with love and encouragement and
milk shakes loaded with vitamins and minerals. Vital numbers improved.</p>
<p>Hal regain strength. The doctor, surprised by the
progress, knows enough to be guarded in his optimism.</p>
<p>The Wantland wing of the Tennessee football family sees
it differently. That brotherhood thinks a chance is enough. Old Vols know some
things that don't appear on medical charts.</p>
<p>Howell Smith Wantland, born July 9, 1944 in Columbia,
came to Knoxville when it wasn't fashionable, near the end of the Bowden Wyatt
era.</p>
<p>He was a sophomore tailback (single-wing offense).
Behind Mallon Fairclotch during Jim McDonald's interim season as coach, Hal
threw two touchdown passes at Kentucky in 1963 (the day after the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Wantland was a survivor of Dickey's infamous first
winter workout under Section X at Neyland Stadium. He recalled climbing that
blasted peg board, a stick in each hand that fit holes, drilled into each side
of the big board, five holes up and five holes down.</p>
<p>Tough workout. He has never forgotten how bad is
smelled inside the dungeon.</p>
<p>That football season, Hal tried to be whatever Dickey
needed - quarterback, running back, wingback. I was in Baton Rouge for the
halfback pass to Stan Mitchell that looked exactly like a touchdown.</p>
<p>Officials rubbed it out, ruling the passer was a step
pass the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>Wantland was a giant in '65. He was captain in the
truest sense. He set the pace in spring practice. He led those who would follow,
pulled those who were too tired to continue, lifted some who thought they
couldn't get up. He was whatever he needed to be, an inspiration, your best
friend or the Gibbs Hall police officer.</p>
<p>Wantland won two pages in Sports Illustrated when his
dive over the line against Alabama in Birmingham on the third Saturday in
October, the day Snake Stabler spiked the football on fourth down.</p>
<p>Wantland stood tall the next week when three Tennessee
coaches died in the train-car crash. Wantland caught two touchdown passes from
Dewey Warren in the Bluebonnet victory over UCLA. Wantland played in the
Blue-Gray game and the Coaches All-America game and was drafted as an
afterthought by the Washington Redskins.</p>
<p>He played a few pro minutes with the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>"He helped me get my first job," said Mike
Price.</p>
<p>Wantland has never lost touch with the University of
Tennessee.</p>
<p>He was a leader in the rejuvenation of the Letterman's
Club. He was on the committee that planned the Wall of Fame. He was back on the
Shields Watkins Field to receive some richly deserved honor on the Saturday old
Vols allowed me to their fraternity - as an honorary letterman.</p>
<p>Hal Wantland is near enough to a perfect fit of what a
Tennessee football player should be - an honorable man among men, a fierce
competitor, brave to a fault, willing to give more than he gets.</p>
<p>If he had been as swift as Mike Price, Hal might have
been all-world.</p>
