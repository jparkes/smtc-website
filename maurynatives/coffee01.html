COFFEE, Priscilla Howard, 1826 - 17 Aug 1899, wife of
William F. Coffee, daughter of Willoughby &amp; Frances Cochran Howard. He was a Confederate
Officer and was murdered in August of 1864
during the Civil War. It is believed Priscilla transferred to Collin County
Texas between 1876 and 1880. Her home (at least) shows up on the 1876 D. G.
Beers Map of Mt Pleasant, Maury County Tennessee and again during the 1880
federal census of Collin County Texas. She died in Collin Co Texas. She and
William F. Coffee had a family of several children before he was gunned down
toward the end of the Civil War by Major Howell and Sam Morrow two self styled
Federals. Howell was tried and acquitted but removed to Western Kentucky where
he lived out his life. Morrow was later murdered, it is believed, by forces
aligning themselves with Coffee. W. F. Coffee was a member of the Masons a close
knit group who would have stood behind him in the lawless environment after the
war that pitted neighbor against neighbor.  <br/>
Priscilla is interred in the IOOF, Farmersville Cemetery, Collin Co., Texas. Her
husband William F. Coffee is interred in the Howard Cemetery, Mt Pleasant Maury
County Tennessee.<br/>
