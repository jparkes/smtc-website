<pre align="center"><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Above is a picture of my grandmother Susan Leah Tombs. I was informed that the picture was damaged 
in a fire, but the image is still pretty good. Information on the back says the photo was taken back in 1935, 
before she moved to Louisville, Ky. On the back it also provided me with this information. DOB 5/26/1869, 
DOD 9/5/1951 Father: Samuel B. Tombs, Mother: Martha Francis Kilpatrick. I understand that they 
lived in Giles Co, Tn., also and were buried there in the same cemetery as my grandparents.
