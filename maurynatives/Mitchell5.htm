Obituary - Bethany Echo (news),
Moultrie Co., IL.,
14 April 1899.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800000"><b><br>
Mr. Mitchell was born in Murray (Maury) Co., Tennessee, December 5, 1820, and
moved with his father to Illinois in November 1832. He was married to Miss Polly
Walker September 28, 1848, and they lived a peaceful and prosperous life
together for more than fifty years. For more than forty years they have occupied
the residence in which he died.<br>
Mrs. Mitchell and several children and grandchildren live to mourn the loss of
the husband and father who was more than seventy-nine years of age. He was
converted when thirteen years old and has been a member of the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church at Bethany for many years.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800000"><b>The death of this aged and highly respected citizen thins by one the ranks of
the few remaining first settlers of this county. May his ashes rest in peace.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800000"><b>John B. Mitchell died at his home near Bethany Tuesday morning at 11 O'clock,
after an illness of several months during which he was a patient sufferer.
Although his death was expected the news came as a shock and is deeply regretted
by all. He was of an honest unassuming disposition, straight-forward in all his
business dealings and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his fellow men as a
true friend. He leaves a good name and reputation worthy of emulation. When in
health he always attended church services. Mr. Mitchell will be missed as one of
our citizens, but where the loss will be most keenly felt is in the home by his
loved ones where he shall never again occupy his favorite chair by the fireside
or take his place at the head of the table.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#800000"><b>The funeral took place at the Cumberland Presbyterian Church Wednesday
afternoon at 3 O'clock. The sermon was preached by Rev. T. B. McAmis after which
the body was tenderly laid to rest in the new cemetery.</b></font></p>
