<strong><u>GENERAL GIDEON JOHNSON 
PILLOW<br/>
</u><br/>
Gideon Pillow, who was born on 8 Jun 1806, was reared in that part of Williamson 
County that later became Maury County. Early in life he found that he liked 
politics and, although he never sought election to any office, he was of great 
assistance to his friends, especially to James Knox Polk. Pres. Polk rewarded 
this help by appointing him a Brigadier General in 1846 and he served valiantly 
as Major General during the Mexican War. He became a General in the Confederate 
Army in 1861 and, although his reputation was tarnished somewhat when Ft. 
Donaldson fell, he continued to make his contribution, as officer and 
philanthropist. He spent most of his resources (more than $300,000.00) and lost 
four cotton gins, 409 slaves, 500 cows, 2000 hogs, 10,000 lbs. of bacon and 2000 
bales of cotton in the lost cause. He was left a near-pauper. His way of life 
gone, he moved to Memphis, where he practiced law for a number of years. He died 
on 8 Oct 1878 in Helena, Ark. And was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.<br/>
