  Virginia Zollicoffer, affectionately know as Tennie, was born 16 Jun 1841 in
  Maury County, Tennessee, the fifth child of Dr. Frederick Zollicoffer and
  Elizabeth Petillo Love. In about 1849, the family left Maury County with some
  other members of the Love family and moved to Attala County, Mississippi where
  Frederick and family appeared on the 1850 census and slave schedule. Elizabeth
  Love Zollicoffer must have returned to Tennessee for visits from time to time.
  She died in Tennessee in 1854 and was buried in the (J.D.) Love Cemetery in
  Maury County; her body was later removed with that of her parents and moved to
  the Wilkes-Campground Cemetery. When her mother died in 1854, there were
  several children still at home, ranging in age from 16 to under 1 year of age.
  Tennie and her sister, Mary, were the oldest girls and were called upon to be
  surrogate mother’s to their younger sisters. On 1 Aug 1861 in Attala County,
  Mississippi, Tennie united in marriage with James Mills Edwards, who was born
  about 1830 in Tennessee. They were blessed with the birth of four sons: James
  M., Evan, Felix and Jesse Edwards. Tennie became a young widow with four small
  children when James died on 3 Aug 1867. By 1870, census records show us that
  Tennie has moved her family into the home of her father, Frederick. In about
  1880, Tennie married a second time. This time she married chancery clerk,
  Jessie P. Mills. He was a native of Kentucky and the son of John and Elizabeth
  Mills. He was a widower, having been married to Tennie’s sister, Marie
  Amelia “Mary” Zollicoffer. He had one daughter and two sons still at home.
  They joined Tennie’s two boys and formed a family. Jessie and Tennie later
  joined to the family with the birth of their daughter, Mary Mills Johnson.
  Tennie died on 30 Jul 1891 and was buried in the Kosciusko City Cemetery in
  Kosciusko, Attala County, Mississippi. <br>
