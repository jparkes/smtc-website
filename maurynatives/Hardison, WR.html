<DIV>Roy Hardison is my dad's first cousin.&nbsp; He was the son of Wm. Gray and Sallie Bettie (Jones) Hardison.&nbsp; Wm Gray was the brother of my grandmother, Sallie Ann Hardison Sharp.&nbsp; Roy and Neuva were Maury County natives.&nbsp; Roy played music with the Gulley Jumpers on the Grand Ole Opry.&nbsp; I don't know if you'ver ever heard of them.&nbsp; They lived in Nashville and are buried at Woodlawn Cemetery on Thompson Lane in Nashville.&nbsp; My sister, Neuva Lee Sharp Sears, is named after Neuva Hardison.&nbsp; I noticed you have a place for Maury Countians buried other places so I thought you might like to have theirs also.&nbsp; Poppy sent them to you earlier today.&nbsp; Let me know if they came through okay.&nbsp; She also sent the Maxwell one from Jones Cem and the one of Helen Jane Turner Chappell at Polk Mem Gardens.&nbsp; Hope they came through alright.</DIV>

<DIV>I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.</DIV>
