<div>Roy Hardison is my dad's first cousin.  He was the son of Wm. Gray and Sallie Bettie (Jones) Hardison.  Wm Gray was the brother of my grandmother, Sallie Ann Hardison Sharp.  Roy and Neuva were Maury County natives.  Roy played music with the Gulley Jumpers on the Grand Ole Opry.  I don't know if you'ver ever heard of them.  They lived in Nashville and are buried at Woodlawn Cemetery on Thompson Lane in Nashville.  My sister, Neuva Lee Sharp Sears, is named after Neuva Hardison.  I noticed you have a place for Maury Countians buried other places so I thought you might like to have theirs also.  Poppy sent them to you earlier today.  Let me know if they came through okay.  She also sent the Maxwell one from Jones Cem and the one of Helen Jane Turner Chappell at Polk Mem Gardens.  Hope they came through alright.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.</div>
