<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.5pt">1819 - 26 
Jan 1848. (Died in the Spanish American War in Vera Cruz Mexico 26 Jan 1848. 
Buried on battle field in Veracruz Mexico in unmarked grave. He has descendents. 
Van Perryman of Texas is a descendent.)</br>

Shame no more credit is given the guys who won the Mexican American War. Our 
country gained something in this war compared to most others (Land). Texas, 
California, Arizona, &amp; New Mexico. I realize we now live in a time when it's not 
a politically correct war kicking Mexico's behind but I'm a firm believer in 
teaching history the way it happened not what some groups want it to be. Van 
Perryman. <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~maury/c031925.htm">
