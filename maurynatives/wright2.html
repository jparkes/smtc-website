Wright and Cora Dean Kennedy. The family emigrated to Atoka, Oklahoma between 1910 and 1920. 
In Oklahoma, Lorena met and married William Andrew "Bill" Cecil. Lorena gave birth to one son William Andrew
 Cecil Jr. who died shortly after birth. She learned she could not have any more children so they went to the 
local Choctaw Indian reservation and adopted two young Native American boys which they named William Andrew 
Cecil Jr. (in honor of their boy who died) and Joe A. Cecil. Both boys are still alive (2004) today. Lorena died on 18 
Jan 1962 due to complications from diabetes. She was buried in the Wards Chapel Cemetery in Atoka, Oklahoma. 
The daughter of Joe A. Cecil took the photos of the Wright family tombstones and sent them to me. Her name is 
Charlotte Peebles and she lives in California.
