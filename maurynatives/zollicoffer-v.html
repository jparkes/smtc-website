ZOLLICOFFER, Virginia
Pocahontas "Sis": Virginia Pocahontas "Sis" Zollicoffer was
the first born child of Gen. Felix Kirk Zollicoffer and Louisa Pocahontas
Gordon. She was born at the family home in Maury County on 12 Dec 1837. When her
mother died while "Sis" was still young, "Sis" was called up
on to become mother to her small brothers and sisters. On 2 Nov 1858, she became
the wife of James Hazzard Wilson III at the home of her father in Nashville,
Tennessee. They were blessed with the birth of 9 children: Emeline, Maria Ruth,
Virginia Zollicoffer, Felix Kirk Zollicoffer, Leonard Zollicoffer, Mary Felicia,
Robert Evelyn, and Katherine. Not too many years into their marriage, James like
many other Southern men were beckoned to war, leaving "Sis" with the
responsibility of motherhood to her small children and her younger brothers and
sisters. This became more than a responsibility as she became the only parent to
some of them, when their father, Gen. Felix Zollicoffer was killed in battle in
1862. James and Virginia had been given a brand new home by her in-laws as a
wedding present. The home was known at the time as Harpeth but today the name
has been changed to Inglehame. Due to hard times after the war, the family had
to sell the home and move from Brentwood, Tennessee to Nashville. Virginia
"Sis" Wilson died there on 2 Nov 1912 and was buried in the Old
Nashville City Cemetery in Zollicoffer Square. Inscription: WILSON VIRGINIA
ZOLLICOFFER WILSON 1887-1912
