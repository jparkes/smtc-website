From Columbia traveling Hampshire Pike west go about 10 miles and veer right off onto Taylor Store
Road. After a couple of miles turn left on Love Branch Road. Travel Love Branch
Road for about 3/4 mile and turn right on South Point Ridge Road. Follow South
Point Ridge Road for something less than a mile and look left and you will see
the cemetery near the road as you round a slight curve to the left.</b><center><b>Â <br/>

This aerial view from MapQuest is detailed enough to see the stones all lined up
north and south, but facing east/west. This is 3/4 mile down the road from the
Baxter Cemetery on the same side of the road.<i><br/>
