POINT CEMETERY, SOUTH POINT ROAD, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>

</font></b><font color="#000080"><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This is
the sign for the cemetery. This sign might be suggesting the name to be
&quot;The Edwards Cemetery at Southpoint&quot;.<br>
As I was photographing this cemetery a nearby pack of hunting dogs were setting
up a clamor of howling &amp; barking. I felt a like I was on a
Raccoon/Possum/Fox or Rabbit Hunting expedition instead of conducting Cemetery
research here. Being a city dweller for last the 44 of 62 years this was amusing
as it brought back childhood memories.<br>
