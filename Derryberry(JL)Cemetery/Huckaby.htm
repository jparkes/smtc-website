(J.L.) CEMETERY, NEAR I-65, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<Br>
Note: Lula Derryberry was married 1st to John S. Craig who only lived 14 months 
after their marriage. He was a school teacher and probably a victim of Typhoid 
Fever which took the lives of two of his brother-in-laws, William J. &amp; Robert J. 
Derryberry, that same year. John. S. Craig is buried in the Jackson Cemetery at 
Jackson Bend. The Craig baby was born and died a few months after the father 
died. On 15 Apr 1915 Lula Craig married William &quot;Billy&quot; Huckaby. They were the 
parents of the Huckaby twins B. &amp; D. in 1915 who are listed here. <br>
<i>This information comes partly from &quot;Hardison and Allied Families&quot; and was 
verified by Faye Bradford by phone conversation with Carrie Huckaby Bolton, 
daughter of Billy and Lula Huckaby 18 Aug, 2010.</i></b></font></p>
