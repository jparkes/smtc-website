This photo of the Joe Derryberry home was taken 2 Sep 2007 when it was still
barely standing. It is now abolished. This House stood just east of Hwy 99 from Jones Cemetery. Judging from the
chimneys placement and style it may go back as far as the good economic times of
the 1890s if not earlier.<i><b></br>
