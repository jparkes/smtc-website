<p align="center"><b>DERRYBERRY
(J.L.) CEMETERY, NEAR I-65, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
Note: Lula Derryberry was married 1st to John S. Craig who only lived 14 months 
after their marriage. He was a school teacher and probably a victim of Typhoid 
Fever which took the lives of two of his brother-in-laws, William J. &amp; Robert J. 
Derryberry, that same year. John. S. Craig is buried in the Jackson Cemetery at 
Jackson Bend. The Craig baby was born and died a few months after the father 
died. On 15 Apr 1915 Lula Craig married William "Billy" Huckaby. They were the 
parents of the Huckaby twins B. &amp; D. in 1915 who are listed here. <br/>
<i>This information comes partly from "Hardison and Allied Families" and was 
verified by Faye Bradford by phone conversation with Carrie Huckaby Bolton, 
daughter of Billy and Lula Huckaby 18 Aug, 2010.</i></b></p>
