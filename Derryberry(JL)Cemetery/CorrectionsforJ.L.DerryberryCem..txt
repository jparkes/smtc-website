CORRECTIONS FOR       J. L. DERRYBERRY CEMETERY


Add:
CRAIG, Infant of John S.  & Lula Derryberry Craig,  B & D. 1907. Note:  Not sure if grave has a marker. 

DAVIS, Brownie Mae, B. & D. 1911, Infant of John Barkley & Hattie Ora Brown Davis.
DAVIS, Infant of John Barkley & Hattie Ora Brown Davis, B. & D. 1912. 

Note: Markers for the Davis infants were placed by James Harold and Mary Ruth Brown Parrish.  These two markers were not found on last visit to photograph this cemetery.  Will try to locate and uncover these markers  during cold weather when the underbrush is down somewhat.  This information received by Faye Bradford through phone conversation with James Harold Parrish 18 Aug, 2010. 


CHANGE: To read, 
DERRYBERRY, Twins of Billy and Lula Huckaby, B. & D. 1915.  


Note:  Lula Derryberry was married 1st to John S. Craig who only lived 14 months after their marriage.  He was a school teacher and probably a victim of Typhoid Fever  which took the lives of two of his brother-in-laws, William J.  & Robert J. Derryberry,  that same year.  John. S. Craig is buried in the Jackson Cemetery at Jackson Bend. The Craig baby was born and died a few months after the father died.  On 15 Apr 1915 Lula Craig married William "Billy" Huckaby.  They were the parents of the Huckaby twins B. & D. in 1915 who are listed here.  This information comes partly from "Hardison  and Allied Families" and was verified  by Faye Bradford  by phone conversation with Carrie Huckaby Bolton, daughter of Billy and Lula Huckaby 18 Aug, 2010.
