present cemeteries for the purpose of yielding to the visitor history, genealogy

</font></u><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">You will find
in many cases the photographs a bit redundant. Redundancy is offered for the purpose
of allowing the visitor to draw their best conclusion as to which graves are
near other graves of interest. The proximity of the graves are an important
determinant as to the relationship of the individual burials to one another. 
Presenting the interred and determining
relationships is the primary focus here which is of genealogical importance to
the average visitor. Our focus is on the tombstones and not on the graves for
the photography effort. The graves are in a row and the tombstones are usually
in different rows at the head or usually west of the grave. This leaves room for
confusion if one cannot determine where the graves lie in relation to the
tombstones in the photographic effort.<br>

Unmarked Graves</u><br>
</font><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">It is our purpose
to present cemeteries we show of Southern Middle Tennessee and Northwestern
Alabama in a way that yields the best available truth of who may be interred in
these grounds.&nbsp; That may be irrespective of whether there is a headstone
there or not. You will find many photos of fieldstones and sunken grave plots
with no stone presented and we in no way usually have the perfect truth if these
are really graves or not. There are certain evidences of a grave that were
mostly applied, but in some cases our approach was not scientific enough to prove
whether or not the focal point of the photo was actually a grave, or an anomaly
instead of a grave. you will notice in days of old prior researchers looked around and counted
the fieldstones and showed that information. We believe that to be helpful 
information, but usually this is not conclusive as to whether those counts 
represent actual graves without inscribed headstones or not. If we can give you 
enough information to cause you to conclude your ancestor is buried in a certain 
graveyard without a headstone, we would be pleased for you to give back that 
information to this site administrator for adding here whether you add it to findagrave.com or not.<br>
It is our aim to give you enough information on this site in most cases to draw
the same conclusion concerning the number of unmarked graves as this researcher 
was able to make.<br>
<br>
</font></b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><u>My ancestral 
experience dealing with unmarked graves<br>
</u></font><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I must tell 
you I think only about 1/2 or so of the American deaths through out our history 
are reported on the site findagrave site. Someone has to want to add the listing 
and know the cemetery or method of shall we say &quot;place of disposal of the 
remains&quot; for that to happen.<br>
<br>
There are all these folks today that just disappear off the radar screen because 
of cremation etc and other alternative disposal methods. Its kinda like burials 
of 1700-1830 in America mostly in rural areas. They just took their bodies off 
to the back side of the farm on a hillside and dug a hole and place the body in 
it. Years later if the family did not move away and the availability of 
tombstones came on stream they often remembered to place a headstone. If the 
family moved away that was it. Maybe only a fieldstone marked the grave, or 
maybe not if there were no stones around or maybe they marked the grave with a 
stick which quickly rotted.<br>
<br>
As for me and my experience with family grave searches I have identified most of 
my ancestors going back at least 7 generations or more to about a birth date of 
1750 and that is 254 ancestors. For only about 1/2 of those folks am I able to 
place in graveyards with a marked grave stone. The earliest I have found are 
Robert &amp; Rachel Crockett who died in the 1820s, James Kerr who died in 1818, 
Chesley Coffee who died in 1818 &amp; Jacob &amp; Milly Wilhoite died in the 1820s. At 
the time of their death most of these folks were buried on their farms, but 
later in many cases other burials were added to become major community 
graveyards, but in others the grave reverted back to being a part of a farm as 
part of maybe the barn yard, etc. Pitiful how land owners can be so 
disrespectful about this in many cases.<br>
<br>
In searching for the graves of my ancestors if I don't find an inscribed grave 
stone in most cases I cannot tell close enough as to where they lived to set up 
a listing anywhere. I just took a trip 8 Sep 2014 to identify the location of 
Epps Hollow as a place in Lincoln Co. Tennessee where my Epps ancestors who had 
earlier hobnobbed with Thomas Jefferson, but lived in the 1850s in Lincoln Co. 
It was confusing because there are two Epps Hollows in Lincoln County 
topography, but the southern most one was owned by my ancestors near Sulfur 
Springs. Now after some research I know enough to add their approximate burial 
sites since I know their name, birth and death dates from other records. This 
stuff is revolutionary in the science of burial location listing. It is very 
challenging, but it keeps me mentally alert and away from boring television.<br>
