<p align="center"><b>HARDISON (LIGGETT) CEMETERY,&nbsp;Blackburn
Road, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>

1986: Turn north onto Blackburn Road off Bear Creek Pike and go about a mile to old
Liggett Hardison place which is on left of road. Cemetery is on slope of hill
behind house, in a locust (trees) thicket.</br>
2008: The old house no longer stands so the best instructions for finding this
cemetery today is is to turn off of Bear Creek Pike onto Blackburn Road and go
one mile. When the road bends look to your left for a field road that
follows downward a bit. Follow that for 50 yards and stop there and look
straight ahead (northwest) at the upward slope before you. The cemetery is on
the side of that slope enclosed in a chain link fence. A bunch of white fill
debris was dumped on the farm road when I was there and it was not passable.
Luckily the cemetery is only about 300 yards from Blackburn Road. This cemetery will be
hard to see in the summer with the foliage in place.

<p><b>This cemetery should have the name &quot;E. Jonathan Hardison Cemetery&quot;
since he was the first buried here and only his descendents, etc. are buried
here. It is called &quot;Liggett Hardison Cemetery&quot; by residents of the
area, however. [Fred L Hawkins, 1986.]</br>
</br>
Lest you judge these folks as little country people because of the size of their
memorials, think again. They lived in quite nice homes. They worked hard and
were highly respected in the community in which they lived. Today their home and
all evidence of their livelihood is gone, but this cemetery stands as a
testimony to their success in this community. If you noticed someone is still adding flowers to their
memorials after more than 60 years. I pray the rest of us will live our lives in
a manner whereby we will be so loved. [W.A.&nbsp; 20 Feb 2009.]</b></p>
