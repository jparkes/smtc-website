<p align="center">POPULAR
UNION CEMETERY, HIGHWAY 50, HICKMAN COUNTY,
TENNESSEE

</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><b>This
cemetery is located just off Highway 50 on the left traveling west from
Columbia, Maury County, Tennessee. At this writing the sign on the highway has been
taken down.</br>
An overview of the cemetery shows many markers, fieldstones and a block fence
surrounding it. The fence is only two blocks high with several entrances. There
are no trees in this cemetery, but a wire fence on the back has trees and makes
for a shady evening in the cemetery.</br>
(The earliest grave that is marked is that of Margaret P. Anderson, daughter of
William and Margaret Anderson. She was born 1877 and died 1882.)</font></br>

History of Popular Union Cemetery E-mail Update: Fri, 28

</br>
Faye Jackson: Joyce do you know how the name Popular Union Cemetery came
about?&nbsp;</br>
</br>
Joyce Mayberry: I can find no reference as to its name. I do know there was once
a schoolhouse there. And if there was a school house more than likely there was
a church. The name sounds like a Church name. Perhaps a Baptist, but do not
know. I am not aware if the Andersons were Baptist. There may be a deed
somewhere that would tell, but that has to be later research.&nbsp; Sorry I
cannot be of more help, but a good guess would be a Church. In early days,
school buildings were also used as churches, and that is what it sounds like. <i>Joyce
