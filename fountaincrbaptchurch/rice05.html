<b>RICE, Elder Ebenezer,
Mar 1750 - June 1834. My best effort at this weak Inscription: " In Memory
of Elder Ebenezer Rice? Born Mar-ch 1750 or 1756 Died Ju-ne 1834 Aged 83 years
and 3 months" This stone is not on any cemetery records of Maury County as
far as I can tell and the inscription is very weak. Had I known this at the time
of the visit I might have read it closer in person. The dates calculate to 84 years and
3 months, but appear to be 73 years &amp; 3 months. The stone might have been dug up in recent years. <i>Photo &amp; info by
