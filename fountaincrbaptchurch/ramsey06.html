<b>RAMSEY, William, 27 Aug
1739 - 28 Jan 1820. 81 years. Inscription: &quot;Sacred to the memory of Wm
Ramsey born Aug 12th 1739 Died January 20th 1820 Aged 81 years.&nbsp; (J)ES&quot;.
Beautiful workmanship on this memorial for the 1820s. The &quot;JES&quot; is probably the
initials of the stone carver. At the bottom part of the stone the surface is
peeling away. Part of the peeled section is already missing and could not be
located.
