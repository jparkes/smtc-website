&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Looking
west across the cemetery. Time has taken a toll on this old cemetery. At one
time there were many stones. Maybe some of them could be located
below the ground if an effort were made. Some day Ground Penetrating Radar
equipment will be inexpensive enough to be used here for the purpose of analysis
of this cemetery. I think there will be many surprises when this is done. <i>By Wayne Austin 03/24/2004.</br>

This view is looking southwest across the few memorials standing. Many of the
stones have great artistic workmanship.&nbsp; I have altered
these photos to protect the privacy of the neighbors, but no changes have been
made in the cemetery view.</p>
