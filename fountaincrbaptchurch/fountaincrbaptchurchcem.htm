history is the best way to gain a knowledge of the people who rest in this
cemetery. I will however
leave that to the writers of Cemeteries of Maury County Tennessee by Fred
Hawkins. Also Maury County Churches presents a history of the church that at one
time was located on the grounds here. This cemetery is rich in history and culture of early Culleoka and
Pleasant Grove and worthy of reading as found in the above mentioned books.&nbsp;<br>
To find this cemetery go west on the Mooresville Pike until you pass the Frank Moore Rd.
Continue on and look to your left as you start down the road and the cemetery is
almost on the shoulder of the road. There is no place to park your car so you
must park and walk. The immediate neighbors do not wish to share their private parking
space. The Cemetery and Stones are well kept but
have naturally broken &amp; decayed from age and lost much of their readability.
Some have even
disappeared. I was unable to find inscribed stones for Mary Allen, Thomas
Goodrum, Ann Ramsey and the two Richard Tidwells'. These were burials that
previous researchers either found or had records indicating the mentioned persons were
interred here. </span></h1>
