</b>In Groveland, or Hill Station, go east on Groveland Ridge Rd. to a place where
the T.V.A. transmission line crosses the road; turn right on local access road
and go 1/4 mile to cemetery. (It was  on the James Wiley Davidson place in
1986.)<br/>
<b><br/>
While searching for
the Davidson Cemetery I was standing on the Newcut road and I spotted the area
on the map where the cemetery is supposed to be. I had it pegged as on the right
side of the third TVA tower out from the road following the TVA Transmission
lines northeast. I was willing to hike the 3/4 mile it would take from the road
where I was located if the walking was easy. However, standing on Newcut Road
south east of the cemetery I could not see the third TVA Steel tower out from me
since it was on the descending side of a hill. After noting the road circled the
place of interest I drove on eastward trying to determine a better point of
access. When I had traveled about 250 degrees in a full circle or about a mile
further I noted a public sign "Davidson Cemetery" pointing into a road
where the Cemetery was located. It also seemed to be the driveway of a couple of
houses. When I drove about a � mile into the place and passed all the houses I
came to a place to park under the TVA Power Lines and got out and noticed the
cemetery about 500 yards out to the east from me down in a clearing in the
woods. <i><br/>
The road above that appears to go around the Cemetery is called Newcut road on
the Delorme Maps.</i>          <i><span style="color: navy"><br/>
