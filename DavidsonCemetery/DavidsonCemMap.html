<p align="center"><b>DAVIDSON
CEMETERY,&nbsp; MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
use your scroll bars to view the right most areas of the cemetery.</br>

</font></b>In Groveland, or Hill Station, go east on Groveland Ridge Rd. to a place where
the T.V.A. transmission line crosses the road; turn right on local access road
and go 1/4 mile to cemetery. (It was&nbsp; on the James Wiley Davidson place in
1986.)</br>
</font><b></br>
</font>While searching for
the Davidson Cemetery I was standing on the Newcut road and I spotted the area
on the map where the cemetery is supposed to be. I had it pegged as on the right
side of the third TVA tower out from the road following the TVA Transmission
lines northeast. I was willing to hike the 3/4 mile it would take from the road
where I was located if the walking was easy. However, standing on Newcut Road
south east of the cemetery I could not see the third TVA Steel tower out from me
since it was on the descending side of a hill. After noting the road circled the
place of interest I drove on eastward trying to determine a better point of
access. When I had traveled about 250 degrees in a full circle or about a mile
further I noted a public sign &quot;Davidson Cemetery&quot; pointing into a road
where the Cemetery was located. It also seemed to be the driveway of a couple of
houses. When I drove about a ï¿½ mile into the place and passed all the houses I
came to a place to park under the TVA Power Lines and got out and noticed the
cemetery about 500 yards out to the east from me down in a clearing in the
woods.&nbsp;<i></br>
The road above that appears to go around the Cemetery is called Newcut road on
the Delorme Maps.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><i><span style="color: navy"></br>
