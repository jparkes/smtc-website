While searching for the Davidson Cemetery I spotted the area on the map where it
is supposed to be.
I had it pegged as on the right side of the third TVA tower out from the road
following the TVA Transmission lines. I was willing to hike the 3/4 mile it
would take from the road where I was located if the walking was easy. However,
standing south east of the cemetery I could not see the third TVA Steel tower out from me since
it was on the descending side of the hill. After noting the road circled the
place of interest I drove on trying to determine a better point of
access. When I had traveled about 250 degrees in a full circle or about a mile
further I noted a public sign &quot;Davidson Cemetery&quot; pointing into a road
near where the Davidson Cemetery was located. The road also seemed to be the driveway of a
couple of houses. When I drove about a ï¿½ mile into the place and passed all the
houses I came to a place to park under the TVA Power Lines and got out and
noticed the cemetery about 500 yards out from me down in a clearing in the
woods. I strode off to the place with my camera and gear. Just about 50 feet
from the cemetery I heard a voice. Someone said: &quot;Can I help you?&quot; I
turned to stare at a deer hunter with an automatic rifle pointing straight up
into the air. He was perched high up in a tree on a deer stand. I kept my
direction toward the cemetery and mumbled that I was interested in photographing
the Davidson Cemetery. He responded; &quot;Are you kin to the Davidson's?&quot;
No I replied I am a cemetery researcher. He got down from the Deer stand and as
he came toward me I mentioned that I was sorry I messed up his deer hunting. He
replied that it was OK since it was near enough toward the end of the day. There was probably not much chance of getting a
kill anyway. The conversation with the young man turned
casual which uncovered his name as Joe Dugger of Culleoka. I judged him to be
about 20 years old. He had a shock of bushy Blond hair and a stark resemblance
to Bo Duke in the kids TV show &quot;Dukes of Hazard.&quot; He said his family
owns the land around there and watches over the cemetery and had placed the road sign there a couple of years
ago and that they occasionally cleaned up the cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
 After coming into the cemetery and noting several
fallen stones we set about standing them up. Joe talked incessantly as I
photographed the cemetery. We discussed the genealogy and family history of the
area. With a
prevalent surname such as Dugger his ancestors no doubt crossed the path's of mine
many times. I recall many the old conversations my Mom and Dad had in the
1950/1960/1970 era and the Dugger surname was often mentioned. Never did I hear
anything but good memories about them.&nbsp;As this was the last cemetery of the
day we bid adieu and off to Alabama I went. </font>
