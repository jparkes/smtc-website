This wide angle
modification made from 3 photos shows most of the cemetery. There are many stones
that are in need of repair as you can see. Some are broken and on the ground.
Others are fallen from their bases and still there are many displaced footstones
that belong with headstones that may be missing. There are several fieldstones
marking graves including one where the large cedar tree grew up in the center of
a grave. On the far side of the Cedar Tree lies the graves of the McFalls' while
on this side is the large old stone of Joanna Freeland out aways is the tall
stone of Sarah Moser, while next left of her stone is the fallen stone for
Lucelta Page &amp; her sister Perlina Spurinhower. On our lower right is the
fallen stone of Martha Kirk while the standing one is for John Kirk. Further on
out is the newer stones of the Davidson family including the most recent and
prominent memorial for James Wiley &amp; Cynthia Lee Davidson. Also out there
are the Larue family memorials. Below the span of this photo and not captured is
the memorial for Mary V. Cockrill and her child W.N. who have death dates on the
same day.<i><span style="color: navy"><br/>
