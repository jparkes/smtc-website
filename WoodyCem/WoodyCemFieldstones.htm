  This window photo shows how some of the fieldstones are lined up in the
  graveyard. They are mostly in the upper eastern part of the cemetery which
  usually is the oldest part of the graveyard.&nbsp;<br>
  <i><font color="#800080">I will tell a fictitious story here using made up
  names and places end events to illustrate how fieldstones get used instead of formal headstones. We will use the difficult times after the Civil
  War in the south or the year 1875.<br>
  <u>
  The passing of little Liz&quot;<br>
  </u>
  </font>&quot;Today we lost our little precious 10 year old Liz to the
  croup. She fought hard but the awful sickness took over in the end. We layed
  her in Mr. James's best Cedar wooden casket he had hand made. We all
  made the final trip to our family burial ground and placed her into the soil
  in the grave dug by Mr. Dugan and some other church men earlier. She was so peaceful
  with all the dressing up her mother did for her. We will miss our little
  darling. Going to be quite an adjustment for sister Susie especially since they were so close.<br>
  I will find the best stone we can near the creek today. We can
  set it up at the head of her grave and put a smaller stone at her foot. As
  soon as the Tombstone salesman comes to town Johnny, Jim, mother &amp; I will
  go into town and meet
  them and pick out a headstone for her.&nbsp;<br>
  Five years later in 1880 came and hard times were still around. The money
  coming in from farming the cows, hogs and corn is just barely enough to feed
  our family of 12. The tombstone salesman came and went and no one felt they
  were able to meet them this year so it was put off until next year. Next year
  again came and went. Now the fading memories means it is getting easier to
  prolong that need.&nbsp;<br>
  Year 2009 is here now and the little fieldstone is still there. Today it has
  fallen over. No longer is it clear that it is at the head of a grave. The
  movement of livestock and time has scattered the footstone. All have died out
  who had
  knowledge of Little Liz's grave location &amp; name so Little Liz's grave
  location has long
  since become known only to God. Today descendents &amp; gravestone researchers
  alike are taking photos of common rocks and pondering the unknown.&quot;<br>
  <font color="#800080">The above story is fiction and not true except to the
  extent that this scenario or a similar one repeated itself many times over in olden times. The names and places
  are not real in the above story.</font><br>
