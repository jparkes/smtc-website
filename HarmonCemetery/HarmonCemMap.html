We have placed a yellow pointer on the above map to indicate where we can find
this cemetery. On this map the cemetery was still under the trees, but has since 
been cleared. Notice we are east about 3/4 of a mile from I-65. Joe Peay Road runs
parallel with Interstate 65 and spans eastward out toward the cemetery and
community.</br>
