	Mrs Susan Gentry McLean on December 28, 1909 at the home of W.W. McLean, 
	went home to live with the angles and the savior she had followed for so 
	long. Aunt Sue was born Jan 25th, 1824 and was age 84. Her native county was 
	Williamson but her parents moved to Marshall County, near Caney Spring. The 
	old home still remains in the Gentry family and in connection with this home 
	they treasure the sacred memory of their mother and grandmother, Mrs. 
	Virginia Campbell Gentry. Sometime in her mature womanhood aunt Sue was 
	married to W.M. McLean, she came as a joy and benediction to his home. He 
	being a widower with two small children, she filed the place of mother with 
	perfect satisfaction to both father and children. Three more children were 
	added to their family, the late W.W. McLean, Mrs. John Bryant and M.G. 
	McLean of Lewisburg. She was a niece of Merideth P. Gentry of the long ago. 
	She was buried in the Bethlehem Cemetery of the Bethlehem Cumberland 
	Presbyterian Church. Written by Mrs. J.M. McLean.</span></p>
