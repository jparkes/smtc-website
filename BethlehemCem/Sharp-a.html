    Thomas Edward Sharp.<br/>
    The above 
    is an update on the grave of a child buried here some 80 years ago. <br/>
    There was not found anything in our Bethlehem Cemetery records on this burial. We did 
    not even know there was a grave at plot 324. [Photos above now - 13 Nov 
    2010]<br/>
    <br/>
    The brother of this child E-mailed me after finding our listing on the 
    Bethlehem Cemetery site.<br/>
    All the siblings of this child banded contributed to this memorial.<br/>
    Once again your site has proven valuable and has helped in solving a 
    mystery, albeit one we did not even know existed.<br/>
    I am sure there are a other such instances waiting to be discovered. A lot 
    can happen since 1868..<br/>
    Once again<br/>
    Thank you for your work.<br/>
    <i>Wayne Sharp, 
    No known kinship to Thomas Edward, the child.<br/>
    P.S. No kin that I can ascertain, strangely Sharp is a very common name. 
    These Sharps lived in Williamson County.<br/>
    Information shared with and by Wayne Sharp and was from a surviving brother 
    of the deceased child. Updated for photos sent by this child's brother to 
    Wayne Sharp 13 Nov 2010.</i></b></p></blockquote>
