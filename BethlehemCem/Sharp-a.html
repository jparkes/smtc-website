    Thomas Edward Sharp.</br>
    The above 
    is an update on the grave of a child buried here some 80 years ago. </br>
    There was not found anything in our Bethlehem Cemetery records on this burial. We did 
    not even know there was a grave at plot 324. [Photos above now - 13 Nov 
    2010]</br>
    </br>
    The brother of this child E-mailed me after finding our listing on the 
    Bethlehem Cemetery site.</br>
    All the siblings of this child banded contributed to this memorial.</br>
    Once again your site has proven valuable and has helped in solving a 
    mystery, albeit one we did not even know existed.</br>
    I am sure there are a other such instances waiting to be discovered. A lot 
    can happen since 1868..</br>
    Once again</br>
    Thank you for your work.</br>
    </font><i>Wayne Sharp, 
    No known kinship to Thomas Edward, the child.</br>
    P.S. No kin that I can ascertain, strangely Sharp is a very common name. 
    These Sharps lived in Williamson County.</br>
    Information shared with and by Wayne Sharp and was from a surviving brother 
    of the deceased child. Updated for photos sent by this child's brother to 
    Wayne Sharp 13 Nov 2010.</i></font></b></blockquote>
