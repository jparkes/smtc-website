    Perhaps the inscription is not as translated by Wayne Sharp above. There is
    lettering after the birth date that looks like &quot;AIGT&quot; or
    &quot;AID&quot; or &quot;AIGE&quot;. Could this be the balance of he surname
    such as WASHBOARD or WASHBOAID or WASHBOAIGE&quot; or even another
    intrepretation. Another interpretation might perhaps be that it states: &quot;JBR WAS BORN MAY 1838 died MAY
    18TH 1888&quot;</br>
