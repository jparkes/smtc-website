</b>Unknown Soul thought to 
be the grave of Nannie Hardison, no dates known.</font><p align="center">
 
Wayne A., </br>
You have the following listed for the Bethlehem Cemetery:</br>
Unknown Soul, broken stone near entrance of cemetery, Plot #114.</br>
</br>
The Hawkins book contains two listing for a Nannie Hardison.</br>
One is identified, but one is listed as Hardison, Nannie, No dates.</br>
Although there are other Hardisons' buried in the cemetery there are no vacant 
plots adjacent to them.</br>
Also all plots 115 through 120 are Hardisons', plot 114 is marked unknown with a 
blank marble stone.</br>
Mr Hawkins worked with Ralph Whitesell a Cemetery Trustee and the Marshall 
County Historian at the time in compiling this listing so until I know better, 
and until someone else has better research, I am going to assign plot 114 as 
follows:</br>
</br>
Plot</br>
114</br>
</br>
Hardison, Nannie, No Dates, Marked with a small blank marble stone in first row 
near entrance. NFI available.</br>
Thank you</br>
&nbsp;Wayne Sharp, trustee, Bethlehem Cemetery, 20 Aug 2012.</br>
