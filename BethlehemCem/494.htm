<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#800000">Wayne A., <br>
You have the following listed for the Bethlehem Cemetery:<br>
Unknown Soul, broken stone near entrance of cemetery, Plot #114.<br>
<br>
The Hawkins book contains two listing for a Nannie Hardison.<br>
One is identified, but one is listed as Hardison, Nannie, No dates.<br>
Although there are other Hardisons' buried in the cemetery there are no vacant 
plots adjacent to them.<br>
Also all plots 115 through 120 are Hardisons', plot 114 is marked unknown with a 
blank marble stone.<br>
Mr Hawkins worked with Ralph Whitesell a Cemetery Trustee and the Marshall 
County Historian at the time in compiling this listing so until I know better, 
and until someone else has better research, I am going to assign plot 114 as 
follows:<br>
<br>
Plot<br>
114<br>
<br>
Hardison, Nannie, No Dates, Marked with a small blank marble stone in first row 
near entrance. NFI available.<br>
Thank you<br>
&nbsp;Wayne Sharp, trustee, Bethlehem Cemetery, 20 Aug 2012.<br>
