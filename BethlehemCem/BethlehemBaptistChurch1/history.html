	 This cemetery began as the Baird Family Cemetery with the first officially recorded burial being Sarah Jane McLean Baird in 1868. However, local legend has it, and there is a marker to that effect, that the first actuial burial was that of an unknown slave, presumably of the Baird household. </br>
	</br>
	On August 11, 1884 James W. Baird deeded the cemetery property to the Bethlehem Cumberland Presbyterian Church (Deed was officially recorded in Marshal County Tennessee September 25, 1894, see below).  The cemetery then became known as the Bethlehem Cemetery.</br></br>
	There was no community cemetery until the establishment of the Bethlehem
	Cemetery. After the establishment of the Bethlehem Cemetery there were
	disinterments from a family cemetery on the John J. Williamson farm, located across the road in Maury County, to the Bethlehem Cemetery. This was done, presumably, because the farm was to be subsequently sold to Thomas Jefferson Tindell in 1888.  Said farm has remained in the hands of the Tindell heirs to this day.
	</br>
	</br>
	The Cemetery is located in the Bethlehem Community on the eastern Marshall County side of U.S. Highway 431, approximately 10 miles north of Lewisburg, Tennessee and approximately half way between the Berlin community in Marshall County, and the Hardison Mill community in Maury/Marshall County, adjacent to the old Baird property that is currently owned by the Bill Turner family. The Cemetery is located approximately 3 miles from the Maury County Community of Leftwich on Old Sowell Mill Pike. </br>

	Deed as written August 11, 1884 and recorded September 25, 1894 in Marshall County, Book 1-2, page 84.  This instrument conveys the cemetery to the Elders of the Bethlehem Cumberland Presbyterian Church from the Baird Family.</br>

		It is reliably believed that some sort of meeting place was located here as early as 1815. It may have been the usual for that time, a brush arbor or a small log building. Local history indicates that, with the exception of the years 1984 and 1985, an active place of worship has occupied this property each year since that time.</br>

	The first church which was built has been described as a large and beautiful rural church. The double front doors opened into a vestibule which extended the full width of the church. A window in each end of the vestibule furnished light and ventilation. Stairs to the balcony were located at each end and a closet for storage was situated beneath the stairway. Two single doors lead into the main sanctuary. A row of columns down the center of the sanctuary supported the ceiling. There was a row of pews in the center and outside the two aisles. Two windows in each side of the sanctuary furnished additional light and ventilation. The building faced west and the pulpit was to the rear of the church. An organ sat to one side and the choir sat in the a-men corner. Two rows of oil lamps hung from the ceiling. The original church building burned 9
	May 1915. (No pictures of this church have been located to date.) </br>
	</br>
	When the present building was erected the north pillars of the old church were used in the foundation. The south pillars sit some 5 feet to the side because the new church is smaller than the one which burned. The lumber for the present church was bought from Doc Morris who ran a sawmill at Hardison Mill. Big Jim Davis did the sawing of the lumber. </br>
	</br>
	Services were held in the yard under the trees, until completion of the building. The present church building was completed in 1917 and renovated in the mid 1950s, with services being held in member's homes until completion of the renovation. It was again renovated in the late 1980s when purchased by the current Bethlehem Baptist Church. </br>
	</br>
	Rev. Robert Hall preached the final sermon on June 12, 1983 . </br>
	</br>
	The Bethlehem Church discontinued being a Cumberland Presbyterian church in August, 1983. The ruling elders were Eugene A. Sharp, Paul Shires, L. R. Cheatham. All the books and records of the church were sent to Memphis for archiving upon the official closing of the church. </br>
	</br>
	Some of the 20th century ministers of the Bethlehem Cumberland Presbyterian Church were: Rev. Thomas Mead Hendrix, Rev. Zumbro, Rev. B. F. Guinn, Rev. J. T. Colemen, Rev. Bill Ralston, Rev. W. C. Bryant, Rev. Bobby Oliver, Rev. Glenn Kapperman, Rev. Edwin Sain, Rev. Wayne Morgan, and Rev. Robert Hall.</br> </br>
