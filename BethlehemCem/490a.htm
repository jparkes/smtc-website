<font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Update 16 Jan 2010:<br>
WILLIAMSON, Eliza
Carr, b. Unknown, d. Unknown - Wife of John J. Williamson who was born in 1809,
Niece of Revolutionary Soldier John Fendal Carr<br>
<br>
Note from Wayne Sharp 16 Jan 2010: After much discussion with Rufus Williamson,
the unofficial Williamson family historian, he has come to the conclusion that
the unmarked spot next to John J. Williamson is indeed the grave site of John
J.'s wife although no dates have yet been determined and may never be. I have
added the following to my database and ask that you do so also. Should any dates
be forthcoming I will forward them to you. [WS 16 Jan 2010]<br>
<br>
Note also from Wayne Sharp 16 Jan 2010: The grave of Revolutionary Soldier John Fendal Carr mentioned above has
been lost.&nbsp; The only information we have indicates that his marker was
destroyed in the 1920s and that he is buried approximately 12 miles north from
Lewisburg on Franklin Pike. This puts the grave site in the vicinity in which
the Williamson/Tindell farm is currently located. Rufus, the
Williamson Family Historian speculates that John Fendal Carr's farm and the
Williamson farm might have been the same and his niece and husband may have
bought the land from his estate, although some records indicate his land was
just south of the Williamson farm, perhaps adjoining.<br>
