		<u>Bethlehem Cemetery History</u><br />
		James W. Baird transferred land for the Bethlehem Cemetery to the Bethlehem 
		Cumberland Presbyterian Church by deed dated August 11, 1884 (Deed was officially 
		recorded in Marshal County on September 25, 1894, see below).  Prior to this, the 
		cemetery was that of the Baird Family with the first officially recorded burial 
		being Sarah Jane McLean Baird in 1868.  However, local legend has it, and there 
		is a marker to that effect, that the first burial was that of an unknown slave, 
		presumably of the Baird household.<br /> <br />
		
		There was no community cemetery until the establishment of the Bethlehem Cemetery.
		After the establishment of the Bethlehem Cemetery there were disinterments from a 
		family cemetery on the John J. Williamson farm, located across the road in Maury 
		County, to the Bethlehem Cemetery.  This was done presumably because the farm was 
		to be subsequently sold to Thomas Jefferson Tindell in 1888, said farm currently 
		remains in the hands of the Tindell heirs. <br /><br />
		
		The Cemetery is located in the Bethlehem Community on U.S. Highway 431 10 miles north 
		of Lewisburg and approximately half way between the Berlin community in Marshall 
		County, Tennessee, and the Hardison Mill community in Maury/Marshall County, Tennessee, 
		adjacent to the old Baird property that is currently owned by the Bill Turner 
		family.<br /><br />
		
		The responsibility for the Bethlehem Cemetery was relinquished by the Bethlehem Cumberland 
		Presbyterian Church in the 1970s and is now administered by a Board of Trustees. The 
		Cemetery has subsequently been expanded with land purchased from the Bill Turner 
		Family.</div><br /><br />

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethlehem Cumberland Presbyterian Church - Circa 1960
		<br /><br />

		9 Mar 1831. Nathaniel Smith, Sr. gave 1 A each to the Presbyterian Church, 
		the old Regular Baptist Church, the Methodist Church, and the Cumberland Presbyterian 
		Church <i>(<u>Note</u>: This church building is near the current Bethlehem Cemetery on the E side 
		of Franklin Road (U.S. 431).  The location of the other churches, if established, has 
		not been currently determined as in 1831 Nathaniel Smith, Sr. owned 2,000+ acres 
		in this area.)</i>, <br /><br />
		
		"For and in consideration of the regard and esteem I have toward the above named churches, I, Nathaniel 
		Smith, Sr., of Maury Co. hath given and granted and by these presents doth give 
		and grant unto each of&nbsp;the above named churches 1 A of land for the purpose of building 
		a house thereon for a meeting house and school house lying situated and being in 
		Maury Co. bounded as follows: Beginning at a dogwood a little N of the road leading 
		from Col. Williamson Smith's to Matthew Moores' Esq. near where said road crosses 
		the Franklin Road, due S to the divisional line between Capt. Nathaniel Smith and 
		Fendal Carr, W with the line 18.5 poles, N 9.5 poles to a small dogwood, thence to 
		the beginning". <br /> 
		Witnesses: Wm. Hughes, Charles A. Smith (Maury Co. p-146).<br /><br /> 
		
		It is reliably believed that some sort of meeting place was located here as early 
		as 1815. It may have been the usual for that time, a brush arbor or a small log 
		building.<br /><br />
		
		The first church which was built has been described as a large and beautiful rural 
		church. The double front doors opened into a vestibule which extended the full width 
		of the church. A window in each end of the vestibule furnished light and ventilation. 
		Stairs to the balcony were located at each end and a closet for storage was situated 
		beneath the stairway. Two single doors lead into the main sanctuary.
		A row of columns down the center of the sanctuary supported the ceiling. There was 
		a row of pews in the center and outside the two aisles. Two windows in each side 
		of the sanctuary furnished additional light and ventilation. The building faced 
		west and the pulpit was to the rear of the church. An organ sat to one side and 
		the choir sat in the a-men corner. Two rows of oil lamps hung from the ceiling. 
		The original church building burned 9 May 1915. (No pictures of this church have
		been located to date.)<br /><br />
		
		When the present building was erected the north pillars of the old church were used 
		in the foundation. The south pillars sit some 5 feet to the side because the new 
		church is smaller than the one which burned. The lumber for the present church 
		was bought from Doc Morris who ran a sawmill at Hardison Mill.  Big Jim Davis did 
		the sawing of the lumber.<br /><br />
		
		Services were held in the yard under the trees, until completion of the building. 
		The present church building was completed in 1917 and renovated in the mid 1950s, 
		with services being held in member's homes until completion of the renovation.  
		It was again renovated in the late 1980s when purchased by the current Bethlehem Baptist
		Church.<br /><br />
		
		On June 12, 1983 Rev. Robert Hall preached the final sermon. <br /><br />
		
		The Bethlehem Church discontinued being a Cumberland Presbyterian church in August, 
		1983. The ruling elders were Paul Shires, L. R. Cheatham, and Eugene A. Sharp. 
		All the books and records of the church were sent to the Memphis Presbytery upon the 
		official closing of the church. <br /><br />
		
		Some of the 20th century ministers of the Bethlehem Cumberland Presbyterian 
		Church were:
		Rev. Thomas Mead Hendrix, Rev. Zumbro, B. F. Guinn, J. T. Colemen, Rev. Bill Ralston, W. C. Bryant, 
		Bobby Oliver, Rev. Glenn Kapperman, Edwin Sain, Rev. Wayne Morgan, and Rev. Robert Hall.<br /><br />
		
		The Bethlehem church building subsequently opened its doors as the current Bethlehem Baptist 
		Church.<br />
