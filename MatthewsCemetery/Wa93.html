WALKER, Kesiah V., d. 5 Oct 1845. 34 years. &quot;Consort Wm. W. Walker.&quot;
If I understand this correctly Kesiah Walker was the first wife of Wm. Walker
and died in 1845 and Wm and his second wife Margaret B. Alexander married in
1847. Inscription: &quot;In Memory of Kesiah V. Walker Consort of Wm M. Walker
who departed this life on the 5th of October 1845 in the 34th year of her age.
Here lies the body of a noble hearted woman. Her great loss is felt in the
family and region where she last survived but what is our loss is hoped to be
heaven's <u>gane</u>.&quot; This stone is in danger of fracturing and losing the
inscription. The bottom row has already recently peeled away taking some of the
inscription.&nbsp;</br>
