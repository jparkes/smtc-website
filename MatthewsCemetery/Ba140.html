BALDRIDGE, Ann, 6 May 1807 - 25 Apr 1831.Â "Here lies the body of Ann
Baldridge. She was born the 6th of May 1807 and died 25th of april 1831."
As you can see we are nearing the end of the photography of this cemetery. We
started in east side and progressed further until we were into these woods. As
you notice here there are only a few stones in front of the camera. This is the
oldest part of the cemetery and was used first. As deaths occurred it was
filled toward the east or behind us in this photo.<br/>
