<br>
</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">James Washington Matthews was a 
prominent farmer, surveyor and school teacher in early Maury County.<br>
He kept a Dairy nearly fifty years from 1831 to 1878, but only the years 1844 
thru 1869 were properly preserved. Two other volumes are still missing. All of 
the copies were lost for several years when the Historical Society disbanded in 
the early 1900s, dispersed &amp; lost the volumes. In 1965 a volume which included 
the years from 1858 to 1869 including the Civil War turned up in an attic of an 
old house in Columbia. Later another section covering 1844 thru 1857 was 
discovered by the Archives team headed by Bob Duncan of Maury County. If you 
know of any of these missing volumes including the periods of 1831 thru 1844, 
and 1869 thru 1878 please contact the Maury County Archives or the Tennessee 
Archives in Nashville. Several prominent authors of Maury County history have 
sourced the first volume to turn up including Jill Garrett in several 
publications, Marise P. Lightfoot &amp; Evelyn B. Shackelford appearing in the book 
&quot;They Passed This Way&quot;. See Historic Maury Page 83-84 for more details &amp; what 
you can do to gain access to this historic material.<br>
