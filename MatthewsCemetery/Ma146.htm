MATTHEWS, Jinny H., 12 Dec 1795 - 28 May 1864, &quot;Jinny H. Matthews -
daughter of John &amp; - Margaret Matthews - was born December - 12 1795 &amp;
died May 28, 1864. ??Threescore &amp; ten years do sum ?? days &amp; years we
see;&nbsp; ason of more ...me, fourscore??.&quot; Wish I had taken more pains to gather the epitaph
from the bottom fracture. I almost had to dig this one up. Part of the stone was
visible from above ground.</br>
