MATTHEWS, Margaret, died 21 Dec 1841. Age 32 (or 37) years. "Here lies the
body of Margaret Matthews, Wife of John Matthews who departed this life on
theÂ  21st of December 1841 Ag-ed 32 (or 37) years." I believe MCTC has
this lady as passing in 1811. That might be right, but I see the date as 1841 and the dates of the other
stones of this style are no earlier than around the 1820s. Fours and ones are
difficult to distinguish sometimes.<br/>
