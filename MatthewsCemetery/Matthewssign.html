  <pre align="center"><b>These are photos of the entrance and sign to Matthews Cemetery. As one can see there is still plenty of room for 
new burials in this cemetery. The photos are looking west at the cemetery while standing near the entrance and next 
to the sign. The road is on our left past the thicket. The sign says: "MATTHEWS CEMETERY established 1811." 
Judging from the patination (normal discolorations that form on hard stone over time, in this case, chalky blue) I would 
venture the entrance sign is older than 50 years and if I really made an educated guess I would say it was set 
in the early 1900s. OK, now someone prove me wrong or that it is even older. I believe it to be high quality 
limestone and not composed of granite.
