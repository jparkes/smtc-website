HANNA, Rachel
Virginia, 12 Sep 1849-26 Aug 1851. 01-11-14. "Daughter of A. H. &amp; M. J.
Hanna." (Stone dislocated and lying under a tree with amongst a pile of
stones. I scratched around in the pile of stones but did locate any other
inscribed memorials but could not be absolutely sure there were not others. At one time
I believe this was a box tomb and these were the base stones
that have since fallen into shambles. Where the top is located I do not know,
but this old Hanna family did not usually have the top inscribed, but inserted a
small inscribed stone on the end like the one for Rachel.Â <br/>
