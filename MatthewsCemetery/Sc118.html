This broken footstone can be found near the oldest part of the cemetery further
up the hill. It is nearly under the displaced box tomb (top) for Eliza Bryson.
It has the initials J.S. on it and because the James Scott memorial is the only
possible known stone that could be matched up to this foot stone I chose to
display it here. The stone is found 100 feet to the west of the James Scott
stone so I am unable to say that it can be placed as his. The footstone can be
dated as between 1820 and 1840 based on its style. <br/>
