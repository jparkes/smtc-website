We are continuing to photograph the rows as we progress thru the cemetery toward the back. If you 
study these photos closely you can begin to identify the stones from the listing photos by flipping 
back and forth between the area photos and the individual ones. I have marked the graves of the W. 
I. &amp; M. E. Goad children with text in the above photo. There are no adult stones for the Goad family 
in this cemetery. This makes an interesting genealogy question deserving of an answer by someone 
interested in the Goad family history. We know the W. I. &amp; M. E. Goad family was connected here 
because they left three small deceased children in this cemetery beginning in 1872 and leaving the last 
one here in 1883. We also know they were here at least from 1872 until 1883 or the dates of the first <br clear="left"/>and last child passing. So where did the parents of the Goad children go from here since it is all but <br clear="right"/>proven they did not stay here and affiliate with this community for the duration of their lives. I would 
first look for them somewhere in Middle Tennessee then; in West Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri 
since those were the most prevalent destinations of migrants in those days. The book "Maury County Tennessee 
Cemeteries" has 20 occurrences of the surname Goad in its 600+ pages and that is where I would start to 
answer this question. Maybe this site will have that answer someday at the click of a search engine if 
one is every found with enough capability to do the job.
