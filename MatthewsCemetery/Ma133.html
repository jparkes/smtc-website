MATTHEWS, Robert F., 20 Oct 1802 - 19 Mar 1865. Full Inscription: "Robert
F. Matthews was born October 20, 1802. was murdered </b><b>by
some unknown person on  March 19 1865.  I to the hills will lift mine
eyes from whence doeth come mine aid. My safety cometh from the Lord who Heaven
&amp; earth hath made." I wonder if this killing was also related to the
many such acts around the time of ending of the Civil War and afterward for
several years around Mt Pleasant Tennessee. See Howard Cemetery for more details
on that.  <br/>
