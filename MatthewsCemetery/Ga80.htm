GALLOWAY, Maggie A. Hanna, 23 Oct 1834 - 23 Aug 1903, &quot;Love&quot;, Wife of
J. B. Galloway. &quot; (Captain John B. Galloway, buried in Hopewell Cemetery.)
Three of their small children are known to be buried here also according to the
records of this site. Maggie was identified as Margaret in the Hopewell records.
Wonder if that is an error.</br>
