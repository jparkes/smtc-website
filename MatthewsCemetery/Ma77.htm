</font></b><b>The pieces
of this broken and shaled old stone was found stacked behind the memorial
of Joseph Matthews, 1779-1847. Perhaps it was the original stone for Joseph. It
is a style that could have been in use as late as 1847, but mostly was used between 1825 and
1840. Also the stone (photo below) for Joseph appears to be a later replacement
or a style used from about 1870 to 1900.</br>
