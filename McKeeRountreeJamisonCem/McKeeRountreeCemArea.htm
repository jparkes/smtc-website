<b>The view looks
southwest from near Hardison Road. Both of the stones in the immediate vicinity
are unmarked. The white military marker is for Nelson McKee a Confederate soldier
who died shortly after being released from a northern prison.</br>

Panning the camera around toward the south yields this scene. Many of the stones
out there are misplaced footstones which were taken from their original place at
the foot of a grave and placed in the row with other headstones creating the
look of consistent rows of headstones when that is not the case.&nbsp;</br>
I witnessed an unusual scene between farm animals while there. The horses in the
pasture straight ahead and the horses in the pasture on our right got into a
dual when they came up next to each other across the fence. That occurred in
those trees in the upper part of the photo. One never heard such a raucous as
they set about stamping their feet, snorting &amp; prancing around making noises
I have never heard horses make. I thought they were going to break out into a
serious fight but it mostly staged as a bluffing show. I suppose it must have
been started by two competitive opposing stallions across the fences from
different farms.</b><b><i></br>
