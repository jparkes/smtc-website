Revolutionary War Soldier<br>
(age 84 yrs.)<br>
(Revolutionary War. Age on tombstone incorrect according to the book They Passed 
This way pg B69.<br>
(also spelled &quot;Hutcheson&quot; &amp; &quot;Hutchison&quot; in pension application,) was born ca 
1757 in North Carolina. When hostilities against the British started in 1776, 
James was living in Mecklenburg Co., N.C., a center of revolutionary sentiment, 
and enlisted in Col. Gadsden's Regiment of N.C. Militia. He was sent to South 
Carolina where he served for a year. He re-enlisted in 1776, serving in the 
Battle of Stono, near Charleston, S.C. He had married Elizabeth (last name 
unknown) and moved to Lancaster Dist., S.C. about 1780 and then to Maury Co., 
Tenn., sometime around 1816. His four children were: Sarah, William, Elizabeth 
and James. He died on 27 Nov 1836 and his wife lived until 9 Apr 1949. His 
tombstone states that he was 84 at the time of his death, but his age, as stated 
on various pension applications show that he was born ca. 1757, thus in 1838, he 
would have been 79 years old. (See Lightfoot, Let the Drums Roll, pp. 102-103.)<br>
