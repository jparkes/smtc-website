From the intersection of I 65 and Hwy 50, go west about 1.5 miles to the Fred
White Road and turn right (north). Almost
immediately turn left on Rick Hight Road and go about 1/4 mile to the old
antebellum home of the Robertson Bryant family on the right (the road will
sharply bend to
the left if you miss the turn off). With permission from the owners of the
private property, turn right. The cemetery is about 150 yards to the east of the
home.&nbsp;</p>

        gone now due to destruction by cattle.&nbsp; Robertson Bryant and Nancy
        Amis are my g-g-g grandparents.&nbsp; My mother and her sister remember
        this cemetery from their childhood (I would guess 1930's and 1940's) and
        remember the ornate fence that once surrounded the cemetery.&nbsp; All
        of this is no longer around and the cattle are free to crush and knock
        over the stones.&nbsp; Have you ever taken pictures of these stones????&nbsp;
        The owners (at least - use to be owners) were willing to grant access to
        the cemetery.&nbsp; It is a very small family cemetery.<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Your
        Word file, along with the embedded topo map, came through just fine.&nbsp;
        I would love for you to publish pictures of the (Robertson) Bryant
        Cemetery.&nbsp; Let me see if I can help a little more with your ability
        to locate the cemetery. &nbsp; <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">First
        let me recommend that you only try this in the winter months.&nbsp;
        Being able to locate the cemetery when the&nbsp;plant foliage&nbsp;is so
        thick, makes it almost impossible to find (unless the owners take you
        there).<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">From
        Lewisburg, traveling northwest on Hwy 50 towards Columbia:<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        You will pass by&nbsp;Bryant Station and pass Interstate 65;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        In about one or two miles, you will see a road (Fred White Road) that
        turns off to the right.&nbsp; I believe there is a sign that says
        &quot;Philadelphia;&quot; but I can't remember for sure.&nbsp; Turn
        right.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        You will then (almost immediately) come to an intersecting road.&nbsp;
        You will want to turn left.&nbsp; This road, while (Called Rick Hight Rd
        or was the old hwy 50) paved for a while, will turn into an unimproved
        road (gravel -- deteriorated pavement?), as I remember.&nbsp; You will
        pass several homes and trailers.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        As you are traveling down this road (it is not far), you will see the
        home of Robertson Bryant off to your right.&nbsp; It is a classic home
        of the early 1800s -- two stories&nbsp;with 4 stately columns.&nbsp; It
        was painted white (with a green roof) the last time I saw it.&nbsp; <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        Assuming you are now standing in front of the home, you would&nbsp;turn
        to your left and walk east for about 100 yards.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        In front of you should be the edge of an open field, except for a
        grouping of trees and I believe a power pole (not the huge transmission
        lines).&nbsp; There may also be a wire fence along the edge -- again I
        can't remember.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        Once you get to this grouping of trees, you should be able to&nbsp;locate
        the (remnants of) stones.&nbsp; <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Other
        things of interest:<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        The current owner(s) have maintained a wooden fence in the front of the
        home.&nbsp; As you walk outside the wooden gate, the yard starts to drop
        off.&nbsp; At this drop off, you will notice a wall of stacked stones.&nbsp;
        I was told this was built&nbsp;intentionally (with an elevation
        difference) so that carriages/wagons could pull up next to the wall and
        the visitor (presumably the woman)&nbsp;would only have to step across
        to level ground.&nbsp; Pretty ingenious.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">-&nbsp;
        The owners were in 1991 the Reese's. They were attempting to restore the
        home.&nbsp; They had found remnants of the detached kitchen off the back
        and had removed the interior&nbsp;walls to expose the yellow popular
        studs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea the
        conditions of the home now since I have not been there.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Again,
        if I were rich, I would have this cemetery fenced and stones restored.&nbsp;
        Robertson Bryant and Nancy Amis had 15 children and&nbsp;are the
        progenitors of (probably) thousands of current-day individuals.&nbsp; It
        would be wonderful to preserve (and to remember) their resting place.&nbsp;
        Their daughter, Ann (1826-1860), is buried there as well.&nbsp; Ann died
        of consumption.&nbsp; There are probably others buried there too.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Let
        me know when you are thinking about making the trip.&nbsp; If possible,
        I may try to make the&nbsp;trip at the same time.&nbsp; Ronnie Erwin,
        past president of the Maury County Historical Society and a descendant
        of Robertson &amp; Nancy Bryant, has also expressed an interest in

        Commentary by Wayne Austin: As of 9/1/2005 no one has been able to
        secure permission due to the land owners lack of public access. To visit
        the cemetery that is necessary in my mind though it really may not be
        needed since this cemetery belongs to the descendents and not the land
        owner. However, one must know the right-of-way in order to visit an old
        abandoned cemetery.</o:p>
