William Dooley, son of James Dooley and first wife Margaret McKinney was born
presumably in Virginia in 1772. He married Jane Ferilla Rutledge, daughter of
William and Chloe Rutledge in Williamson County, TN. They settled in Maury
County, TN around 1805 where William was a founding justice for the County. He
was a large landowner, farmer and was an officer in the militia for Maury
County, TN in the War of 1812. He and Jane had twelve children - descendants of
whom are still in Columbia today. This
is a double box tomb shown in the center of the above photo. The inscription may not
now be readable.<br/>
