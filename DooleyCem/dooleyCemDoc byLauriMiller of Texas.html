<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="448510413-22052007">I would love for you to 
post those surveys.  However, please note that Mr. Hawkins made an error in 
the name of James Dooley, - he does NOT have a middle initial S - that came from 
poor spacing on the engraver's part.  His name is just James Dooley (no 
S).  (Sorry pet peeve of mine).</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="448510413-22052007">As for the Cemetery, I 
would be most grateful for anything that you can do to locate and document the 
stones there.  I was there for the first time last October as I live in 
Texas.  It was a dream come true for me after years of research.  We 
had the dedication of the patriot marker on James Dooley's grave.  The 
local scout troop cleaned it up and there are some local Dooleys that are making 
arrangements for it's renovation into a meditation garden setting.  Jim 
Dooley is the county Tax Assessor and Collector and Eddie Dooley was the former 
chief of police in Columbia.  The county has agreed to let inmates do the 
work if the Dooleys feed them and provide supervision and tools.  I so wish 
I was there to spear head this, but am too far away.  I prod as much as I 
dare through email.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="448510413-22052007">At any rate, I repaired a 
stone or two when I was there, but did not clean any because they are limestone 
and fairly brittle.  Any tips on cleaning limestone?  I found a 
great thing for repairing stones called Rockite and it's a gray epoxy that sets 
up fairly quick and is like concrete.  There is a second vault that is 
crushed.  A lady at the Archives remembers playing in that cemetery as a 
child and might could help clarify things if you want to seek her 
out.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="448510413-22052007">I was told by a local 
that the graves of slaves also are there, but I've not seen anything to confirm 
that.  The ground was very uneven and I saw places I believed digging would 
turn up a stone or remnant.  I tried putting some pieces together, but my 
time was so limited.  I still grieve not getting to work in that cemetery 
for several days.  Like you, I knew I could find more if I had tools and 
time.  Anything you do will be greatly appreciated.  The cemetery was 
featured last October on the front page of the Columbia Herald.  It is 
located behind the Grace Nazarene Church on Highland.  Turn down behind the 
parking lot on a private drive called Grace Lane.  Go to the last house on 
the left and it is down behind the house.  The church owns that property 
including houses and has granted easement access to anyone wanting to go to that 
cemetery.  We were allowed to park down the driveway.  The local 
Dooleys have gotten it this far, but there is so much more to do.  They 
have plans to eventually mount the broken stone pieces in a wall with a bench 
for meditation or some such.  </span></div>
