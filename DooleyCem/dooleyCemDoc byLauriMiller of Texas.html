<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=448510413-22052007>I would love for you to 
post those surveys.&nbsp; However, please note that Mr. Hawkins made an error in 
the name of James Dooley, - he does NOT have a middle initial S - that came from 
poor spacing on the engraver's part.&nbsp; His name is just James Dooley (no 
S).&nbsp; (Sorry pet peeve of mine).</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=448510413-22052007>As for the Cemetery, I 
would be most grateful for anything that you can do to locate and document the 
stones there.&nbsp; I was there for the first time last October as I live in 
Texas.&nbsp; It was a dream come true for me after years of research.&nbsp; We 
had the dedication of the patriot marker on James Dooley's grave.&nbsp; The 
local scout troop cleaned it up and there are some local Dooleys that are making 
arrangements for it's renovation into a meditation garden setting.&nbsp; Jim 
Dooley is the county Tax Assessor and Collector and Eddie Dooley was the former 
chief of police in Columbia.&nbsp; The county has agreed to let inmates do the 
work if the Dooleys feed them and provide supervision and tools.&nbsp; I so wish 
I was there to spear head this, but am too far away.&nbsp; I prod as much as I 
dare through email.</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=448510413-22052007>At any rate, I repaired a 
stone or two when I was there, but did not clean any because they are limestone 
and fairly brittle.&nbsp; Any&nbsp;tips on cleaning limestone?&nbsp; I found a 
great thing for repairing stones called Rockite and it's a gray epoxy that sets 
up fairly quick and is like concrete.&nbsp; There is a second vault that is 
crushed.&nbsp; A lady at the Archives remembers playing in that cemetery as a 
child and might could help clarify things if you want to seek her 
out.</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV dir=ltr align=left><SPAN class=448510413-22052007>I was told by a local 
that the graves of slaves also are there, but I've not seen anything to confirm 
that.&nbsp; The ground was very uneven and I saw places I believed digging would 
turn up a stone or remnant.&nbsp; I tried putting some pieces together, but my 
time was so limited.&nbsp; I still grieve not getting to work in that cemetery 
for several days.&nbsp; Like you, I knew I could find more if I had tools and 
time.&nbsp; Anything you do will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; The cemetery was 
featured last October on the front page of the Columbia Herald.&nbsp; It is 
located behind the Grace Nazarene Church on Highland.&nbsp; Turn down behind the 
parking lot on a private drive called Grace Lane.&nbsp; Go to the last house on 
the left and it is down behind the house.&nbsp; The church owns that property 
including houses and has granted easement access to anyone wanting to go to that 
cemetery.&nbsp; We were allowed to park down the driveway.&nbsp; The local 
Dooleys have gotten it this far, but there is so much more to do.&nbsp; They 
have plans to eventually mount the broken stone pieces in a wall with a bench 
for meditation or some such.&nbsp; </SPAN></DIV>
