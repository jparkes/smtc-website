<p align="center">GODWIN, Col. 
A. S., Nov 1823 - 9 Sep 1896. (Col., Co. E, 48th Tenn Inf., C.S.A.; Agent, L &amp; N 
R.R.; Godwin village &amp; this cemetery named for him) obit<br/>
<br/>
Col. A. S. Godwin, who had been failing health for several 
months, died at his residence at Godwin Station in this county last Wednesday 
evening at 5:30 o'clock, in the 73rd year of his age. Rev. Mr. Nolan conducted 
the funeral yesterday morning at 10:00 o'clock, at Godwin's Chapel. Interment in 
the family burying grounds.<br/>
<br/>
There was no better citizen in Maury County than Col. Godwin. He was large in 
statue, and in mind, and in heart. A man of kind impulses and generous acts. 
Possessed of ample means, with only the modest demands of himself and his wife 
to support, what others may have hoarded or spent in luxurious living, he gave 
to charity. No one ever went hungry or cold or without raiment at the reach of 
his hand; for he was always ready to listen to their appeals and relieve their 
necessities. He was a public benefactor, and stood as few equals as a friend to 
the friendless, the father to the fatherless, and the counselor - wise, 
conservative and honest - to those who needed advice.<br/>
<br/>
He was as brave in war as he was great in peace. He was Lieutenant Colonel of 
the 48th Tennessee Regiment, and no more gallant officer wore the gray. The 
courage he displayed on the field of battle, the tender solicitude in the camp 
for every soldier, won for him the ardent admiration and undying love of all his 
men.<br/>
<br/>
Col. Godwin never had any children. He leaves a wife to mourn the loss of a 
devoted husband and dear companion; he leaves to sympathize with her a friend 
wherever he was known.<br/>
