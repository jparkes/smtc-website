Mrs. Nettie Sparkman, age 33, wife of Walter W. Sparkman, died his morning at 
the residence of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. P. M. Thompson near Union on Snow 
Creek. Although her death was expected, as she had been lingering for some time, 
it was quite a shock to the entire community. She was a bright, good, Christian 
woman and was greatly beloved by her many friends and relatives. She was a 
devoted member of the Methodist church and was always found at her post of duty 
when physically able. She is survived by her father, mother, husband, four 
brothers, Jim, Charley and Joe, of Reeves, West Tennessee, and Walter Thompson 
who resided at home, and two sisters, Mrs. Naomi Baker and Mrs. Ida Kirkpatrick.<br>
<br>
The funeral will be held Sunday at 11:00 o'clock at the residence of her 
parents... Interment in the Godwin cemetery at Union....<br>
