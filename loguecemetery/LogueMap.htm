Here we can see the roads needed to get to this little small family cemetery on 
the side of the Campbellsville Pike. It is across from Richardson Lane on 
Campbellsville Pike about six miles south of Columbia Tennessee<Br>

cemetery is on the east side of the road between the creek and Campbellville
Pike Road. One large stone is there to represent the Logue family.</br>

This is the ultimate map since it shows more features than others. The Logue 
Cemetery is marked here with a red check.</span></b><center><b><i>
