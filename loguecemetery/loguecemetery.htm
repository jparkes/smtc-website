<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:navy">&nbsp;Logue Cemetery may be found just across the
Campbell Pike on the east side at a point opposite where Richardson Road
terminates. It is about .25 miles north of the Glenwood Church and Cemetery. You
should find one tall style memorial of the Logue Family with inscriptions on all
four sides about 30 feet east from the road. This cemetery was on the Logue Farm at one time in
the 1800s.&nbsp;Mr. Fred Hawkins in Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries says there
are six fieldstones marking other graves. He also has listed three persons two
of which bear the surname Logue that are believed to be interred here without
inscribed markers.&nbsp;</span></b>
