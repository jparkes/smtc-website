<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>On September 18, 1910</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>The angel of death visited the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Lucius Love and took for its victim their little son Collins, age 3
years, nine months, and six days. His bright face and sweet, sunny disposition
made every one love him who knew him. It seems so sad to part with our dear
little darling. But our loss is heaven's eternal gain, for Jesus has said,
&quot;Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is
the kingdom of heaven.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Funeral services were conducted by Bro. W.T.
Boaz, and he was laid to rest at the family burying ground near Cathey's Creek.
Oh! What a sad, sad fate to see the little white casket pass through the gate.<br>
