Unknown possibly the spouse or other relative of Elizabeth Isom. It is the first box tomb you will
come to in the cemetery and has no visible inscription. It defies age analysis,
but was probably put in place before the more formal stones of the other Blair
and Isom families in the 1820s. Being side by side with Elizabeth Isom may mean
it belongs to her family. Possibly her spouse.&nbsp;<i></br>
