cemetery is also called Blair-Love Cemetery. Go out Hwy 412/Hampshire Pike past
Cross Bridges and turn right (or north) on Booker Farm Road. Go 2 1/2 miles.
After the third sharp (left) bend in the road go another 1/4 mile and look to
your left at the cemetery near the road.</br>

map shows what you will see as you approach the cemetery.&nbsp; The cemetery is
near the road but before the line of forest up ahead on your left. One can
actually see the stones lined up north to south and facing east with this map.
There will be a few tall trees lining the road between the road and the cemetery<i></br>
