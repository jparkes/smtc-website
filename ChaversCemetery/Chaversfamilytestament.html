  <pre align="center">The Johnson story as written in "History of the Mt. Joy Cumberland Presbyterian 1815 - 1996 and The Mt. Joy 
Community"; Eloise York McClain and Evelyn Liles Luckett; pg 67. "Mr. Johnson's family lived at Sandy Hook. 
He had a sister there that they would visit once in a while. Once when Joe and Annie were small they walked from 
Mt. Joy to Sandy Hook by themselves and spent the night with the aunt. The next day they started home and night 
overtook them. They were walking through the Chavers' settlement on Massey road. One of the Chaver's families knew it wasn't 
safe for them to try to make it home by themselves in the dark. They kept them in their home until the next morning. 
The Chavers were a real nice (black) family." 
These books can be purchased from Evelyn contact her at the Church.</pre>
