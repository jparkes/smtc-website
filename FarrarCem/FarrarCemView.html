This is the Farrar Cemetery. The Farrar graves are outside the fence and the
Jones Graves are inside, but the far side of the fence is collapsed. There are
many graves marked by fieldstones. They are mostly located inside the chain
linked fence where they are more likely to be left standing.<br/>

We are looking southeast
at the fallen Farrar memorials. These are largely box tombs that are fallen.
Four of them to be exact. As far as I could see there were no inscriptions on
the tops of them.Â <br/>

This photo was snapped while standing on the Rock Springs Road and shooting up
across the cemetery. The cemetery is among the cedars and pines or the dark
shadowed trees where their foliage remains in place in the winter.</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br/>
