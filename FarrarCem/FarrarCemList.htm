to your left and you will begin to notice a bank above the road. Just about the
same time you will notice a farm road with a locked gate in place. The cemetery is
about 40 yards on the left from the edge of the road southeast of that gate. </font></b>

<p><b><font size="2" color="#000080">This was once a nice cemetery but through the years it has been almost
destroyed by neglect and abuse. Some 15 to 20 fieldstones, the rock wall around
the &quot;Jones&quot; section, the nice vaults, etc. show that this was a large and
important cemetery about the turn of the century. Many of the box tomb tops are
missing, just sunken below the ground, or turned over facing the ground. There
may be more inscriptions that can be read if that were corrected. There are four
rock lined vaults in the Farrar Family grave area, with the tops scattered, but
best we can tell without
inscriptions.<br>

This cemetery listing was shown in the various books of the past. Mr. Fred
Lee Hawkins &amp; Rev. Dwain Brown, accompanied by Allan, Rev. Brown's three
year old son helped present it in the book Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries, listed 14 Mar 1986 on page 107. Before that
it was listed in the book They Passed This Way, page C-41, about 1967.&nbsp;While
some of this info came from the above books much of it came from descendents
with various ancestral books having common original sources.&nbsp; [Photos dated
