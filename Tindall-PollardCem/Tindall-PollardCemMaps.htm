<b>Go west on Williamsport Pike (Hwy. 50) and turn 
south on Tindell Lane. After passing through the rail road underpass turn </br>
right into the first farm lane. This leads to the historic Tindell House, which is 
listed on the National Registry and </br>
is now (1987) owned by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Leroy Gibson. The cemetery is located in the field 
about 100 yards behind the house. [1987 Fred Lee Hawkins]</br>
Directions still good in 20 Sep 2010. House has been restored by current owners, 
Paul &amp; his wife Cyndy (Hubbell) Gibson. </br>
