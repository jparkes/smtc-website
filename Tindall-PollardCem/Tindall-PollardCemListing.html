TINDELL, John B., </b>16 Jun 1815 - 25 Jul 1840, eldest 
son of N. B. &amp; Elizabeth Tindell. (N.B. &amp; Elizabeth Tindall are interred in the 
Zion Churchyard Cemetery)<b><br/>
</b><br/>
This cemetery is enclosed in a low rock wall and 
has been allowed to grow up badly in bushes and weeds. All of the graves are 
covered by box tombs. See Zion Cemetery listing for other members of these 
families. Some graves that were originally here were later moved to Zion.<br/>
I was told by Paul Gibson that years ago the graves of several graves were moved 
to Zion Cemetery from here but that none of the tombstones were moved. This 
cannot be verified by the Zion Church listings assuming those records are 
complete. There are no duplicate listings.   </p>
