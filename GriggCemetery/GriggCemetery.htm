</b><b>Patrick Henry Grigg &amp; Samuel J. Grigg inherited the farm after the death of their parents. Then Andrew J. Grigg, son of P.H., inherited the farm after the death of his parents. 
After the death of Andrew J. his wife sold the&nbsp;land&nbsp; in 1913. She went to live with one of her children &amp; was not buried on the Grigg farm. The others buried there could be friends or pioneers.</br>
Unmarked stones &amp; other markings are present that are not readable. These people lived on the farm during those years &amp; died there &amp; would most certainly be buried there.</br>
Catherine &amp; Rebecca Grigg, two daughters of Samuel Grigg, took care of their elderly parents until their deaths, they inherited some land &amp; monies from the sale of land for their
loving care.</br>
Samuel &amp; Mary P. Grigg purchased this land in 1812 &amp; raised their family there, both died there &amp; are buried on the farm. They are the parents of the other Grigg children.

This small family cemetery is located on the old Grigg farm in Maury County close to the Giles County line. It is on Fountain Creek, also near the town of Culleoka. It is in
a pasture in a wooded area on the slopes of a hill. This farm was in the Grigg family from 1812 to 1913 when it was sold to someone else. This cemetery was read in 1977 by a
Grigg descendant of Andrew J. Grigg and maintained by the family and contributed here.</br>

This little family cemetery is on private Property, the current unknown owners of the old Grigg Farm place. It was in my 5th Great Grandfather's family for about 112 years. 
Then sold in the 1913. There are eight stones with names on them, and also markers for others. We are pretty sure who six of them would be. The only description of it is, that it 
was on the Grigg farm in Maury Co., Tn on the Giles Co., line in a wooded area by a pine power pole line. So I do not have an address. It would probably be hard to find without
out knowing the farm house. It was in the District 6 Fountain Creek area. I wish it had been a town cemetery, because I know the cemetery is in danger of being destroyed as 
time passes. There is no one to care anymore.</br>
