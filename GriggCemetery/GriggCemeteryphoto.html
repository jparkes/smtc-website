This stone in front of us above belongs to this listing: GRIGG, Infant Daughter
Grigg of P.H. and Gille Grigg b. May 6, 1860 d. May 6, 1860. That is the
footstone on our left and the grave is in between. The other broken memorials
are mostly piled against the old Sugar Maple tree. Many of them also look like children's memorials.
I would say the large Maple tree would be a help in finding this cemetery except
from the dropping limbs. That means it is probably dying and may not be there today.  [Commentary by WA
