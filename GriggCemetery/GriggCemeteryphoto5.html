GRIGG, Samuel J., 10 Jul 1823 - 18 Oct 1898, Confederate Soldier, Son of Samuel
Grigg. The birth date in this stone is incorrect. It has been inscribed as 1853.
James served in the Civil War sometime between 1861 and 1865 he could not have
been a Civil War Soldier and be born in 1853. We know his actual birth date to
be 1823 and not 1853. [Linda Bock]</br>
