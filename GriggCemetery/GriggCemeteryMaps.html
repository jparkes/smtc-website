This aerial view from Bing shows a promising location for this cemetery in the 
middle of a slope up a hill to our right. The spring branch and Grigg Hollow is 
present here and the trail of trees on the left of the image running north/south 
reflects the location of the spring branch. This is N 35.41762 X W -87.00607. I 
have not been here and my position is this is the first place I would look in 
attempting to locate this cemetery.<br/>

This map reveals the location of the Grigg place in that is has a hollow named
after the Grigg family. Chances are the cemetery can be found along that hollow
where spans the Adams Fork of the east fork of Fountain Creek known by that name
only in historical documents. The cemetery is most likely back against the
Elkridge on a ledge somewhere. I would say a good guess is between the
"Y" in the stream where the two branches come together.  I say
this because there probably is a large spring spewing fresh cold water from the
side of a bluff/hill that forms one of the two branches in the Y shape. This
could have yielded a source of water for the Grigg Family in early times and
means they would have built the house nearby. This was a survival trait of early
settlers in Maury County's Hills. [Commentary by WA

This 1878 historical map shows the P. H. Griggs
place near the Giles County Line. It is slightly highlighted in yellow
above. <br/>

This map shows the Adams Branch of the East fork of Fountain Creek (not so
called here) where the Grigg Hollow spans.
