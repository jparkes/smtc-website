This map shows the old incorrect and also the corrected coordinates of the Matthews Cemetery. For
the longest I could not locate this cemetery because the coordinates were about
1/4 of an mile in error. The Red check in the center of the map is incorrect
with the larger red check in the bottom of the map shows the corrected place.
The nearby black dot showing as a house is no longer there. A house with log
construction is now in the place of this structure further to the east more away
from road. Trees obscure ones view of this cemetery from the road except the house can be made out. The
house &amp; Land was for sale when I visited the cemetery.</br>

To find Matthews Cemetery go south from Columbia on Campbellsville Pike about 8
miles and continue on south about 1 mile past the junction of Southport Road and
Campbellsville Pike (the road you are traveling on). Turn left into a log house
driveway (with permission) and the cemetery is to the right and back of the
house, but also to the right and back of a small outbuilding. At the driveway
there is a board fence with a gate to negotiate. It is inside an old iron fence
that is failing. The Cemetery is actually about 50 yards southeast of the house
under a Pine &amp; Cedar Thicket ignoring other structures.</br>

</i>This Aerial Map shows the Log House and location of the Matthews Cemetery in
the clump of Pine &amp; Cedars. The house as pointed out is difficult to make
out in this image, but as you can see there are trees between you and the house
if you are on the on Highway 245.</br>

Maps from: Topozone, MS streets &amp; Trips ver. 2004 &amp; MS Bing, all

Visited there 20 Feb 2010 after having the location pointed out to me by a kind
contributor who noticed this cemetery missing from the Cemetery web site.</i></b></p>
