SHARP, William R. (Roberds), (20 Dec) 1815 - (3 Oct) 1862.&nbsp; (son of William
Roberds &amp; Isabella Roberts Sharp.) 2225</br>
SHARP, Sarah McGuire, died 1890. (wife of William Roberds Sharp; dau. of Thomas
&amp; Ann T. Lee McGuire: note: d.d. 1890 is positioned in the normal place of a
death date, not the original stone.) 2226</br>
<i>The stone for Sarah was evidently placed in this
cemetery after Mr Fred Hawkins visited and documented this cemetery in 1986.
Sarah McGuire Sharp is the wife of William Roberds Sharp. This couple
evidently were the original settlers in this area whereby this cemetery was
founded. It is known the Sharps were buried in unmarked graves here and
lived just a short distance from this cemetery.</br>

County Tennessee Cemeteries&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
