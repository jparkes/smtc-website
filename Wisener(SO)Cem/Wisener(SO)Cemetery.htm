*WISNER, Abner R., </b>married, born 16 May 1855, died 31 May 1923; burial in
the family cemetery; son Sam O. &amp; Mary R. Brooks Wisner.</p>
<p><b>*</b>From death records compiled by
Fred Hawkins. No memorial was found in this cemetery
during 1987 or 2009.<b></br>
</b><b></br>
</b>The two stone I found needed to be cut out from the brush. There
was not a hint of any memorials if one peeked over the fence into the cemetery
due to dense briars &amp; brush. Strong arms and a pair of loping shears works
wonders in 30 minutes of cutting and mashing down thickets. Of course it is
impossible in these circumstances to make a credible record of the cemetery,
because the ground needs to be clean enough for grave analysis to draw the
appropriate conclusions so we defer that to the future.</br>
Among the brush a row of daffodils bloomed profusely. These were probably
planted there many years ago by a living member of the Wisener family and bloom
forth every spring time to announce&nbsp; their colorful display. [WA 24 Mar
