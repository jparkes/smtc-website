(Monsanto Road) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</font>
</b></font><b><font size="2" color="#663300">CUMBERLAND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AT
CONCORD</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#663300">Concord Cumberland Presbyterian Church was
located seven miles from Columbia on land presently owned by Monsanto Chemical
Company.<br>
<br>
Nothing remains today to mark this hallowed spot except a cemetery (Concord).
According to an article in THE Nashville Tennessean, March 28, 1948, the church
was destroyed by a tornado.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#663300">The Concord congregation was organized about
1830 after camp meetings were held in the area. This group of worshippers was
led by the famous Reverend James Brown Porter who began to hold regular meetings
at Concord. The land calls locate this church as being on the west side of Green
Lick Creek.<br>
In 1831 William Jennings deeded to trustees William J. Jennings, Willian B.
Butler, Nathaniel Young and Peter Joyce one acre of land, &quot;for a house for
the Public worship of the living God.&quot; (Deed Book 0, Vol. 1, p. 463, 17
June 1831). At this time there may have already been a building of some kind for
public worship since the land calls mentioned &quot;Concord meetinghouse.&quot;<br>
Names of some of the earliest members of this church were Gray, Dooley, Joyce,
Baird and Hill. Early pastors included George W. Mitchell, Elishu Kirkpatrick,
T. Jeff Dixon, and J. N. Edmiston. Later ministers were Robert Whitaker, Sam
Polk, J. Tyler, Andrew Baker &amp; W. A. Provine.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#663300">In 1868 a new church was built. There was a
strong membership here at that time. During the middle years Ashley Hill, E. P.
Parsons and </font><font color="#663300"><font size="2">J. W. Trousdale were
Ruling Elders.</font></font><font size="2" color="#663300"> The Rev. R. F.
Jennings (1848-1876), a member of Concord Church was ordained to the ministry in
1872 by Richland Presbytery.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#663300">The earliest marked grave in the cemetery at
Concord is that of a child, Nellie Gray, who died December 12, 1842. Two men who
gave their lives to the Confederate cause have monuments here William H. Moore
who died a prisoner of war in Chicago and J. B. Applewhite, Jr. who died March
8, 1863.</font></p>
