<div>PROMINENT WOMAN PASSES TO BEYOND</div>
<div>MRS FANNIE ESTES DIES FROM HEART FAILURE MONDAY NIGHT.</div>
<div>(Tuesday's Daily)</div>
<div>Mrs. Fannie Estes, widow of the late J. D. Estes, died at her home near Mt. 
Pleasant at 10:30 o'clock on Monday night.  She was sixty-four years of age 
and her death was occasioned by heart failure.  She was a daughter of the 
late Capt. John N. Alexander.  Mrs. Estes belonged to one of the most 
prominent families of the county, and was a woman of much personal charm.  
She was a devoted and conscientious member of the Methodist church for many 
years of her life.  Her friends were very numerous, and she was well and 
favorably known over the county.  She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. 
R. H. Jennings, of Franklin, Mrs. Harry Hill, of Mt. Pleasant, and Mrs. W. K. 
Dunnavant, of California, and two sons, Wilbur and Russell Estes.  One 
brother, W. H. Alexander, of Lynnville, and three sisters, Mrs. S. J. Thomas, 
Misses Johnnie and Nolie Alexander, are also left behind.  The funeral will 
be held Wednesday morning at the Methodist church in Mt. Pleasant at 10 o'clock, 
conducted by Rev. J. W. Pearson.  Interment will take place at the Estes 
burial ground near Sunnyside.  Oakes &amp; Nichols in charge.</div>
