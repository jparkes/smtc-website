MRS. FANNIE ESTES DIES FROM HEART FAILURE MONDAY NIGHT. (Tuesday's Daily)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Fannie Estes, widow of the late J. D. Estes, died at her home near Mt.
Pleasant at 10:30 o'clock on Monday night. She was sixty-four years of age and
her death was occasioned by heart failure. She was a daughter of the late Capt.
John N. Alexander. Mrs. Estes belonged to one of the most prominent families of
the county, and was a woman of much personal charm. She was a devoted and
conscientious member of the Methodist church for many years of her life. Her
friends were very numerous, and she was well and favorably known over the
county. She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. R. H. Jennings, of Franklin,
Mrs. Harry Hill, of Mt. Pleasant, and Mrs. W. K. Dunnavant, of California, and
two sons, Wilbur and Russell Estes. One brother, W. H. Alexander, of Lynnville,
and three sisters, Mrs. S. J. Thomas, Misses Johnnie and Nolie Alexander, are
also left behind. The funeral will be held Wednesday morning at the Methodist
church in Mt. Pleasant at 10 o'clock, conducted by Rev. J. W. Pearson. Interment
will take place at the Estes burial ground near Sunnyside. Oakes &amp; Nichols
in charge.<br>
