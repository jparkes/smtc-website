<p><b>WEST, John S.</b>, 1798

<b>WEST, Susannah</b>, 8 May 1798 - 1885</br>
<b>WEST, T. P.,</b> birth date unknown - 9 Aug 1914.</br>

<b>According to Mr Fred Hawkins' survey there are five box tombs, with two of them 
being inscribed. Three others exist but are broken and evidently unreadable. There are 
enough assets there to provide a great opportunity to find the cemetery. 
Especially in winter months.</b></br>
