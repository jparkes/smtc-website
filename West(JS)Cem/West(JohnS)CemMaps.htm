Go north on Theta Pike, Pass Darks Mill 
Road and go about .3 mile and notice a fork in the road. After permission to 
cross thru the locked gate, the right fork goes 
only a short distance and is superficial. Take the left fork and go about .1 (1 
tenth of a mile) notice on the left an entrance to an unimproved (farm or old home?) road 
veering off left.<br>
Take that if you can drive on it. If not walk along it for 3 tenths of a mile to 
the end of it and there is either a house and barn there or an old house place 
and barn long gone. Either way you are at the closest point to the Cemetery 
except for the high hill on your left. Cross the small stream on your left 
someway and begin the climb up the hill. Climb up 80 feet (you will not know how 
high 80 feet is so climb the hill straight up along its slope to the highest 
point. That direction is 
West and to the south. After you reach the highest point turn northwest and 
follow the ridge remaining level. Do not climb any more as you are on the same 
level as the cemetery give or take 20 feet.
After you walk along the ridge northwest for 300 yards, you will face southwest 
(Turn right 90 degrees) pointing directly to the cemetery. Walk another .2 
tenths or 300 yards in that direction and veer slightly to the left side of the 
slope. The cemetery will be on that plateau.<br>

Above is a labeled and highlighted a path to the cemetery. I do not 
guarantee this will work without more modifications but at least it is a start, 
because topography is never perfect. 
There are many houses in the area now related to growth since 1987. Certainly the hills and Theta Road have not changed. 
However fences and lack of permission will need to be addressed.<br>

With this photo view
one can actually see looking west from Theta Pike the distant hill tops where 
the cemetery should be located.<br>

Dear Wayne,<br>
<br>
I am planning a trip to Maury Co the week of March 20-24. Two distant cousins 
and I are meeting to go through the cemeteries.
Can you tell me where the John S. West Cemetery is? He is my 4th great 
grandfather. I found the coordinates but don't have a working GPS. I 
need driving directions. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="#008000">Thanks so much for your 
help you can provide. <br>

One cannot drive to the West Cemetery according to the URL for the TOPO map 
unless someone has built a house near there and their entrance lane is available 
for use.<br>
<br>
Mr. Fred Hawkins says during 1987: Go north on Theta Pike, Pass Darks Mill Road 
and go another 1/4 mile further. (so far so good, you are still in your car). 
Enter the small lane on the left that follows a small stream. (also shown on 
topography maps as a dotted (field) road, but may not be visible today). About 1,000 feet 
further, a farm trail crosses the stream. (This trail may now be hard to find). 
The cemetery is in the woodlands on top of the high hill (or ridge in this case. This is generally very 
hard to find with small abandoned cemeteries, but much easier in the winter 
months).
The above directions Mr. Fred offers are very vague, as this map indicates, 
because the high hill is meandering in size and shape. It is not a cone shaped 
hill, but see the mapping instructions above I have provided to better serve 
you. However don't ignore the land owner.<br>
