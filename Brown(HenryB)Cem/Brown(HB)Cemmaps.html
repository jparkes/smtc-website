This Aerial view shows the various roads nearby and the route to the cemetery.
To get there:</br>
</b><b>In the western area of Maury County
&amp; on the west side of I-65 and visible in the winter time from I-65. </br>
From Kedron Go east 1 miles and turn left or north on Joe Peay Cemetery Road. Go
1/4 mile and turn right into the road to the cemetery. Continue as this road bends
left then back right and on around to the cemetery on your right. This leg of
Joe Peay Cemetery road does not cross I-65.</br>

<b>This is a little
clearer map using a long yellow arrow to point the cemetery out. It is located
in the little clearing visible as a tiny lighter green square on this map.</br>
