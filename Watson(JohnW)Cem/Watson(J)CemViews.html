This view shows up close the grounds of the cemetery where we can see in the
lower right of the photo a fieldstone marking a grave. It is actually the first
grave in the second row. We are looking southwest.<br/>

This view shows up close the grounds of the cemetery. We can see in the lower
right, along the second row, two other fieldstones marking graves. These are
actually the south most graves in the east row. We are looking north. We have
made an effort to hide the private assets of the surrounding homes &amp; assets
by cropping the photos. Thanks for your patience there.  <a href="../AndrewsCemetery/Andrews03.html"><br/>
