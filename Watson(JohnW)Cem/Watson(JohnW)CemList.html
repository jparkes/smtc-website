<p align="center"><b>WATSON,
(JOHN W.) CEMETERY, (Fred white Rd), MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<br/>
</b>
From Columbia follow Hwy 50 several miles and turn north (left) onto Fred white
Road before it goes under I-65. Go 1 3/4 miles north and look right at a trailer
house 200 yards off the road. The cemetery is 50 yards in back of that home
under the trees.<a href="WatsonCemMaps.html"><br/>

</b>Death records:
<br/>
*WATSON, William W., "64, died Monday; son of late John Watson; wife &amp; 3
sons survive; buried in family cemetery." (Maury Democrat, 3 May 1928.)</p>
<p>*Possibly buried here as Mr. Fred Hawkins indicated in 1987.
Mr. Fred Hawkins offered no final evidence that William W. Watson was of this
same Watson family. In fact there is another Watson family buried in the
Watson-Pinkston Cemetery just a mere 2 miles south of this place and that is
another possibility. [WA, 23 Jan 2009]

</p>

<p>There were several fieldstones, still in
place &amp; standing on edge embedded into the soil, marking graves both within
the grave areas of the Watson family.  One or two of them were in the
outlying areas. <br/>
<br/>
Except for the condition of the John W. Watson memorial this little family
cemetery is in remarkably good condition to have been abused in the past. Many
of the fieldstones that mark graves are still in place. I commend the parents of
the children of the neighborhood for teaching the children to respect these
graves and monuments.<br/>
