From Columbia follow Hwy 50 several miles and turn north (left) onto Fred white
Road before it goes under I-65. Go 1 3/4 miles north and look east (right) at a trailer
house 200 yards off the road. The cemetery is 50 yards in back of that home under
trees.&nbsp;The family living there have a large dog so be careful. There&nbsp;was
a tense moment getting permission, and keeping the dog friendly, but all was well in
the end. Mr. Fred Hawkins mentioned in 1987 the cemetery was in the middle of a junk
yard. That is no longer so.</br>
