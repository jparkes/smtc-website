<p><b>Two of the stones in this cemetery are
surrounded by a wrought iron fence big enough for several graves.</br>
This cemetery is badly neglected and overgrown with trees, bushes and vines.
15-20 graves, marked with fieldstones were found on east side of cemetery and
are thought to be graves of slaves. [Mr. Fred Hawkins 1986.]</br>
Still a big problem in 2008, I found this cemetery so overgrown that it was near
impossible to find all of the stones without clearing the place - which would 
take many hours. One could
barely see the ground for the brush and debris from fallen trees and new growth.
That along with fallen and lost stones is the reason I missed some of
the stones evidently found by past researchers. Each stone that I found needed a
clearing of the debris &amp; brush to get to, &amp; read it, and make a photograph. This cemetery
takes first place for being the most overgrown cemetery I have visited this
year. My Brush whacker came in handy as I cut a path to/thru the cemetery.
However, in 96 degree heat that approach had to be abandoned. My
recommendation; do not visit this cemetery in the summer as I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
