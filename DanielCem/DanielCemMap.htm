2008 Instructions: Change of ownership. Place no longer belongs to Mrs. C. U.
Barker. Also turn south into the first white gravel lane back from I-65, about 500 yards, on the west side of
I</font>nterstate <font face="Comic Sans MS">65, exit 46. The cemetery (after gaining permission) will be on your left
down the tree</font> line going eastward about 200 yards just inside the tree
line. You could also follow the north side of the fence line eastward for the 200
yards the cemetery from the driveway. The cemetery then was a dense thicket and 
getting there on the north side of the fence is also a briar thicket.</font><i><font color="#800000" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><br>
