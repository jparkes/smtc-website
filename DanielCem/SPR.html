</p>

<p>Very few realize the hardships that were
endured by preachers of the gospel a hundred years ago. There were two very
formidable enemies, the world and religious denominations. These enemies are
found today in many communities, but they are not so prejudiced and bitter in
their persecutions as they were in the earlier days of the Restoration Movement.
It was unpopular to proclaim &quot;the ancient order.&quot; Oftentimes the one
who proclaimed the gospel had to suffer persecution. Those who preached the
gospel at that time came out of some well-established denomination. When one
came out of a denomination and began preaching the gospel, he lost the
friendship of all his acquaintances and incurred the enmity of the denomination
whence he came.</p>
<p>Joshua Kennerly Speer was born in 1794, in
Yadkin County, North Carolina. He was the son of Aaron Speer; his mother's name
was &quot;Elizabeth.&quot; He was reared in the Baptist faith. His parents were
what they then called &quot;Old Baptists,&quot; or Primitive Baptists. Joshua K.
Speer accepted the teaching of his father, but could not understand the theories
concerning predestination and election. He searched for light from all whom he
thought were able to give him help. He held long and interested interviews with
the prominent Baptist preachers of his faith. They tried to satisfy his mind,
but were unable to do so. He doubted the whole system of the Baptist faith. Some
of his preachers told him that his &quot;doubts&quot; were strong evidence that
he was one of the elect. However, this did not remove the difficulty from his
mind.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-four he came to Tennessee
and located in Williamson County not far from Franklin. This put him in new
environments. He thought that be might find comfort and further instruction with
respect to his religious life. By nature he was pious and humble. He wanted to
do the will of God, but did not know how to begin it. He had never read the
Bible. It did riot occur to; him to read the Bible for instruction. He began
reading the New Testament, and soon he saw the light. He was baptized by Elder
J. J. Trott. However, he identified himself with the Baptist Church of his
community. It did not occur to him that he could be a Christian, without
belonging to some of the denominations. He knew that they were wrong, that they
taught much error, but he attributed this to the frailty of man.</p>
<p>On the fourth Lord's Day in November, 1823, he
began to preach. He was identified with the Baptists that time. He was not
trying to preach what the Baptists believed, but what little he knew of the
Bible. He wanted to honor God and teach his truth, but he had learned very
little of it at that time. He became a reader of the Christian Baptist,
published by Alexander Campbell, and this led him to preach with more clearness
the truth as revealed in the New Testament. It was difficult for him to banish
from his thoughts the confusion of religious error that he had learned. He
continued to preach, and was among the first in the State of Tennessee to come
from the Baptists and preach &quot;the ancient order of things.&quot; He set his
heart to the task of teaching his neighbors and all who would listen to him the
will of God. He was a successful preacher and had a wonderful influence over his
hearers. He entered the evangelistic field and preached in Northern Alabama and
Middle Tennessee wherever opportunity was offered him.</p>
<p>He was positive in nature and preached the
gospel in a direct way. There was no misunderstanding him. He had but little
education from books, but he became quite familiar with the teachings of the
Bible and had the gift of expressing himself with clearness and force. He had
sympathy for those in error, and, with his power of presenting the truth with
clearness and his power of exhortation, he won many to Christ. In 1848 we find
him teaching clearly the duty of members of the church. He wrote to the editor
of the Christian Magazine and said: &quot;For three months I have been trying to
'bring about a better state of things in the churches where I have labored, by
teaching the disciples what the Scriptures, demand them to do and what they
forbid their doing, as members of Christ's body.&quot; He further says: &quot;As
the course most likely to insure success in this, I have laid great stress on
personal and family culture. I am perfectly convinced, that, if a member of the,
church will not try to add to 'his faith all that is commanded (see 2 Pet. 1:
5-7), he should be removed from the community. Again, if a member who is at the
head of the family will not read (if he can read) to, and offer prayer to God
in, his family, he should be excluded.&quot; This shows that Brother Speer saw
the need of teaching the word of God in the family.</p>
<p>In 1850 we find him Preaching at Cathey's
Creek, Dunlap, Liberty, and Mount Horeb. In giving a report of his work for
1849, he gives the number of additions to these churches, which amount is above
three hundred. He held a meeting at Totty's Bend and baptized eighteen in July
of that year. In August of the same year he held a meeting at Lynnville, Tenn.,
and baptized twenty-nine. He preached a week at Weakley's Creek and baptized
fifteen. He held a meeting at Lasea in 1849 and baptized fifty. In 1850 we find
him doing evangelistic work in Giles and Lawrence counties. In these counties he
established many congregations. We find him also preaching in Wayne, Lewis,
Maury, Hickman, and Lincoln counties. He established churches in all of these
counties that year. In 1.852 we find a record of his work published in the
Christian Magazine. In his report he says: &quot;I bad the good fortune to plant
a church at Williamsport, Maury County, Tennessee, last year [18511, numbering
thirty-eight members. Several have been added to this congregation this year
[1852].&quot; There are very few congregations in Maury County that have not
felt the influence of Brother Speer.</p>
<p>In 1855 we find him living in Rutherford
County. He held a meeting for Rock Springs Church, in that county, beginning on
July 13, 1855, and continuing one week, in which there were forty additions to
the church. In making his report to the Gospel Advocate he says- &quot;Let us
thank God and take courage.&quot; He preached monthly for the Rock Springs
Church during the year 1855, and there were fifty-three additions to the church
that year. On December 27, 1855, he reported to the Gospel Advocate that he had
just closed a meeting at Brawley's Fork (old Brother Calvin Curlee's earthly
home) with seventeen additions. He also reported that he had fifteen additions
at Cripple Creek, in Cannon County, and fifteen at Millersburg, Rutherford
County. He closes his report to the Gospel Advocate as follows: &quot;As ever,
your brother in the best of all labors on earth, J. K. Speer.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1856 he visited his old home in Yadkin
County, North Carolina. He bad a brother living there at Yadkin Institute. He
preached there and baptized fourteen and planted a church there. He says- that
he preached &quot;three times in the meetinghouse in Rockford, and three times
in the courthouse in Yadkinville, to very large congregations who seemed to be
anxious to learn the gospel plan of salvation more perfectly. Never did I see a
people more ripe for reformation than they are at this time in North Carolina. I
believe we ought to send one or more to preach the gospel there.&quot; This
report was made to the Gospel Advocate in 1856. His meeting at Yadkin Institute
was held in the early spring of that year. Again we find him visiting Yadkin
Institute in September of the same year. In making his report of this visit to
the Gospel Advocate, he says: &quot;I am happy to say that 1 found the disciples
here 'walking in truth.' They have met every Lord's Day since they first became
a congregation last spring. I have added nine to their number since my
arrival.&quot; A later report shows that nineteen were added to the church and
that he preached at five other places in the State. He reported that he had
preached at Dobson, Surry County, North Carolina, and found there two
ministers---one a Baptist, the other a Methodist---&quot;both of high standing
in their respective churches, and of fair abilities both natural and acquired.
After hearing me three times the Baptist minister most freely gave up his
humanisms for the truth, and after hearing four more discourses the Methodist
made the good confession and was immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for the
remission of sins; with these I gained fourteen others, thus planting a church
in Dobson of sixteen members, with two of as good preachers as are to be found
in that region. Thus you see I gained thirty-five in all.&quot;</p>
<p>We find Joshua K. Speer in 1857 living at
Lavergne, Tenn., and a member of the board of trustees of Franklin College. This
shows that he was in high standing and in great favor with Tolbert Fanning. He
was interested in the education of the young people of his country. He was
especially interested in preparing young men to preach the gospel. In giving his
report for the year 1857 in the Gospel Advocate, we find him at McMinnville,
Tenn., in a week's meeting, in which there were twenty additions to the church.
That year he preached at Lynnville six days, with seven additions. He reports
holding a meeting at New Hermon, where he labored with Brother David Lipscomb in
a meeting and baptized nine. He was associated with Dr. T. W. Brents in a
meeting at Liberty, with twenty-five additions. At Ebenezer he joined Brother D.
Lipscomb and Brother Tolbert Fanning in a pleasant meeting, with twelve
additions. This year he had one hundred and thirteen additions to the
congregation at Rock Spring, in Rutherford County. No preacher labored more
abundantly than did Brother Speer. This year he lived at New Hermon, in Bedford
County, Tennessee. This congregation is one of the oldest congregations in the
State.</p>
<p>Brother Speer died at his home at New Hermon,
May 27,1858. A recent visit to his tomb in the little cemetery near the New
Hermon church house revealed that, according to the record on the tombstone, he
died in 1859. This is an error, evidently placed on the stone some years after
his death. The Gospel Advocate, bound volume of 1858, page 256, gives a report
of his death. The Millennial Harbinger of 1858, page 540, gives a brief report
of his death. Both the Gospel Advocate and Millennial Harbinger of 1858 report
his death. These evidently record the date of his death correctly; hence, the
date on the tombstone is an error. Brother Speer was married twice and has many
descendants now living.<b><span style="color: navy"></br>
