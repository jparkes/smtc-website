SEALY, Laura F. Sealy, 1875 - 1930.</br>
<i>This stone was uncovered from the debris. We are supposed to
bury our dead not their memorials.</br>
I suppose this is the second stone for Laura D. Sealy since the death dates are
the same and this is close enough to be her footstone to be so even though it
was difficult to decipher that due to the thick brush.</i></br>
