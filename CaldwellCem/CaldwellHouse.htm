The Caldwell house as of 1900. Does not stand today. It was near this graveyard
between here and Kedron Pike.<br>
The famous Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forest made his headquarters here
for a time during the Civil War. Even today military tacticians study the
movements of this general who struck and eluded the overwhelming force of the
northern troops to out man and out gun, and send them packing many times when it
should normally have gone the other way. <br>
