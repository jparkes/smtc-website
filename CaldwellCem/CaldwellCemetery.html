Rippavilla Plantation&quot;. Is a noteworthy visit.</p>
<p align="center"><i>This Caldwell family or at
least their relatives mixed with the Crockett Family of the famous pioneer Davy
Crockett in East Tennessee. Davy eventually came thru middle Tennessee and so
other Crockett &amp; Caldwell pioneers also came west into Middle Tennessee. My
ancestor Robert Crockett who settled in Giles County Tennessee and died there
and is interred in the Elkridge Cemetery was one of those, but it is believed he
came thru South&nbsp; Carolina. Robert Crockett inherited land from brother
David Crockett (not Davy, who I believe was a nephew) of Bibb County Ga. It is
thought Robert &amp; David migrated to Ga. Robert then went on to Giles County,
Tn.&nbsp; and David became a land trader and eventually died in Ga..</br>
