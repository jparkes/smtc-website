<p>This cemetery has been restored by the Sons of the Confederate Veterans. It
was still a work in progress when I went there during November 29, 2005.</p>
<p>Sarah Dick Todd was the only sister of three Irishmen brothers who were
wholesale merchants of Louisville and New Orleans.&nbsp; One of the three
brothers, James Dick, on a trip to Italy, saw a beautiful villa that he decided
to duplicate just south of Columbia. This he did in 1837 and presented it to his
sister, Sarah. This is the beautiful Elm Springs house that can still be admired
as one travels out of Columbia on the Mooresville Pike. At the time she received
the estate from her brother, Sarah Dick was already married to Christopher
Todd, a Virginia native, who was relatively wealthy in his own right. When her
brother James died in 1849, Sarah inherited much of his wealth. The Todds'
were parents of one son James who died in 1843 and was the first person buried
in this cemetery. However James had three sisters and one of the daughters,
Susan, married Colonel Abe M. Looney. Sarah preceded Christopher Todd in death,
passing away in 1853. Mr. Todd passed away during 1868 and the Looney family
then inherited Elm Springs.</p>
