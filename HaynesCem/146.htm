BALDRIDGE, John, 28 Sep 1754 - 17 Oct 1823. AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR SOLDIER.
Inscription reads: &quot;In memory of JOHN BALDRIDGE who was born 28 sep. 1754
&amp; died in the 70th year of his age on Oct 17th 1823.&quot;<br>
BALDRIDGE, Isabella Luckey, (b. 27 Feb 1761, d. after 1843 when she requested a
soldier's pension.) A large flat slab sits beside the memorial of John. It
appears not to be inscribed.)<br>
JOHN BALDRIDGE, born on 28 Sep 1754 in Iredell Co., N. C., is one of Maury
County's better documented veterans of the Revolutionary War. He served as a
Captain over an extended period from about 1778 to 1783. He was in some of the
most important engagements fought by the N. C. militia and evidently was a
&quot;&quot;brave and skillful officer&quot;&quot; as his wife's pension
application states. He and Isabella Luckey were married on 21 Aug 1780 and
eleven children were added&quot; to them over the succeeding 25 years. They made
their home in Lincoln Co., N. C. until 1797 when they moved to Davidson Co.,
Tenn. In 1813 they settled in Maury Co. Father John Baldridge died on 17 Oct
1823 and was possibly the first person buried in this graveyard. His family was
very proud and resisted applying for a government pension until 1843 when the
mother was a very old lady.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;A large slab extends out to the east and covers John's grave. His
wife's memorial is installed next to our right in the same way but without the
memorial inscriptive stone.&nbsp;<br>
 Some researchers have this name as John B. Baldridge.
While that might be so I don't see it here. I see the period after the capital B
as a preceding anchor for the capital &quot;A&quot; in BALDRIDGE and not
&quot;B.&quot;. Besides, that would suggest the name to be &quot;John B.
Aldridge&quot;. I am going on the assumption that historians in the past have proven the
surname as Baldridge.&nbsp;<br>
It was common for the head of the household to be the only one to receive an
inscribed memorial when memorial stones were first introduced to the pioneers in
the early 1800s in the south. It was probably related to the availability and expensive nature of inscribed
memorials at the time.<br>
