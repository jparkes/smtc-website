Unknown grave, outlined with lime stones in the older section of the cemetery
near the Baldridge graves. There is a large open area in the center of the
graveyard that is open with either unmarked graves or as Mr. Fred believes there
may be bedrock here that makes it unusable for graves. Given the number of
unaccounted for ancestors I rather believe it is for unmarked graves, but only
archeological research would determine that and no one is interested in
that.&nbsp;
