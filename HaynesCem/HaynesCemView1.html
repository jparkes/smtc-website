This view of the Haynes
Cemetery looks northwest from the southeast area of the cemetery. The area
clustered around the center of the cemetery in the midst of the large cedars
tends to be the oldest with growth in the easterly and westerly direction from
there.</br>

</i>Looking east from close to the eastern edge of the cemetery finds this view.
The cemetery was surveyed and photographed starting on the western side
progressing eastward. However the last part surveyed was in the new area on
the&nbsp; western side across the cemetery entrance road.</br>

</i></b>This photo in the center of the cemetery shows a large open area where
the ground may not be suitable for graves due to large boulders or it may
contain the remains of many interments without headstones.
It is in the oldest part of the cemetery and we are looking northwest.&nbsp;<i><b>

</i>We get this view by panning the camera back to the east from the SE center
of the cemetery. The cemetery road circles the cemetery.<i></br>
