Joseph Haynes was born 15 Oct 1749. He enlisted in a company of militia in his
native county of Rowan in North Carolina. &quot;when the call for troops went
out in 1775. He first served under Captain Dixon. He served with this unit for
numerous tours of duty throughout the Revolution and was in the Battles of
Ramsour's Mill and Cowan's Ford. It is likely that he was a neighbor and
companion of John Baldridge since they were from same area, served in the same
engagements and immigrated to the same locality in Maury County Tennessee. His
namesake has been placed on this cemetery bearing the name of this hero.</font></b></p>

<p><b>Obituary Notice of Joseph Haynes, written
by Melvin Andrews Haynes, Banner of Peace and Cumberland Presbyterian Advocate,
Vol 4 #9, Friday, June 20, 1845.</br>
Joseph Haynes, Sen'r DIED - On the 3rd June, 1845 at his residence on Silver
Creek, Maury county, Tenn., JOSEPH HAYNES, Senior, in the 90th year of his age.</b></font></p>
<p><b>He was born in Dauphin county, Penn., in
the year 1749, but was raised in the Province of North Carolina, to which his
father emigrated in 1752. He was one of the earliest advocates of independence,
and although he did not participate in the Mecklenburg Declaration, he warmly
approved and supported it. He was actively engaged, throughout almost the whole
of the seven years' war, in the partisan warfare which was waged in the
Carolinas, first under one partisan leader, and then another. He was at the
battle of the Cowpens, and a few days afterwards, formed a part of Gen.
Davidson's army, when that brave General lost his life, in opposing the passage
of the British, at Cowans's Ford, on the Catawba. His two younger brothers were
also there, and the gallant Capt. James Scott who fell in that battle, was his
brother-in-law.</b></font></p>
<p><b>Soon after the retreat of the republican
army, and after they had made their last stand at Tarrant's house, he was met by
his sister, who had threaded her way through by-paths for forty miles, having
eluded the marauding parties, which were scattered through the country, to bear
him the painful intelligence, that his farm had been laid waste, his house
pillaged, his property destroyed or carried off, and his aged and sick father
carried off to the British army by a party of Col. Tarleton's flying dragoons.
His sons left the republican army, and started on the trail of Tarleton's men,
and after several days pursuit, they found their father left for dead on the
road-side, watched by a wounded republican soldier, who had generously stopped
to watch over the dying old man, at the peril of death to himself. They bore him
to his home, so lately the scene of British outrage, where he did not long
survive the cruelty of his inhuman captors. His sons, however, lived to see and
to aid in many of the glorious battles, in which Tarleton, and Ferguson and
Conwallis were soon after so signally defeated in the Carolinas. He had many
kinsmen; and it was his boast, that of them all, there was not one, who was able
to bear a musket, who did not fight under the republican flag. Two of his
kinsmen formed a part of the northern army - one of whom fell at Bunker-Hill,
and the other lost an eye, in a battle soon after. There was scarcely a battle fought
in the southern Provinces, in which some one of his family did not participate,
nor was there one of them, whose home was not given up to pillage, and to
plunder. Thought elder than all his kinsmen, who survived the Revolution, he
outlived them all.</b></font></p>
<p><b>He was one of the first &quot;who broke the
cane, and hunted the buffalo&quot; in the valley of Duck River. He was a brave
soldier - an ardent patriot, and for near half a century an humble and devout
member of the Cumberland Presbyterian church; and he lived to see several of his
descendants and relatives useful and worthy ministers of the same church.</b></font></p>
<p><b>Until within a short time before his death,
he was able to walk and ride as usual; and though advanced beyond the age
usually allotted to man's existence, he never lost the vigor of intellect, nor
the manliness of carriage, which characterized his earlier years.</b></font></p>
<p><b>Few men have lived so long and worthly; and
it cannot but be a source of gratification to his numerous family and relatives,
that he had lived, a devoted and humble Christian.</b></font></p>
<p><b>He had passed through a long pilgrimage,
had seen much sorrow and been visited by many trying dispensations of
providence; yet he triumphed over them, all, over exhibiting an example of
dignified and patient submission to whatever visitations of misfortune might befall
him: and well might he have said, in view of the events of his own life,
&quot;The way was long, my children, long and rough. But he that creeps from
cradle down to grave, Unskilled, save in the velvet walks of fortune, Hath
missed the discipline of noble hearts.&quot; M. A. H.</br>
