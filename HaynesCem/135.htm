ROBERTS, James H., 12 Feb 1917 - 31 Dec 2001.<br>
ROBERTS, Annie Pearl, 4 May 1921 - 29 Oct 1984, (wife of James H. Roberts.)<br>
<i><br>
This couple's memorial theme &quot;Precious Memories&quot;&nbsp; pleasantly tell
each of us that we decide how and whether when we grow old and gray the memories
were pleasant or not. That is our call. If we lead a life of digression and self
gratification continually on the negative side we will then look back on life
and know the pitiful &amp; erroneous actions of our nature. The Roberts did the
memory assessment and realized it was pleasant and even worthy of being called
precious. Take steps today to make your life memories pleasant.<br>
