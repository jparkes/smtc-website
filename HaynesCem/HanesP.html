ts was recorded by Fred Hawkins in "Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries (1986) and 
Maurice Lightfoot in "They Passed This Way" (1963) his tombstone must have been 
moved as the above is now in Hanes Cemetery Hickman County, but whether the 
remains were removed is unknown. Since these monuments were added years later 
they may have never been placed at the head of his grave anyway. MB/CWA)</b><b><i><br/>
Photographed on 27 Dec 2006 by Wayne Austin. Update 16 Apr 2012: "In order to 
keep the history of the Haynes Cemetery Records intact, perhaps you should state 
that Peter Hanes' marker was recorded by Fred Hawkins in Haynes Cemetery Maury 
County Ref; Maury Co. TN. Cemeteries and "They passed this way" by Maurice 
Lightfoot.<br/>
It is thought that the remains were removed to Hanes Cemetery, Hickman County, 
Tennessee after these books were written. David Norwood CLAPBOARD3@aol.com</i></b></p>
