Gray:<br>
Wilson Dobbins' father was David Dobbins, who came to Maury County in 1807 with
a group of Presbyterian settlers from South Carolina, and his mother was
Catherine Gilchrist, daughter of Malcolm Gilchrist, another early settler. His
brother was Confederate General Archibald Dobbins who was born at Sandy Hook and
moved to the Brazilian jungle after the war was over out of protest. Dr. Wilson
Dobbins, had joined him, but he returned to the U.S. about 1870 disillusioned
with the Brazilian adventure. He said Brazil was impossible, the climate
terrible, and dependable labor non-existent. He had urged his brother Arch to
return, but the general remained, confident that he could make another fortune
in timber here.<br>
