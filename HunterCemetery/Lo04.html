LOHORN, Ann, born 21 Aug 1842. &quot;36th year of her age Consort of Wm. Lohorn;
daughter of James &amp; Dorothy Busby.&quot; I cannot vouch for the accuracy of
this inscription. Maybe it says: &quot;SACRED to the memory of Ann Lohorn
consort of Wm Lohorn, daughter of James &amp; Dorthy Busby, was born August 21
1842. died in the 36th year of her age&quot; Cannot confirm the birth date. It
may be a death date. [WA 5/17/06]</br>
