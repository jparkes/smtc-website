WRIGHT, Mary A., 24 Aug 1812 - 17 Feb 1893."She 
is . . ."<br/>
WRIGHT, Martha E., 23 Mar 1823 - 9 Dec 1886. "Gone Home" (Hunter Meetinghouse - 
on stone with Mary A. 1812-1893.)<br/>
There is another stone with the inscription Mary A. Wright. My archeological 
perspective is that years ago this stone top broke off and was lost for a time 
so the other stone was set to replace this one and they have the death date as 
19 Feb 1904. However it maybe that the other stone was set to correct the death 
date, but the latter is a more remote possibility. Also these two stones are not 
near each other. CWA.<br/>
