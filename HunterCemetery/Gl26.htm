&nbsp;GILCHRIST, ARCHIBALD,Tombstone Inscription as found by Nelda Stephenson, 5/30/06:
&quot;Sacred to the memory of Archibald Gilchrist born on June 8th 1791 &amp; died Jan
11th 1852 aged ____ years, 7 mo. &amp; 3 days&quot;. All records show that he was born
in 1794 but I believe that the inscription is 1791. I may be mistaken and the
number of years lived is not legible. Nelda Stephenson, June 24, 2006.<br>
