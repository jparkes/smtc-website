<p align="center"><b>1887</br>
July 12 - The most appalling occurrence we have ever heard of took place at the
Hunter Cemetery this evening. The people had met to bury a colored woman named
Terry and a shower of rain coming up, a number took shelter under a large Oak
tree; which was struck by lightening killing nine persons. Before that we have no
recollection of more than two being killed by a single bolt of lightening electricity;
others have been knocked down senseless, but recovered! It is a terrible warning
to many of us, who were not at the burial. We know not when to expect the grim messinger - 'In the midst of life, we are in death&quot;...Those killed at the
cemetery were: Rev. Burch, Mrs. Burch, Emanl. Orr, Mrs. Guthrie, Tom Rogers,
Hester Terry, Harriet Terry, Rose Terry and Inez Hanna.</br>
</br>
July 13 - They were all buried in one grave, except Mrs. Guthrie, near where
they fell.</br>
</br>
Mr. McClinchey never did say where they buried Mrs. Guthrie. Mr. McClinchey
lived in the Mt. Pleasant area. So, I presume this is Hunter Cemetery (black
section) at Mt. Pleasant. This location is 100 yards from the Hunter Cemetery
