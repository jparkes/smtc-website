According to &quot;Goodspeed's History of Maury County, p. 926, Thomas A. Harris, a 
widely known citizen of Mount Pleasant, was born in Halifax County, Vrginia June 
20, 1820. He was the second son of a family of three sons and three daughters 
born to Thomas F. and Ann L. (COBB) HARRIS, natives respectively of Powhattan 
Co., Va. and Granville Co., N.C. Our subject resided with his parents on the 
farm until 1846; in 1839 he was one of the escorts of Gen Samuel Houston from 
West Tennessee to the republic of Texas. In June of 1846 he enlisted in the 
Mexican War in Co. C, Tennessee Cavalry. He was first married to Miss Sarah H. 
Cooper of Maury County, and to them were born one son and one daughter: Millard 
F (deceased) and Anna L. Mrs. Harris died in October 1856 (note month does not

Elizabeth J. Stockard, who died October 8, 1868. For three months of the Civil 
War, Mr. Harris was second lieutenant of the State militia. He was a Whig 
previous to the war, but later became a Republican. He was in Washington when 
the news came of Robert E. Lee's surrender, and was in Ford's Theater at the 
time of the assassination of President Lincoln. He was an Odd Fellow and a 
member of the Episcopal Church. His juvenile career was somewhat checkered and 
romantic, with many incidents of pleasure and hardships in thirty states and 
under four governments. His life since the Mexican War has been devoted 
exclusively to his family duties in Maury County. </br>
