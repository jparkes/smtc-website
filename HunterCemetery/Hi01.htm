Published Friday, September 24, 1897<br>
<br>
A fighting affray occurred here at the depot on the evening of the 21st between 
Bud Phillips and Tom Hightower, which resulted in the killing of Hightower. They 
had some words in the morning, and met again late in the afternoon, and the 
quarrel came up again. Hightower was rushing on Phillips with a knife when shot 
him several times through the head and once through the body, causing instant 
death. Hightower leaves a wife and several children. He had been told that 
morning that if he did not stop drinking and attend to his own affairs, some one 
would kill him; he was an overbearing character. Mr. Phillips' friends regret 
the killing very much. Hightower was buried at Hunter's grave-yard. Phillips is 
still at large. <br>
