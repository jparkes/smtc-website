ground is parked after making a left turn into the cemetery, and in front of two
large piles of churt or dirt. My first thought is, fill in sunken spots (OH NO,
not without first marking the grave with a stone and making a historical record
that a grave was there! ).Beside the tall tree in the far background you might
catch a glimpse of the side of the Hunter Cemetery Sign. So I am looking toward
the west if the tombstones are facing the east, I believe that was the
directions they always faced. &quot;There was an old church here called Hunter
Meeting House at one time&quot;</b></font><br>

<b><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Above are a few
photos of the &quot;old Historic&quot; Hunter Cemetery. These stones are largely
characteristic of those of the 1800s. They are composed of various
levels of hardness of limestone compared to today's Granite. Granite is expected to
last thousands of years, but these are much softer stones some of which have fallen into
decay already. They will weather away in a few hundred years at the most perhaps
leaving us no
trail of who the inhabitants in this community were. In many cases these stones will be
the only remaining records we mortals have of
their having been here on this green earth. [WA 3/26/2005]<br>
