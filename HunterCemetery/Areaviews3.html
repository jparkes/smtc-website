<b>Looking north west panning further left.<br/>
Looks 
as if some half heated upkeep of the grounds is going on. Some mowing but not 
all. In fairness this section of the 
country has undergone the worst growing season for vegetation ever. That happens when 
there is not the normal drying spell that stunts vegetation. This last summer 
something green 
was growth all season long except for a short three week drought that was not long 
but instead extremely Hot, so hot it burned up the corn crops.<br/>
