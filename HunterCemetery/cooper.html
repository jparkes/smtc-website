the Mexican War, he became a 49er and joined his cousins, John Cooper (son of Jonathan) and Alexander 
Patton (son of Elizabeth); and his cousin's husband, Lewis S. Akin, and five other young me and went to 
California to seek fame and fortune. About four years after he returned to Mt. Pleasant, he married 
Caroline Kinzer, who was to become known as "Mrs. Capt Cooper" or "Aunt Callie". The gold fever had never 
left James C. Cooper and he wanted to see New Mexico again, so he left in the early fall of 1897 to join 
his nephew and stake a claim of his own. He was still healthy at sixty-one and felt he could withstand the 
trip. He became ill and died at a mining camp called Salinas Peak near Tularosa on Nov 11, 1897. He was 
buried there, but in 1906, his children decided to have his body returned from New Mexico to Mt. Pleasant 
and inter it beside his wife in Hunter's Cemetery. He was the beloved father of John Thomas Cooper, Albert 
Clark Cooper, James H. Cooper, William Duncan Cooper, George Lee Cooper, Robert "Bob" Cooper, Annie Byrd 
Cooper Burton, Callie Dora Cooper Chandler. Burial: Hunter Cemetery Mount Pleasant (Maury County) Maury
