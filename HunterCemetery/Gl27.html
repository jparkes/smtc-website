There
are three tops of gravestones listed in Hunter Cemetery which are presumed to be located in Hunter Cemetery,
Maury County, Tennessee. However, in reality they are located in Old Courtland
Cemetery, Courtland, Lawrence County, Alabama with the same inscriptions that
are presumed to be on the tombstones in Maury County, Tennessee. I (Nelda) have
scrubbed and washed the memorials then charcoaled them with charcoal chalk to
make them legible to prove these are the same stones previously listed in Maury
County Tennessee. I believe these to be the original tombstones of
our Gilchrist ancestors. This Malcolm and Catherine Gilchrist were the &quot;parents&quot;
of the Tennessee and North Alabama Gilchrist. I don't know how they got to Old
Courtland Cemetery. They are listed by John Purcell as being in the Hunter
cemetery in his book, LUMBER RIVER SCOTS&quot; published in 1942.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
MALCOLM GILCHRIST (Tombstone Inscription) Sacred to the memory of Malcolm
Gilchrist, Sr. who was the son of Angus Gilchrist was born in Cantire, Scotland
on the 8th day of Feb. 1744. Came to the United States of America in the year
1770. Died on the 12th day of April 1821 aged Seventy Seven years two months and
four days.&nbsp;</br>
 Catharine Gilchrist, wife of Malcolm Gilchrist, is buried in
Maury County, Tennessee, as previous written in other writings. I have today cleaned
the gravestone and verified without a doubt that this is indeed her grave next
to her son, Archibald Gilchrist rather in Old
Courtland Cemetery, Courtland, Lawrence County, Alabama. Nelda Stephenson, May 30 2006&nbsp;</br>
This is the inscription I found: CATHARINE GILCHRIST (Tombstone Inscription)
Sacred to the memory of Catharine Gilchrist wife of Malcolm Gilchrist who was
born in Cumberland County North Carolina June 30 1752 died Oct. 5 1839 aged 87
years 3 months and 5 days</br>
Everything that I have read and seen including the work of Robert W Gilchrist
states that Archibald Gilchrist was buried next to his parents in Maury County,
Tennessee; however, I have today scrubbed his tombstone clean it is his
inscription and stone without a doubt the stone is next to his mother, Catharine
Gilchrist, wife of Malcolm Gilchrist, in Old Courtland Cemetery, Courtland,
Lawrence County, Alabama. Nelda Stephenson, May 30 2006</br>
&nbsp;</br>
MONUMENT INSCRIPTION: Sacred to the memory of Archibald Gilchrist born on June
8th 1791 &amp; died Jan 11th 1852 aged ____ years, 7 mo. &amp; 3 days. All the
records show that he was born in 1794 but I believe that the inscription is
1791. Of course, I may be mistaken and the number of years lived is not legible.

All of his children settled nearer to the
Alabama-Tennessee line. They did live in Maury County, Tennessee but Maury
County covered a larger area at one time than it does today. I have this burning
desire to go to Hunter Cemetery and I will find out and let you know. Nelda</br>

&nbsp;Yes, I visited the
Hunter Cem a few years ago,and did see Malcolm srs grave site with tabletop
marker as described. If I remember correctly, there was grave for Archibald
also. It is just off the main highway. You cross a RR track and the Cem is to
the Left. I have a copy of Lumber River Scots and am pretty familiar with my
line of Malcolm. I am descended from Malcolm's son John through Johns youngest
son Cornelius Cameron Gilchrist 1816-1866. I currently live just across the Tn
river from Savannah Tennessee at Crump although I was born in Adamsville in
McNairy County (Adjoining) where the Gilchrist Community exists. Am a member of
Presby Church organized by Cornelius in 1866. Be advised I am not questioning
your find. My best guess was that Arch and Catherine Buie were left in Maury
when Ole Malcolm died and as all the other kids were gone they went to live with
their wealthy relatives in Alabama.&nbsp;</br>
Thanks for the article ref Malcolm and his cotton shipping efforts. I read a
version of it in a book in Savannah Library some years ago. Who is the John and
Anna Tittle Gilchrist? Enjoy networking.&nbsp;</br>
Cheers Gil</br>

Subject: Re: SUPRISE et al,WOW! Jo Ann, my friend, hasn't been to Hunter she
only researched the Internet sources, cemetery listings, etc. which all say the
same thing whether fact or fiction. The Malcolm who is supposed to be buried in
Hunter Cemetery was the father of Malcolm, Jr, Daniel, John and Duncan. I am
attaching a newspaper article about the Malcolm who was the land speculator. Are
you telling me that you saw the grave in Hunter Cemetery of Malcolm (1744-1821),
the father of the above? I plan to go there next week to see for myself what is
there. Thanks for the directions to the graves of John (1772-1852) and Malcolm
Jr in Combs Cemetery. I would like to have copies of any documents, articles,
etc. that you may have of Malcolm (1744-1821) or his sons, is you don't mind.
I'm sending in a separate email pictures of the tombstones in Courtland
Cemetery. Did the ones you saw look like them?&nbsp;</br>

 Hello again: New find, more mystery...Isn't it amazing. JO ANN of your
mention apparently saw the same as I on my visit to Hunter in Maury. Malcolms
son John 1772-1852 has an essentially exact table stone in the Gilchrist Cem in
McNairy Tn. His brother Malcolm visited in 1845 and died here. He has a similar
but not perfect reproduction (more like &quot;hand made&quot;) stone. He is
buried a short distance away in the Combs Cemetery which was near the &quot;then
in use Church&quot; as the Gilchrist Community cemetery was not in existence at
that time. There is a document on file in the McNairy County Registrars Office
dated 1845 that notes Malcolm, John, and their brother Duncan were &quot;Land
Speculators&quot;. I have copy of a document dated 1847, whereby John,Duncan,and
Daniel of Al, met in Decatur County Tn (nearby) to discuss disposal the late
brother Malcolms land holdings. Malcolm had hundreds of land grants and titles
per Tennessee records.He also owned an Island in the Miss River. Another
mystery.....LRS states that the above addressed Malcolm never married. I have a
Boderbound CD of Early marriages that lists Malcolm marrying in Maury County in
1824... Tip for finding Malcolm Sr gravesite in Hunter Cem, Now Abandoned...Look
for a very tall monument better described as a smaller version of the Washington
Monument of D.C. with a wrought iron fence ,being that of a DOBBINS who married
a Gilchrist per LRS. Malcolm's grave is nearby, but flat on ground (or was) as
Table &quot;legs&quot; have collapsed. New Subj: Your email notes
&quot;sons&quot; of Malcolm buried in Cypress Inn area. Wouldn't that be descendants
of Duncan as opposed to Malcolm Sr. The other brother not mentioned was William
who died in little Rock Ar in 1843.... Please tell Jo Ann I would be happy to
network with her on her decendancy of Malcolm........ Warm regards, and thanks
for waking us up, albeit on a subject that will be hard to resolve without some
research. Gil on the River , four mi north of Shiloh.</br>

Wayne, I am not saying that the tombstones have never been there in Hunter
Cemetery because I don't
know at this point but they were not there today. My husband and I scrubbed, washed, brushed
and scrubbed some more on all the flat slab tombstones at the cemetery that were
not legible already. We found Malcolm's daughter, Catharine, and her husband,
David Dobbins but no Malcolm, Catharine or Archibald. If they ever were there,
they have been moved to Courtland. I know that several say they have seen them
at Hunter but they are not there today. Nelda Stephenson, Florence, Alabama.

I have tonight found out that the tombstones were moved from Hunter Cemetery,
Maury County, Tennessee, to Old Courtland Cemetery, Courtland, Lawrence County,
Alabama. They were moved about two years ago, but only the tombstones were
moved. The graves that were under the stones were left intact. They were at one
time table top graves but all of them had sunk except the stones and the party
removed them because Malcolm's stone was already broken and the relative was
afraid that the remainder of the stones would also become broken. The cemetery
was in a state of abandonment and disrepair. I have not at the moment been able
to talk with the individual who moved the stones. Nelda Stephenson</br>
