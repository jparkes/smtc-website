</b><b>DICKSON, Sarah
J., 27 Sep 1824 - 29 Jul 1890. " Our Mother "; (Hunter Meetinghouse -
"Our Mother", &amp; "Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep. From which
none ever wake to weep.") There are two lines under the death
date that I could not read. This stone looks to me as though it has been
professionally put back on the base hopefully with the latest epoxies and
appears to be in good condition.  <br/>
