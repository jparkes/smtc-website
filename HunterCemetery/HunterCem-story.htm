&nbsp;Let me
tell you about my first trip to Hunter Cemetery with my Mother (Helen Cook
McClain). I was visiting Mother one summer after Daddy had died. That would
have been during 2003. He died in February of that year.<br>
We were in her sitting room and I ask her if she knew the location of Hunter
Cemetery. She looked at me like I had lost it. &quot;Of course I know where
Hunter Cemetery is, why?&quot; she said. &quot;When I was a kid, people were
still being buried there.&quot; So I ask her if she felt like taking me there if
it wasn't to far. Here we go, Mama drove. (she is at that age everyone else's
scares her.) Coming out of her drive way we turned right, went to the first red
light in Mt. Pleasant on Main Street, we turned left and went straight until you
get to a group of houses on the left that used to be called &quot;Scott
Town&quot;. All the people that worked the mines lived there. Past that is a
fork in the road, bear left going toward Arrow Lake. It is only about 1/2 mile
on the left.<br>
&quot;Where is the cemetery?&quot; I asked Mama. I saw the little white sign but
no tombstones. But right next to this weedy area was a really well kept nice
cemetery. It was Hunter Cemetery too! Then Mother told me that is where the
African American people are buried and it was very nice.<br>
So I got out of the car, and waded thru this mass of bushes and saplings, it was
unbelievable to my mind!<br>
When I reach a spot that I could actually see something it was a very imposing
memorial stone. In fact at this early stage of my cemetery interest, it was the
tallest one I had ever seen. Standing in one spot I looked around in a circle
and thought, &quot;Is my beloved McClain Cemetery ever going to look like this,
the very place where I chose for my remains to rest?&quot;<br>
I discover that day my grandma WILLIAMS father RICHARD STOCKARD is buried in
this very cemetery. How am I going to ever find his grave? I did not want to keep
Mother sitting out in the car so I trampled back to the road.<br>
We stopped in Mt. Pleasant at the Museum on the Square and I found the last
paperback book on Hunter Cemetery. It was coming unglued but I purchased it anyway. I
learned when the cemetery was established and some very interesting topics.
There was even a picture of some of the graves! in other words you could tell it
was a cemetery.<br>
Then and there I knew I would have to go back out there and take pictures of
Hunter Cemetery. In the winter when the snakes weren't crawling and some of the
foliage had died back from the cold. So now we know the motivating force that
propelled me back to Hunter Cemetery for the research &amp; Photography that
built this site.
