<p><b>He was married to Harriet HULL. Many of my
Hulls settled in Mt. Pleasant between 1843 and 1848. Most of this family moved
on to southeast Missouri by 1860. However, Harriet's brother, Rev Rowland
Randolph Hull raised his family of 9 children there. I've been told that he is
buried in the Baptist Cemetery in Theta. He died in 1906.</b></font></p>
