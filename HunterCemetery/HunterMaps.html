<pre align="center"><b>Hunter Cemetery is just southeast of Mt Pleasant Tennessee, past the fork of Highway 43 and the road to Enterprise 
community on what is known as the Military Road. It is on the left going southeast of what is shown above as Enterprise Road. It is a little tricky to see from Enterprise Road because of being on the back side of a hill.

This rough mapping of the two cemeteries known as Hunter Cemetery. Yellow borders in no way reflect the exact legal boundaries of these two cemeteries.
