<b>KING, Tennie, 29 Jan 1854
- 14 Jul 1875. (Chennault Lot.) <i><br/>
 As one can see this stone has fallen and also
broken. To make this stone new again would take the following steps: first
set and level the base at least 1.5 feet deep into the soil. Next remove that
old gooey cheap glue by cutting &amp; scrapping it off from the bottom and top
of the broken halves and also using a steel brush to clean &amp; smooth up the
surfaces to be bonded. Next use a glue called Sakidur 35 that will bond the two
halves together permanently. Apply the glue sparingly covering about 30% of the
bonding surfaces. If you have done a good job of leveling the base and cleaning
the surfaces you can apply the glue, set the top and base together and walk away
knowing you have done a good job. by Wayne Austin 4/27/06]</i> <br/>
