the cemetery. It sits on a four-tier pedestal, with a winged design at the top. It is inscribed on three 
sides. Stonecutter - W. Gland. Graffetti is carved on the side of the McGee stone - M. Harwell, Joe Wilkes, 
J.E.H., B. Woodard.- Hunter Meetinghouse, 1983.) This large four tiered monument is in very serious condition. 
There is yellow police tape around the base, because it looks like it is going to cave in. The yellow tape has been 
there since 2004 Spring.  <br clear="right">
