Believe I can now identify this crumbled stone as belonging to this listing: 
SPINDLE, Infant of John P. &amp; Emeline. (No dates or dates shaled away) This 
infant probably died with its mother (shown above)&nbsp; or near her death as 
she was Emeline Spindle. Photo by C. Wayne Austin 2008, List. </font></span></b></p>
