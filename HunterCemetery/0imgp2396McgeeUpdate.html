Wayne,</br>
There are repairs going on at the Hunter Cemetery in Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, Maury Co.&nbsp; I do not know who is doing the work but they are to be commended to a high degree in my opinion&nbsp; </br>
The memorial stone of the McGee family that had the yellow police tape around it&nbsp; on my last visit dated March 2005, has been worked on.<img   ID="MA14756037-0002" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="240" BORDER="0" DATASIZE="168130" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HunterCemetery/aoladp://MA14756037-0002/mcgee 2247.jpg"></br>
The tape has been removed, and the tiers have had some kind of support under them, and the cracks cemented or what ever is used, ( I know you understand what I am trying to say).</br>
</br>
Many tombstones at Hunter Cemetery have been lifted off of the ground and replaced onto their bases or replacement bases, I have tried to note the ones that were on the ground March of last year when I was there.&nbsp; </br>
</br>
To the right of the McGee memorial is the rock enclosed grave of John Smith.&nbsp; I am sure the next time I go out there the rock wall will be up or have been worked on, as there is yellow police tape around that lot this April 2006.</br>
</br>
The grass was ankle deep, and I was a little afraid to venture deep into the cemetery for fear of snakes, but onward I tromped thur the weeds etc.&nbsp; I have many many pictures of fieldstone markers although there were many many more covered by weeds, some I could make out a letter or two.&nbsp; These I will send to you also.&nbsp; If you compare the pictures of 2005 to 2006 you can really tell a difference.</br>
</br>
I really appreciate the time you take away from YOUR family to read, edit, and post all that you do for Maury Co., Tn., and it's history and preservation of cemeteries there.&nbsp; Three years ago I didn't even know where Hunter Cemetery was and I had lived there all my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldn't have matter if I had known where it was, it was so grown up you couldn't tell it was a cemetery.&nbsp; A new sign has been place there which I will get you a picture of that.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the cemetery is becoming quite beautiful now.&nbsp; I recieved a newspaper clipping from my sister, Elizabeth, that said Ms. Juanita Keys had been in charge of a restoration project for Hunter Cemetery.&nbsp; Ms. Keys is related to the Capt. J.C. Cooper family buried there as well as myself.&nbsp; Let me tell you, there is a wonderful thing being done at Hunter Cemetery and I think your web site has something to do with a lot of people reading it and wanting to help RESTORE and PRESERVE these old Maury County Cemeteries.&nbsp; You Rock Wayne, thank you for what you do.</br>
