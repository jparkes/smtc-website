_, S. W., footstone, (1820-1850 style stone grown over by giant Oak tree. Footstone
S.W.H.) (5084,85)<br/>
Inscription: Unknown, surname may be Haines.<br/>
Footstone with initials S.W.H. The tree is now decaying and one day will reveal
the inscription of this stone as the large trunk decays and falls away. That may
be at the expense of other stones around the tree because the giant tree limbs will die
and likely break off and come smashing down on them. Based on the general way a
large Red Oak dies after about 150 to 200 years. The trunk on this one already
has major decay.Â <br/>
