The Joseph P Caruthers memorial facing its normal easterly direction. The bottom
image was made by turning the stone toward the western sunshine thereby
capturing the shadows of the sunlight on the face of the inscription. After the
photo the stone was returned to its normal easterly facing direction and reset.
Amazing the difference, one would call the inscription worn looking above when
in actuality it is just the lighting.</br>
