CREEK/BROWN/OLD CITY CEMETERY, (Southeast of Columbia).</br>

</font><b>Anderson, (no
given name), March 8, 1827- July 23, 1855. (Actually the interred may be a
slave. He/she died prior to the freeing of the slaves. According to history
slaves did not use surnames but only single given names so in this instance the
name Anderson could be a given name or a singular name.) This stone is located
away from the other main graves down next to the Lytle Creek. I did not find
anymore memorial stones in that area, but evidence of other graves abound.
Stones are scattered around this cemetery consistent with the way Greenwood City
evolved. That is a reflection that slave graves are found some around the outer
perimeters.&nbsp;</br>
