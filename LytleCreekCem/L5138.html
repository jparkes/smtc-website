</font><b>I think this is
the top of a broken stone which is the first stone for Priscilla Thomas. Maybe
later in the 1830s or 1840 her stone below was set to replace this one. The
above stone style dates itself to the 1819 era whereas the one below looks later
around 1840 to 1850.</br>
Inscription remaining ROUND: Here lies the remains of CENTER: Priscilla Thomas
Daughter of ---- (I am sure there is other inscription on the (lost) bottom half
of the stone.). This was found near the Ann Anderson stone.&nbsp;</br>
