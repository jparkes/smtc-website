Forrest Butner was the only child of my great-grandfather John Scott<br>
Morgan Butner and his second wife Simmie Lorene Russell. He was born<br>
about 1903 in Maury County, TN, and died on February 12, 1910.</p>
<p align="center">My great-grandmother, John Butner's first wife Lettia Ann
Scott, is<br>
also buried in Neapolis Cemetery in an unmarked grave. She was born<br>
about 1847, probably in Coffee County, TN, and died about 1891 in<br>
Maury County.</p>
