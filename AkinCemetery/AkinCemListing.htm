1987, it was reported that the high rock wall was falling and brush was covering 
most of the monuments.<br><br>There are no doubt many families who gave more than their share to the cause 
during the War Between the States, but probably none in Maury County who equaled 
	that of the Akin family. In the book Confederate Soldiers and Patriots of 
Maury County, Tennessee, pages 4-6, are listed -- William C. Akin, Marshall T. 
Akin, Henry Lawson Akin, and Robert T. Akin. Only Robert survived the war. The 
other three who died during the war are buried in this family cemetery. One 
other son, also buried here, died during the same period but was too young to 
have served in the army.<br><br>[<i>All listings above modified for family
