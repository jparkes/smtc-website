<p align="center"><b>AKIN 
CEMETERY, (North of Hwy 412) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br/>
<img border="0" height="725" src="https://smtc-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AkinCemetery/AkinCemGPS.jpg" width="1221"/><br/>
This map shows the GPS as: N 35.65306, W 86.98599. From Columbia go east on Highway 99/412 for 2-1/4 miles. Turn 
(left) north on Baker Road and go one mile. 
Turn (right) north again on Still Pond Road leading to the old Akin house. The cemetery is about 
500 feet beyond the barn. I am not aware of the old Aiken home survives today.<br/>

The Old barn does not appear to be there anymore and I also don't know the land 
owner's name, but there appears to be a right of way on Still Pond Road. After that I 
can't tell here. <br/>

With this aerial view
one can actually see the rock wall outlined with a yellow highlighter and the 
center of the cemetery marked with a red check. I would say park on still Pond 
Rd which does not appear to be a paved road. This point is due south of the 
cemetery. Walk north thru the woods to the rock wall where inside you will find 
this historic cemetery.<br/>
