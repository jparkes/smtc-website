LOFTIN, John &amp;
Sarah, 1846.</br>
There are a couple of ways to see this stone. Either it is a couple John &amp;
Sarah Loftin who died in 1846 with no mention of birth dates. Also it might be
twin infants who were born and died in 1846. Also it might be a brother and
sister who died of one of the infectious diseases in 1846. Use of the censuses
to analyze this may clarify this issue.</br>
