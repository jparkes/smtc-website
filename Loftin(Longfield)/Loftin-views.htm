Looking west shows the central part and a view of most of the stones in the
cemetery. As you can see from this view the Alfred Loftin inscription is not on
the opposite side of the stone from his wife Emily, assuming (I have not proven
that) Emily was his wife.&nbsp;<br>

photo was taken while standing in the southeast corner of the cemetery shooting
across the unknown rock crypt. This is a large stack of select stones used also
as a means of marking a grave in earlier times. This tends to be the first type
of grave markings in use and sprang up before inscribed stones started becoming
widely available in the southeast. Inscribed stones in Maury county can be found
as old as about 1814. Of course there were also far fewer settlers in that time
frame. I would therefore date this as between the dates of 1814 and 1850 as a theoretical
approach to a resolution as to who might be interred here. I don't believe this
crypt it is for the graves of Longfield &amp; Mary Loftin. They have foot and
head stones still in place. They died in 1836 &amp; 1851 and the style of
memorial in use tells me their stones were placed sometimes after 1870 and
before 1915 by later descendents to mark their graves.</span></font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><i><br>
