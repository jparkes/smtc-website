</b></p><center><b>Go out Hwy 412/Hampshire Pike past
Cross Bridges and turn right (or north) on Booker Farm Road. Go 2 1/2 miles.
After the third sharp (left) bend in the road go another 1/2 mile and the road
will bend right. Go another 1/2 mile and the road will bend left again. Right
there on your right should be a farm road crossing the creek. Take that if
feasible and follow it 500 yards until you are across the creek and inside the
tree line going up the hill. Get out there and walk south along the same
elevation and the cemetery should be no more than about 50 yards from your
vehicle or the farm road. The yellow highlighted marking points out the farm
road. We do not know if the route has pad locked gates or if permission is
required.
