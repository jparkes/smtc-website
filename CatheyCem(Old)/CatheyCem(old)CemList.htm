<p align="center"><b>OLD
CATHEY CEMETERY, BOOKER FARM RD, (Western) MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</b></p>

<p>Go out Hwy 412/Hampshire Pike past Cross
Bridges and turn right (or north) on Booker Farm Road. Go 2 1/2 miles. After the
third sharp (left) bend in the road go another 1/2 mile and the road will bend
right. Go another 1/2 mile and the road will bend left again. Right there on
your right should be a farm road crossing the creek. Take that if feasible and
follow it 500 yards until you are across the creek and inside the tree line
going up the hill. Get out there and walk south along the same elevation and the
cemetery should be no more than about 50 yards from your vehicle or the farm
road. The yellow highlighted marking points out the farm road. We do not know if
the route is lined with pad locked gates or if permission is required.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b>
