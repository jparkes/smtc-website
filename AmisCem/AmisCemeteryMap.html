</b>The Longitude
&amp; Latitude coordinates for this cemetery are given above. They look
reasonable, but appear to be too far east and north of the house.<b><br/>

From Culleoka take Valley Creek Rd. for 1.25 miles and turn left (south) on
Pullen Mill Rd. After crossing Fountain Creek turn left again and go up hill to
the Ramsey-Finney house that is on the National Registry of Historic Places. The
cemetery is now enclosed in a new wooden fence behind shed above house. Go there
only with permission. It would be a foolish assertion to say this historic place
had nothing to do with this graveyard. Likely the Amis folks founded this home
though it bears not their name in the historic registers.  The yellow
pointer reflects the GPS coordinates but the real location I believe would
probably be further (due south) south above the buildings near this house with
the red top.<i><br/>
