<b>This cemetery was evidently the object of vandalism in the distant past and 
has been abandoned for many years. It was once enclosed in a fine stone wall but 
this is now broken down in several places. Several fieldstones and parts of 
three dismantled box tombs are visible. Parts of several spires can also be 
seen, but these are scattered and no inscriptions are to be found. Commentary by

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS"><b>Few of Maury 
County's historic houses have been more prominent in its history than has 
Fairmount. Located just at the point where the new section of Hwy. #50 
intersects the Mooresville Pike, the house is visible to all <br>
passers-by. Built by John Smiser, one of the areas early immigrants from 
Maryland, it was completed about 1837 and immediately became a center of the 
social life of Maury County, Middle Tennessee and other parts of the country.
<br>
When Mr. Smiser passed away in 1840, the estate passed to his daughter, Ellen, 
who had married James Gray Booker. He was a son of Peter Booker and the two 
prominent families naturally drew an increasingly large number of visitors to 
Fairmount. <br>
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Fairmount became a center of Confederate 
activity. It was here that the 9th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment was formed and 
trained in 1861. <br>
This unit, made up mainly of Maury County men, rode away from Fairmount to 
support the armies of the South in many of its important engagements. 
Confederate Generals often made Fairmount their command post and one wonders how 
the big house escaped the Federal army's torch, as, unhappily was the fate of 
many of its neighbors. After the war, the estate continued to be passed from one 
generation to the next until about this century when it was sold. For some time 
it served as a Retirement Home for aged citizens and the structure was allowed 
to run down. Later, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lex Watson acquired the place and engaged in 
several years of restoration work. Fairmount is now once again one of Maury 
County's antebellum showpieces. (See Garrett, Jill K., Hither and Yon, 1986, p. 
235.) <br>
