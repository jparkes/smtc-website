just west of Columbia out new Hwy 50, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</b><br>

<font color="#000080" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>From Columbia go east on 
Hwy 50 (James Campbell Blvd.) and turn north (left) on Tom J. Hitch Parkway. Go 
a mile+ and turn right (east) on Mapleash Ave. Go about a 100 yards and turn 
right into the driveway with permission. The cemetery is thought to be in back 
of the house near a power pole. From the looks of Maps the area is well groomed, 
but the stones are all fallen and fractured. Maybe this is just one of those 
cemeteries that do not warrant a visit because of the decline in its state. I 
cannot say for sure because I have no proof of anything except a subjective map 
evaluation. I do know the status of most of these old cemeteries is sad.<br>

This closer-in aerial view shows the cemetery pointed out by the white arrow 
under a utility pole.<br>

This aerial view shows the cemetery which appears to be scattered between an 
outbuilding and a utility pole. I have not been here but this is the location 
plotted on Topographical maps as containing the cemetery. Topographical Maps are 
generally the most accurate of our maps since it depicts the topography and was 
drawn up with painstaking effort in the 1940s.<br>

Alert: This location describes where this old home and cemetery can be found 
according to Fred Lee Hawkins. If so the other four maps above are some other 
cemetery of which I do not know the name of. This is north of Skyline Dr. If 
this is true then the old home has been demolished or fallen down or maybe it is 
camouflaged in the trees above.<br>
