This map shows the Latitude &amp; Longitude Coordinates of this Cemetery using
another NAD27 methodology. The Plotting in relation to the Herman Church Road is
incorrect anyway for this cemetery. I found it at approximately N 35.75106 X W
87.13522 which is several hundred feet north of where the above map places the red check for
this cemetery. The topography appears correct for the cemetery
to be located where our directions specified as in the bend of the Herman Church
Road shown as a dotted line unimproved road on the above map.</b></font><b><font color="#000080"  size="2"><br>

In Santa Fe, go north on Fly Road for 1 and 1/2 miles. Turn west on Herman
Church Rd. The cemetery is on the right just after the road bends (right) to the
north in the trees about 50 yards from the road. Hard to spot in the summer
thickets.)<br>
