<b>
From Mt. Pleasant, take Hampshire Pike to Needmore and turn north on Gipson
Hollow Rd. Go about two miles to McAnally place. Old cemetery is on hillside
behind the barn. (I rate this the better instructions set, but do not know the
owner today.) Basically to get to what was then and may still be the McAnally
place one would follow Dog Branch east (map above) along the McAnally home
entranceway. The old map above does not show that driveway from Gipson Hollow
Rd.</b><br/>

<b>Obviously you will need permission to
visit this cemetery, but if you have that by phone or by letter you may be able
to use these instructions. This is developed using the map features here. 
Go out of Mt Pleasant on Hwy 166 or the Mt Pleasant to Hampshire Pike about 4
miles and turn right onto McAnally Road. Go about 6 tenths of a mile and turn
left or north on the field road marked in yellow above. Assuming there is no pad
locked gate follow that for about 3 tenths of a mile and stop (because the field
road plays out) and get out and walk north the rest of the way to the place
indicated on the Aerial Map above. The Cemetery is in the clump of trees down
next to (south) Dog Branch on the hillside. You will walk about another 2 tenths
of a mile north from where the vehicle was parked. </b><i><br/>
<b>I make no guarantees this information will find this cemetery
nor do I make any reservations of the dangers you will face. That is between you
and the land owner but certainly if you try this you should have the guts to
take responsibility for yourself and hold no one liable for any bad outcome
experienced. Wayne Austin.</b></i> <br/>
