GPS Coordinates for the Wells Cemetery shown above are incorrect. This is the
coordinates for the Watkins (Benjamin) Cemetery.&nbsp; That means the Wells Map
is dislocated by the all the GPS companies. </b></font><b><font color="#000080" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">This map labeled Wells Cemetery comes to us from Topozone 
and is part of an effort by the large modern GPS mapping companies to place all 
the cemeteries in the country on locator maps. Each cemetery has a Longitude and 
Latitude also known as the GPS coordinates. This placement is in error because 
the spot on the map actually belongs to the Benjamin Watkins Cemetery. The Wells 
Cemetery lies on the area of this map, but due east 1/2 mile across both feeder 
branches to Rutherford Creek. It is not marked on this or any other maps I am 
aware of except for Fred Hawkins Map in the book Maury County Tennessee 
Cemeteries. Maury County historian Fred Hawkins in the book Maury County 
Cemeteries documented the Wells Cemetery, but omitted the Watkins Cemetery. Same 
for researchers before him. All researchers say the Wells Cemetery is behind the 
barn of descendent John Wells on the back side of his place. There are no modern 
maps showing a barn in this highly developed area. There are only houses and 
shopping malls.<br>

The correct GPS coordinates for the Thomas Wells Cemetery are: Latitude - 
35.7395�N&nbsp; Longitude - 86.8971�W<br>

</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080" size="2"><b>The red check
marks the spot where the Thomas Wells Cemetery can be found. To get there from
Spring Hill go east on Saturn Parkway and exit north on Port Royal Road. Follow
Port Royal Road north until it bends 90 degrees westward. Go a few hundred yards
and turn south (left) into Somerset Springs Dr.. This is a road into a condominium
complex. Follow that road for about 1/4 mile and look to your right upon a bank
behind the houses on Queen's Place and Queens Court. The cemetery is nestled in a
corner of a fence row inside a chain link fence.&nbsp;</b><br>

</font><b><font color="#000080" size="2">This aerial map above shows the cemetery
nestled in a corner behind the houses on Queens Place. Better access is from
Somerset Springs Drive. The actual road is extended further than on this map
shows. I
cannot say this will always be the best approach to this cemetery. If new houses are
built all along that road then you will be faced with getting permission to
cross someone's yard.<i><br>

little fenced square area facing east/west which is the cemetery.<i><br>
