<p>Revised here 13 Jul 2009 to include finding
and transcribing of this cemetery. Considering all the construction bulldozing in that area
and the large
mounds of earth, rock and old road pavement piled around I am surprised this
little cemetery survived. It did, thanks to responsible construction crews. It has a new surrounding chain link
fence and I believe someone is caring for the grounds.&nbsp;I was able to find
this cemetery by repeated efforts and analyzing maps that were not so specific,
but nevertheless they helped. This listing based on a 24 Feb 2009 finding and
visit by Wayne Austin. We did not ask permission because this cemetery was on
public development grounds. I cannot say that it always will be. Access could
get very difficult with closed off private property completely surrounding it in
the future.</p>
<p><i>Listed in &quot;Maury County
Tennessee Cemeteries&quot;, page 74, 15 Jan 1987, by Fred Lee Hawkins, Also listed in &quot;They Passed This Way&quot;,&nbsp;3
Feb 1964, page C-13, by Evelyn
Shackleford &amp; Marise Lightfoot. Old timer Mr. John Wells aided both Fred (1987) and
Marise &amp; Evelyn (1964) in the information contained in their books and the
location of this cemetery on his land.&nbsp;I did find a few minor mistakes in
their reporting. For this site the listing was first compiled by Mary Bob McClain from &quot;Maury County Tennessee
Cemeteries&quot; by Fred L. Hawkins. 6 Jan 2009. Information then was revised &amp;
added here by Wayne Austin 13 Jul 2009 based on a 24 Feb 2009 visiting and
survey of this cemetery.</i><b><i> </br>
