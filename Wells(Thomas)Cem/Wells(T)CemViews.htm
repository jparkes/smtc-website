This grafted photo from three smaller one shows the entire cemetery in one view.
Our view is toward the south across the cemetery and also at the backs of a few
houses fronting Queens Place St. No access from there to this cemetery. Notice
the gate in the northwest corner.&nbsp;</br>

Standing inside the cemetery and looking north this is the view one will get
looking at the Somerset Springs Drive. This gives one a perspective of how to
find this cemetery, but may change.</b></center>
