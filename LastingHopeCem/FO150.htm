HOPE CEMETERY, CARTER'S CREEK, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#800000"  size="2">FOSTER, Talitha R., 4 
Dec 1839 - 31 Dec 1921. (nee Talitha Rachel Jameson; wife Joseph N. Foster.)<br>
</font><font color="#000080"  size="2"><br>

A very noble woman passed into her reward on Saturday evening when Mrs. Tabitha 
J. Foster heard the �last clear call and quietly sank into the deep sleep from 
which none ever wake to weep� at the home of her daughter, Miss Josephine 
Foster. <br>
<br>
Mrs. Foster had been ill for several months, but was confined to bed for only a 
few days. Nearly a year ago, she lost her sight and, since this time, had 
undergone one major and two or three minor operations in the hope that sight 
would be regained and not altogether in vain, for she could see the color of 
flowers and she told the writer joyously �I saw my grandson�s face today for the 
first time in six months.� Her cheerful and patient bearing of this great 
affliction was marvelous. Only a splendid Christian that she was could have had 
such fortitude.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Foster was the oldest of fourteen children and at age 82, was the last of 
this wonderful family to die. She was married to Joseph Malloy Foster in July, 
1865 and lived at Carter�s Creek until his death. She and Joseph had seven 
children and was survived by four: Miss Josephine Foster and Mrs. Olivia Foster 
Elder, of Florence, Alabama; Mr. Eugene Foster, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Mr. 
Nick Foster, of Birmingham, Alabama. She also reared a grandson, Mr. Howard 
Roberts, and their devotion to each other was beautiful.<br>
A sweet service was held on Sunday afternoon at the home of her daughter, Miss 
Foster, and was conducted by Rev. Harding of the Christian Church, of which the 
deceased was a faithful and loyal member from girlhood. On Monday, the beloved 
mother was taken to Carter�s Creek and laid to rest in Lasting Hope Cemetery.<br>

places, thus the above is not 100% �word for word�. -------Wanda Bradford 25 Aug
