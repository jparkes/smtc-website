<b>KENNEDY, Elizabeth P.
Bennett, 10 Sep 1800 ï¿½ 5 Jan 1853 (first wife of James Kennedy; daughter of
Dr. George W. Bennett and Anna Dabney; married James on 1 Sep 1831 in Williamson
County). <i>Photo &amp; info by Rick Gray 6/14/04. Update by Rick Gray:<br/>
I have since found out that Elizabeth was most likely not a Bennett. In fact I
am not sure what her maiden name is at this point. (12 Nov 2008) The Elizabeth
Bennett who married James Kennedy died much earlier than the Elizabeth Bennett
buried here did. She died in the late 1830's according to her obituary published
in Williamson County. I just recently found that. So it leaves me at a quandary
in my research there. [Rick Gray 12 Nov 2008]</i><p></p>
