</i>PASSMORE, Emily
G., 28 Mar 1844 - 29 Mar 1845.<br/>
PASSMORE, Emeline M., (b. 14 Mar 1814) - d. 25 Oct 1906. "Twin
sister." (Dau. Richard B. &amp; Sarah Armstrong Passmore.)<br/>
[A couple of unresolved issues with this interpretation. Previous historians put
the birth dates 30 years apart for twins. The birth year cannot be clearly interpreted
as 1844 or 1814 nor can the death date of Emeline M. clearly be seen as 1906.
1814 to 1906 seems a bit long here. The stone does not date to that era. 1845 is
more clearly the date of the stone but maybe the twin sister Emeline was added
to the 1845 stone in 1906. This has to be resolved by cleaning and transcribing
the stone again. WA 2/20/2008] <i><br/>
