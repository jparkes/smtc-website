<p align="center">LASTING HOPE CUMBERLAND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH HISTORY</p>





<p>Rev. R. D. King was one
of the early circuit riders of the C. P. Church in Middle Tennessee. In 1825 he
made one of his normal trips through Maury County and heard of the need of a
congregation in the Carter's Creek area, A woman, named Mrs. R. T. Lockridge,
concerned about the moral decay of the neighborhood, had taken upon herself the
task of praying for a change to occur. Rev. King, upon hearing of the need and
of the interest, arranged to preach in the<br/>
home of Mrs. Lockridge. Great interest was aroused and a congregation formed.</p>
<p>The first building was a
small one, built of hewn poplar logs, cut from the virgin forest of the
neighborhood. Mr. Lockridge donated the land. Later, a frame building was
constructed on the same site and this remained until burned by Federal soldiers
during the Civil War. For a few years during the war the congregation ceased to
function on a regular basis. It started again with the return of the Confederate
veterans and soon a new building rose upon the same spot. This one was used
until 1910 when the members decided to replace the old structure. Although the
congregation never grew very large, it was able to carry on its work and even to
build its new building without going into debt. In 1919, however, fire destroyed
the build ing and the church decided that it would be better to disband the
congregation. Today all that remains to show where this series of buildings set
is the old cemetery. </p>
