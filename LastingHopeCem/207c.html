</b>Comrades = The dread Angel has again visited our association. This time he
has taken from our now thin gray line, our dear Comrade Charles S. Nichols<br/>
Who died at his home near Carters Creek on the 13th of April [1917] in the 83rd
year of his life.<br/>
Our comrade enlisted early in 1861 in the first company that went from Maury.
Co. N. [G] 1st Regt Tenn. Infantry C.S.A. with this command he served in all its
marches and battles in Virginia and Tennessee and was considered a brave
reliable and patriotic soldier, in 1863 he was transferred [sic] at his own
request to 48th Tenn. Infantry Col. W. M. Voorhies commanding, so as to be with
his brother a member of that Regiment. On being transferred [sic] to the 48th
Regt he was detailed to serve on the Infirmary corps, which dangerous duties he
fulfilled with the most utter disregard for his personal danger, when wounded
men were to be cared for, amidst storms of flying bullets and bursting shells.
His bravery and devotion to duty was especially [sic] noted, in the bloody
battle of Peach Tree Street near Atlanta Georgia, where for hours it seemed that
nothing could live in the dreadful storm of battle, where 514 out of the 954 of
the Regiment were killed or wounded. He [page 2] went back and forth caring for
wounded comrades with a heroism that drew the admiration of his comrades at the
time and will be remembered as long as memory serves them. In the Camp, on the
march and on the battle field he was at all times a faithful, duty loving
soldier, temperate and moral in his habits, ready at all times to give that
encouragement and advice that was elevating, moral and Christ like in character.
In his home for long years he was all that went to make a kind and loving
husband and father. As a member of the Presbyterian Church for half a century
none was more faithful to its teachings or more devoted to his duty as a
Christian.<br/>
As a Citizen he was honored and respected by all who knew him, always found on
the right side of all questions effecting the good of his people. To sum it all
up he was one of "Gods noble men"<br/>
We as a Bivouac extend our sympathies to his bereaved family and commend them
for comfort to that God that he loved and served so faithfully.<br/>
