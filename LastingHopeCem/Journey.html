<p align="center"><b>LASTING
HOPE CEMETERY, CARTER'S CREEK, MAURY COUNTY TENNESSEE</br>
</br>
JOURNEY, Olive Blanche, 10 Sep 1800 - 5 Jan 1853. Age 53. &quot;Wife of James
Kennedy.&quot; (I do not know the meaning of why there are two listing with the
same birth and death dates one Olive Blanche Journey and the second Elizabeth P.
Bennett Kennedy, both are listed as the wives of James Kennedy)</font></b></p>

<p><b>Rick Gray do you know why there is two
listings onJourney, Olive Blanche and Elizabeth P Bennett Kennedy. Both have the
same b &amp; d dates and both listed as the wives of James Kennedy. Elizabeth is
on the memorial stone correctly listed in the site. Any ideas here?</br>
</br>
Wayne, I know that I corrected that before I sent it. I have it corrected on my
master copy.</br>
</br>
That is an error of the late Mr. Fred Hawkins. I meant to find the Journey grave
when I went there and get her actual info. Mr. Hawkins thinks that he wrote
things down wrong. I agreed with him because Olive Journey was never married to
my great-uncle James Kennedy and those dates are for his wife. So I have no idea
what Olive's actual dates are since I didn't find her tombstone.</br>
</br>
Hope that helps some.</b></font><b></br>
