is bush-hog mowing over this stone. That is not good. The bush-hog mower is
gouging the stone and causing serious damage. Need proof? The circular shaped
brown streaks of rusty greasy metal show up in a circular pattern. That is the
shape of the circular moving metal blades of the giant mower. The stone itself
is seriously damaged by the blades striking the surface and chipping away the
sides and top of the stone. It is better to let the thickets take over the area
than have this. Why do I  think it is a bush-hog? because no normal size
mower would roll over this tall stone that sticks up from the ground about 6"
high.<br/>
