For more information see the book Maury County Tennessee Cemeteries, 1987, VOL
II,&nbsp; page 689, for more
genealogies, history, cemetery listings &amp; analysis.
Listed in They Passed This Way, Lightfoot &amp; Shackleford, page A-134. Mr Fred
in MCTC mentions there were several stones not found by him that the book
Authors of T.P.T.W. found in the 1960s. We found three more dycus memorial
listings than he did but the Peytons memorials were moved so this visitor missed
one stone that Mr. Fred found. That is the James N. Noles memorial. Likely that
has sunken into the ground and is hard to find.</font></p>
<p><i><font color="#000080" >This cemetery is basically abandoned though someone
is bush-hog mowing around the premises. That is not good. The bush-hog mower is
gouging the stones and causing serious damage where the stones are in the open
away from trees.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This cemetery previously was known as the Peyton Cemetery with a secondary name
of Patton Cemetery. Since many of the Peyton graves were moved to
Arlington Cemetery it is fitting to now predominately call it the Patton Cemetery
with the secondary name of Peyton Cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
