<b>14 Oct 1987: Across road from
Burcham Pond on Parson's Bend Road behind Montsano Company property. The pond
has now dried up and the area is being mined.</br>
24 Mar 2009: From the intersection of Hampshire Pike &amp; Williamsport Pike go
about 8 miles and turn right on Craig Bridge Road. Follow that northeast about 1
&amp; 1/2 miles and turn right on Parsons Bend Road. The cemetery is about 2
miles east on Parsons Bend Road on the left in the trees. Look for a new well
made cattle gap entrance and the cemetery entrance will be the next one. One
cannot drive into the cemetery area. It has many unmarked graves. It is being
restored by Johnny Eskew, the Caretaker.&nbsp;</br>
