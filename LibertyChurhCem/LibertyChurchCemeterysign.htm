This photo shows the sign that greets one at the entrance to the old Liberty
Church of Christ site &amp; cemetery on (Bennett G.) Parsons Bend Road in the western part of Maury County in the Parsons Bend of
the Duck River. On the left is a heavy farming operation in progress so do not
find yourself on that property if you are fortunate enough to visit this
historical site.&nbsp;<br>
Maybe there are some old church rolls that survived to one day be found to
reveal who the inhabitants of this old graveyard may be. Lets hope so.<br>

This sign shows the contacts if one needs to discuss the cemetery with Johnny
Eskew, the Caretaker. I suppose the tone of this sign was set because of the
difficulty with the neighbors over the property line which is now settled and
all is back in a peaceful state.<br>
