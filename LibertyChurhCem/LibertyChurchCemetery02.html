Benjamin F. &amp; Franklin B. Warfield, the only stones found inscribed in this
cemetery today. The headstone of Franklin is shown as a pile of crumbled rock on
our right side of Benjamin F. Warfield memorial. It is crumbling badly and the
inscription is partially lost. Johnie Eskew must have discovered this stone. It
is not listed by any known previous family historian.<br/>

This little footstone for Franklin B. Warfield survives intact with the initials
F.B.W.<br/>

WARFIELD, Franklin B., dates unknown. (This stone is crumbling and nothing else
readable. Looks like a memorial style used between 1830 &amp; 1850)<br/>
What can be read is: "In memory of Franklin B. Warfield who departed this
life . . . . .." (I think the little piece lying at the bottom is the B. as
in Franklin B.)<br/>
