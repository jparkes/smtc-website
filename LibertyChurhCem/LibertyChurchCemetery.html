<p>This is the site of the old Liberty Church of Christ which functioned from
the 1848 to about 1940. The church house and cemetery have long been demolished.
What is left there today of the cemetery is a couple of marked stones and about 60 or 70
fieldstones marking graves spread over a wide area of about 1 acre. Also left
are piles of rock that lined the graves or were used in the old church building
as foundation rock. Olden hand molded style brick can also be found on the site,
but historical sources say this church building was of frame construction
indicating the brick were used in a chimney or the foundation. The brick &amp; rocks are left
there today organized in groups by Johnny Eskew as a part of the cemetery
restoration effort he is carrying out.&nbsp;Johnny is working on installing a
military marker for David Eskew for his service during the Civil War.

History</br>
</br>
An early Christian Church was organized on this site sometimes before 1830
meeting in the open air for a time. Reconstructed records show the church &amp;
cemetery grounds to be in an area of 1.8 acres. During the 1840s a log structure
was erected.&nbsp; Luke S. White in 1870 tore down the log
church and erected a frame building at his own expense to further the Gospel.
After many years as a community church the last service was conducted in the
Winter of 1931. This building continued to stand until 1950 when it was salvaged
to build Sunday School classes at Arkland Church of Christ. The members of this church
had merged with the Arkland
Church of Christ in nearby Sawdust.&nbsp; Today (2009)
the only sign of a church having been there is the remnants of this
cemetery and foundation rocks. There are many graves here still today marked
only with fieldstones.&nbsp;<b>
