Benjamin F. &amp; Franklin B. Warfield, the only stone found inscribed in this
cemetery today. The headstone of Franklin shown as a pile of crumbled rock on
our right side of Benjamin F. Warfield memorial is crumbling badly and the
inscription is partially lost. Johnie Eskew must have discovered this stone. It
is not listed by any known previous family historian.<br/>
