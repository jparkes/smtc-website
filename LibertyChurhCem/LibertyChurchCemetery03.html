Here we can see the Confederate Colors waving in the sunlight faintly in the
distance for the old Soldier David Eskew whose presence graced the south in his
day. A military marker is in the process of being installed here.&nbsp;</br>

David O. Eskew a Confederate Soldier memorial. Sorry I could not capture the
flag and the text from this plaque together. If the flag had been captured the
text would not have been readable. It was a standard Confederate Battle Flag.</br>

ESKEW, David Owen, 18 Aug 1828 - 30 Aug 1876. Company F., 14th Tennessee,
Infantry, Confederate States Army during the Civil War. (Son of Bryant &amp;
Polly A. Sowell Eskew; married to Elizabeth White Boles.) There also is a 
military monument in Mt Nebo Cemetery for David. I am unaware of which place he 
was buried. Likely it is here though.One difference is the name is spelled with 
an E. instead of an A. in this memorial.</br>
