</font><u>Obituary of Elizabeth Kennedy,&nbsp; from Tom Childers</u><font color="#663300"><br>
</font>Elizabeth Hunter Kittrell was born on December 14, 1886. She was baptized 
into Christ in 1899; was married to J. C. Kennedy on April 18, 1912; and died on 
October 11, 1912. She finished at the Nashville Bible School when she was 
eighteen years old, the youngest graduate the school had up to that time. She 
taught several years, always striving to exert an influence for good over her 
pupils. Elizabeth had a brilliant mind and great strength of character, but, 
above all else, she was just sweet and helpful. She was everything to her 
brothers and sisters. What this loss means to us, God only knows, but we have 
his promises to comfort us. In everything her Christian duty came first. When it 
was possible, she was at the Lords table upon the first day of the week, and she 
ended each day with reading and prayer. In every relation of life she faithfully 
discharged her duty. Between her and her young husband there existed a perfect 
love and trust. He cared for her with great tenderness and consideration during 
the weeks of illness. She suffered terrible agony, but she never uttered one 
impatient word. Her death was glorious and sublime. She seemed no more conscious 
of earthly things when she spoke the last words, as if to some loved one across 
the river: Darling, I'm coming over, and its so sweet. Then, with a peaceful, 
childlike expression upon her face, she fixed her beautiful radiant eyes on 
something far beyond the reach of mortal vision; and so she fell asleep. Dear 
little angel sister! It was such a blessing to have her for a little while, even 
though it was such anguish to give her up. Love never faileth; and she was love 
itself. Having had her, we can better understand the matchless love of the 
Savior, who always sacrificed his human need of rest and food to minister to 
others. Life with her was, to us, a foretaste of the happiness of heaven; the 
radiance in her dying eyes, a glimpse of its glory. Her pure, unselfish life 
will always be an inspiration to us to live nearer to God, and with his help we 
hope to meet her again. Words of comfort were spoken by Brother F. C. Sowell and 
she was laid to rest at the Old Well burial ground. --Her Sister. Gospel 
Advocate, January 2, 1913, page 18.<br>
