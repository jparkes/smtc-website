</b><b>This view
looks across the cemetery at a majority of the memorials. In addition to the
memorials we see four old Box Elders Shrubs near the road. They are big enough
to be more than 50 years old.  <br/>
This place is lovingly cared for by folks who obviously have a high regard for
those gone before, great self esteem for themselves and a sense of wellness in
the community.<br/>
