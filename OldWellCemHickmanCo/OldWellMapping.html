WELL CEMETERY, Natchez Trace, HICKMAN COUNTY,&nbsp; TENNESSEE</br>

Believe this map locates the Old Well Cemetery incorrectly.&nbsp;</br>

Believe this map also locates the Old Well Cemetery incorrectly. It is based on
the USGS mapping coordinates.</br>

</u></font></font><b>Because of the mapping
error above I am having a hard time finding a map with imagery clear enough to
locate this cemetery. My best shot is with the red check but mapping services
label this the Well Cemetery not the Old Well Cemetery. This location is before
the trace and is labeled Well Cemetery on the topographical maps. This is an
aerial image and I don't see how it can be wrong on the placement of the trace.
Based on the best instructions one should go (past) under the trace but the spot
there on the left of the road appears to have two houses, not a place where one
finds cemeteries.</br>

</b><b>From Columbia, take Hwy 50 West to Shady Grove community;
turn left at the grocery store on Hoover Road and follow that road. You will go
under the Natchez Trace and soon will come upon the Old Well Cemetery on your
left.</br>
Supplemental instructions: Once you get on Hoover Rd (not Hoover Gap Road) from
Hwy 50, do not turn until you get to the cemetery. You must go under the Trace
around a curve and up a little hill. Old Well will then be on your left. There
are no homes on either side of the cemetery, nor directly across the road. You
will come to Old Well Cemetery before you come to Sheboss Rd.</br>
