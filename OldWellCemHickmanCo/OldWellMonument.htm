<p><b><font size="2" color="#663300">The Old Well Cemetery is located in Hickman
County at the intersection of Natchez Trace and the road to Center Star from
Kettle Mills.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#663300">This land was donated by Richard
&quot;Kettle Dick&quot; Anderson from a 2000 acre land grant he settled in 1810.
Known as &quot;The Kettle&quot;, named after a whirlpool on the Duck River, it
was good river bottom farmland with some hillside to either side of the valley.
Richard &quot;Kettle Dick&quot; was quite wealthy as seen by his will. Named
&quot;Old Well&quot; for well at NW corner of cemetery dug by Andrew Jackson's
army returning from the battle of New Orleans. Early settlers used the well as
they traveled Natchez Trace.</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#663300"><b><font size="2">Richard &quot;Kettle Dick&quot;
Anderson first married Margaret Craig daughter of Henry and Mary Erwin Craig. At
her death, he then married Sarah Cutbirth. She was a great niece of Daniel Boone
and Daniel Cutbirth, Senator.<br>
