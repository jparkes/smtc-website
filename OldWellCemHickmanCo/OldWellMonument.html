<u>Old Well Cemetery - History</u>


</p>


<p><b>The Old Well Cemetery is located in Hickman
County at the intersection of Natchez Trace and the road to Center Star from
Kettle Mills.</b></p>
<p><b>This land was donated by Richard
"Kettle Dick" Anderson from a 2000 acre land grant he settled in 1810.
Known as "The Kettle", named after a whirlpool on the Duck River, it
was good river bottom farmland with some hillside to either side of the valley.
Richard "Kettle Dick" was quite wealthy as seen by his will. Named
"Old Well" for well at NW corner of cemetery dug by Andrew Jackson's
army returning from the battle of New Orleans. Early settlers used the well as
they traveled Natchez Trace.</b></p>
<p><b>Richard "Kettle Dick"
Anderson first married Margaret Craig daughter of Henry and Mary Erwin Craig. At
her death, he then married Sarah Cutbirth. She was a great niece of Daniel Boone
and Daniel Cutbirth, Senator.<br/>
