</b>But after the little unpleasant episode in the rifle pit, I went back and
took my stand. When in early day, I saw the bright and beautiful star in the
east rise above the tree tops, and the gray fog from off the river begun to
rise, and every now and then could hear a far off chicken crow. While I was
looking toward the Yankee line, I saw a man riding leisurely along on horseback,
and singing a sort of humdrum tune. I took him to be some old citizen. He rode
on down the road toward me, and when he had approached, &quot;Who goes
there?&quot; He immediately answered, &quot;A friend.&quot; I thought that I
recognized the voice in the darkness--and said I, &quot;Who are you?&quot; He
spoke up, and gave me his name. Then, said I, &quot;Advance, friend, but you are
my prisoner.&quot; He rode on toward me, and I soon saw that it was Mr. MUMFORD
SMITH, the old sheriff of Maury county. I was very glad to see him, and as soon
as the relief guard came, I went back to camp with him. I do not remember of
ever in my life being more glad to see any person. He had brought a letter from
home, from my father, and some Confederate old issue bonds, which I was mighty
glad to get, and also a letter from &quot;the gal I left behind me,&quot;
enclosing a rosebud and two apple blossoms, resting on an arbor vita leaf, and
this on a little piece of white paper, and on this was written a motto (which I
will have to tell for the young folks), &quot;Receive me, such as I am; would
that I were of more use for your sake. JENNIE.&quot; Now, that was the bouquet
part. I would not like to tell you what was in that letter, but I read that
letter over five hundred times, and remember it today. I think I can repeat the
poetry _verbatim et literatim_, and will do so, gentle reader, if you don't
laugh at me. I'm married now, and only write from memory, and never in my life
have I read it in book or paper, and only in that letter-- &quot;I love you, O,
how dearly, Words too faintly but express; This heart beats too sincerely, E'er
in life to love you less; No, my fancy never ranges, Hopes like mine, can never
soar; If the love I cherish, changes, 'Twill only be to love you more.&quot;
Now, fair and gentle reader, this was the poetry, and you see for yourself that
there was no &quot;shenanigan&quot; in that letter; and if a fellow &quot;went
back&quot; on that sort of a letter, he would strike his &quot;mammy.&quot; And
then the letter wound up with &quot;May God shield and protect you, and prepare
you for whatever is in store for you, is the sincere prayer of JENNIE.&quot; You
may be sure that I felt good and happy, indeed. MY FRIENDS.&quot; (Co. Aytch; by
