<b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: navy">BODDIE,
Willis Henry, 10 July 1788 - 1841. 53-00-04. &quot;Born Northampton Co.,
N.C.&quot;&nbsp; The age says 35 years but the calculation is 53 years. I
believe the inscriber made a common transposition error in switching the three
and five. This is the tallest monument at Lawrence Cemetery and stands just
behind the box tombs.&nbsp;</br>
Willis Henry Boddie was the founder of the Historic antebellum Home in Mt.
Pleasant known as Walnut Grove. It was originally built in 1824 and burned to
the ground in a fire about 1856. Boddie's sister Sabra Lawrence moved to Maury
County in 1826 and lived with him in the original structure. Willis Henry died
in 1841 and Sabrina continued to live here until the fire. She rebuilt the home
after the fire. Nathan Vaught who built many of the antebellum homes in middle
Tennessee is credited with this one too, built in 1857.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>
