is safe to say that Olivia was one of the early owners of the above home in Mt
Pleasant Tennessee. Construction on the home was started in 1903 and finished in
1905 at a cost of $8,000.00, It was told to me as a young girl that the logs are
from different trees in the state of Tenn. The walls in the house are 12 inches
thick. The house has a total of 13,500 sq ft. There are three tier levels to the
yard. The tiled steps leading to the front yard are lined by very old evergreen
trees. The sandy looking spot shown on the first photo in the side yard reveals
where a large pecan tree finally died and had to be taken down.<br>
