<b></br>
Virginia Black Howard, 90, of Champaign, IL passed away 
March 21, 2011 at her home. Born July 4, 1920 in Lambert, Mississippi, to 
W.H.and Mamie Partee Black, Virginia and her family moved to Memphis, Tennessee 
in 1922. After attending Snowden Elementary, Tech High, MSCW, and Memphis State, 
Virginia met William James Howard, Jr. while both were working at DuPont. They 
married May 1, 1943. Bill III was born in 1947, Anne in 1949, and Bob in 1954. 
Bill Jr., a chemist for HumKo Oil Company, was transferred to Champaign, 
Illinois in 1957. After her husband's death in 1976, Virginia helped care for 
other family members in their homes. She enjoyed listening to all kinds of 
music, and could always be counted on to deliver an accurate play-by-play of 
each St. Louis Cardinals game. In addition to her sons in Champaign and her 
daughter in Memphis, she leaves her son-in-law Edward Dirmeyer, nieces Lane 
Greener and Peggy Copen, and great-nieces Holly Hawkins, Casey Copen, and Erin 
Copen. Graveside services will be held in Lawrence Cemetery, Mt. Pleasant, 
Tennessee at a later date. Cremation rites have been accorded. </br>
