Yes, Ruth I can. I will never forget Gene's funeral. He was the brother of my
former sister-in-law. Gene was the son of the late Rayford Hargrove and Sally
Chunn. Sally is still living (9/9/09) and lives in Murfreesboro with her
daughter Jan Young a realtor. Gene was the youngest of three children of Rayford
and Sally. He was just a few months old when his father died. <br>
Sally later married Logan Chunn (now deceased) and had two more children Dennis
and Debbie Chunn. Gene's full sisters were Janice Raye Hargrove and Ella
Hargrove. Gene was single at the time of his death, but had a steady<br>
girlfriend at the time. <br>
I will get you further information from my nephews (who are Gene's nephews) if
you desire. We visited Washington D.C. in 2004 and I have a picture of his name
on THE WALL.</font></p>

Is there anyone on this list who can tell me more about William Eugene Hargrove
who died in Viet Nam? - see below. Although he lived in Columbia, Tennessee,
I've been told his parents or grandparents were from Giles County. I'd like to
know names of his parents, siblings, and if he were married. Does anyone have a
copy of newspaper articles about his death and burial?</font></p>
