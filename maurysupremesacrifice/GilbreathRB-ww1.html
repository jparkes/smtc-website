Young Maury Countian Fell With Face To Enemy Few Days Before <span style="mso-tab-count:1">

<p class="MsoNormal"><b> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    
</span>The many friends of Lieut. Robert Brown Gilbreath, who have been clinging
to the hope that official news from him would correct the recent rumor of his
death in action, were shocked Monday when information that is credited as being
correct, was received by the stricken family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>His friends and family have nothing now on which to base any optimism,
and his death is taken as one of the inevitable horrors of war, but is all the
more deplorable that the young man was just ready to begin a career of great
usefulness when the war started.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
</span>The information was contained in a news paper clipping from the Houston
Post which was sent Mr. and Mrs. Gilbreath by a friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The notice was written by Lieut. Frank Liddell, 358<sup>th</sup>
Infantry, 90<sup>th</sup> Division, of which Robert was a member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>According to the letter of Lieut. Liddell, the fighting in which this
company was engaged was particularly fierce; only 37 Texans having survived out
of the original 250.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This fighting
took place just a few days before the signing of the armistice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Lieut. Liddell stated that he was the only officer left in the company of
original quota and continues, � Capt. Peters was killed the same morning that
I was wounded, the Boche got his body, also Lieut. Gilbreath�s, that same
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They were both killed some 150 yards on my left.�<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Lieut. Gilbreath was in Texas at the beginning of the war and received
his commission as second lieutenant at Camp Travis, San Antonio, Texas. He
arrived in Liverpool on July 4<sup>th</sup> and immediately went into action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The last letter from him was dated September 24<sup>th</sup>, and his
inability to write was due to the fact that he had been constantly in the fight.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The
fighting in which he lost his life was terrific and is further described by
Lieut. Liddell as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>�This Division has won itself some reputation, has been
congratulated several times by Gen. Pershing and Marshal Foch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We began fighting the middle of August and have been at it continually,
except for two or three days when we were moving from St. Mihiel to Argonne
Forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have been used as shock
troops and not one time have we failed to reach our objective, but we have paid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We have been through all the hell there is and now it is rumored that we
have been chosen to go into Germany, quite a compliment, though, of course, I
think we will go over and quiet things and then we will be relieved and sent
home.�</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>But
Lieut. Gilbreath will not return home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
has made the supreme sacrifice, the greatest that mortal man can make, and there
is consolation in knowing that none were braver than he, and that the enemy
saved itself from disaster by removing such as he from the great arena.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This young Maury countian was brave, he was courageous, he was inspired
by the cause for which his country was fighting; he was not being driven into
battle, but with all the force that he could command, he was leading his men
face to face with the most despicable enemy that ever cursed the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He died game, fighting like a lion, and his body was taken by the enemy
as a prize.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Few
Maury county boys had brighter prospects than Robert Gilbreath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He had a remarkably bright mind and led every class in every school he
attended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He graduated with honors
from the Columbia High School and later from the Columbia Military Academy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He later attended the University of Texas, and nothing but death could
have kept him from the presidency of some great university before he had passed
the prime of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was a young
man of strong character, high ideals and noble purposes, genial and
accommodating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was an
inspiration to his associates.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lieut.
Gilbreath is survived by his father and mother; three sisters, Misses Jennie and
Verna Gilbreath and Mrs. W. D. Patterson of Columbia; two brothers, Earl, of
Trinity College, and Claude, of Gulfport Military Academy, both of whom were in
training for commissions when the armistice was signed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He also has six half-brothers.</b></p>
<p><b>Buried: St. Mihiel
American Cemetery, France.<br/>
