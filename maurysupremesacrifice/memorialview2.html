About the same angle as the previous photo but showing different sides of the
memorial. This area view of the memorial to the War dead of Maury County is
located across from the
James Knox Polk
ancestral home, the 11th president, in Columbia Tennessee. Picture yourself
standing in the left front of the column on your right. On your left is the left
flank and on your right is the right flank. Listed on the left flank on the side
facing you is the names of those Maury County soldiers who died in the War of
1812, Mexican American War &amp; part of the Civil War. The right flank on the
side facing you contains the rest of the names of those who died in the Civil
War. On the right flank on the side away from you contains the names of the
World War I &amp; II, Korean War and the Persian Gulf War of 1992. I do not
pretend to have captured the essence of this memorial. You will have to
personally visit there for that. <i>Photo and info by Wayne Austin July 20, 2003</i></b>
