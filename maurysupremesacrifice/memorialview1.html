An area view of the memorial to the War dead of Maury County located across from the
James Knox Polk
ancestral home, the 11th president, in Columbia Tennessee. Picture yourself
standing in the left front of the column on your right. On your left is the left
flank and on your right is the right flank. Listed on the left flank on the side
facing you is the names of the War of 1812, Mexican American War &amp; part of
the Civil War. The right flank on the side facing you contains the rest of the
names of those who died in the Civil War. On the right flank on the side away
from you contains the names of the World War I &amp; II, Korean War and the
Persian Gulf War of 1992. I do not pretend to have captured the essence of this
memorial. You will have to personally visit there for that. <i>If you are aware
of the memorial stone contractor please notify this site of that information so
that we may present it here with the date. Photo and info by Wayne Austin July 20, 2003</i></b>
