This is an area view of the memorial to the War dead of Maury County located on
the grounds of the Maury County Court House in middle Tennessee. This important
historic monument was moved a couple of years ago from the grounds across from the
James Knox Polk
ancestral home, the 11th US president, to the present place here at the Court
House Grounds. Picture yourself
standing at the pivot point in front of the column. On your left is the left
flank and on your right is the right flank. Listed on the left flank on the side
facing you is the names of the War of 1812, Mexican American War &amp; part of
the Civil War. The right flank on the side facing you contains the rest of the
names of those who died in the Civil War. On the right flank on the side away
from you contains the names of the World War I &amp; II, Korean War, Vietnam War
and the
Persian Gulf War of 1992. Notice on our right the two young lads standing in front of the
trunk of the oak tree. Seated on the retaining wall is Ethan Ingram and behind
him is Andrew Gray the son of the photographer Rick Gray.<i><br/>
