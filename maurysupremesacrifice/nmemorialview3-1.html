<p>My 3rd Great Grandfather David Sanders, was mustered into Metcalfe's West
Tennessee Militia on Nov. 13th 1814as a Pvt. He served in Capt. Andrew
Patterson's Co. of Inf. 1 Reg't Tennessee Militia. I have muster rolls, saying
he died Feb. 25th, 1815. Family oral history, has it that he died in the<br/>
Battle of New Orleans, but with the death date, more likely due to
wounds,accident, or illness after the battle. Is there anyway I can find out if
he is buried at St. Louis Cemetery#1 with the others Vet's from that time
period, or somewhere else in the New Orleans area? Or in Bedford or Maury<br/>
Co's. TN. His name is on the war monument at Maury Co. Court House.</p>
